 &lt;p&gt;White House officials
have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/&quot;&gt;released guidelines to help states decide&lt;/a&gt; how —
and when — to loosen social distancing measures in a way
that prevents the coronavirus from surging back. But health experts say
beginning to open parts of society during the pandemic hinges on the
availability of widespread testing to both stamp out new flare-ups and find out
who may already have been exposed. Many people infected by SARS-CoV-2, the
virus that causes COVID-19, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-infected-people-mild-cases-symptoms-stealth-spread-china&quot;&gt;may have mild or no symptoms&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/17/&lt;/em&gt;20).   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of April 17, more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://covidtracking.com/data&quot;&gt;3.4 million coronavirus tests&lt;/a&gt; had been conducted in the United States, according to the COVID Tracking Project, which relies on state public health data. But to curb the pandemic in a country of more than 329 million people, that’s not nearly enough. As a result, researchers are racing to develop new tests that they can scale up quickly.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s where things
stand with tests for COVID-19 — including those currently used in clinics and
others under development. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;PCR-based tests&lt;/h4&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The current gold
standard for diagnostic tests is based on a method that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-testing-diagnostic-covid19-united-states&quot;&gt;searches for bits of the virus’s genetic material&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN:
3/6/20&lt;/em&gt;). Most available tests rely on swabs from a person’s nose or throat,
which are then sent to a lab where researchers use a technique called
polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, to detect tiny amounts of the coronavirus.
PCR-based tests typically take about three to four hours.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On
April 10, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved an emergency use
authorization for a COVID-19 saliva test &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/media/136875/download&quot;&gt;using
a patient’s spit&lt;/a&gt;. That test — developed by researchers at Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J.,
and now being rolled out in New Jersey — also relies on PCR to detect viral genes. But it
skips the step requiring a health care professional to swab the back of a
patient’s throat or nose. Instead, patients spit into a tube. The test aims to
help with swab shortages and protect health care workers from getting infected
from the close contact needed to take a nasal or throat swab.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Results
provided to the FDA suggest that testing saliva may be as effective as nasal
and throat swabs. A total of 30 COVID-19 patients tested positive and another 30
people without disease tested negative by both tests. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;Beyond PCR&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since traditional PCR-based
tests take time to run, researchers are also looking for solutions that give
faster results. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One test from Abbott
Laboratories, a company headquartered in Abbott Park, Ill., also works by
detecting bits of genetic material from the coronavirus in swabs. But it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/product-and-innovation/detect-covid-19-in-as-little-as-5-minutes.html&quot;&gt;gives results in five to 13 minutes&lt;/a&gt; rather than hours. The test identifies a viral
gene and then makes copies until there is a high enough amount to detect. Though
data provided to the FDA show that the rapid test agreed with expected positive
or negative results in 100 percent of samples, it has been reported that
clinicians &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/16/rapid-coronavirus-test-commonly-used-in-u-s-may-miss-infections-in-some-situations/&quot;&gt;have faced false negative results&lt;/a&gt; due to problems with sample collection.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company has said it is boosting production to around 50,000 tests per day, but many states don’t &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/local/305/2020/04/15/834998155/a-c-o-v-i-d-19-test-that-gets-results-in-minutes-rolls-out-across-d-c-region&quot;&gt;yet have enough test kits&lt;/a&gt; to test large numbers of people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The gene-editing tool
CRISPR —
best known for its potential to fix genetic mistakes that cause a host of
diseases — may also help diagnose
COVID-19 patients. One new CRISPR-based test hunts for two of the virus’s genes
in a sample. If the genes are present, CRISPR proteins will cut the genes and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0513-4&quot;&gt;spark a reaction that changes the color&lt;/a&gt; of a test strip, researchers report April 16 in &lt;em&gt;Nature
Biotechnology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Called
DETECTR, the CRISPR test can give results in around 30 to 40 minutes rather
than the four hours that current PCR tests take. But it does require higher
levels of virus in a sample to return a positive result than the &lt;s&gt;widely used&lt;/s&gt;
PCR-based diagnostic tests do, which could mean more false negative results.
When the researchers compared the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention’s PCR-based test with DETECTR, the two tests agreed that 42 samples
were negative. But DETECTR identified two samples as negative out of 40 total
that were positive by PCR — a sign that the CRISPR method could miss some
COVID-19 cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other
groups are also working to develop a CRISPR-based test, including researchers
from the University of Washington, MIT and Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;A test for exposure&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers and public
health officials are also moving beyond diagnostic tests to better understand
how far the pandemic may have spread undetected. Blood tests can help uncover &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-how-antibody-blood-tests-work&quot;&gt;people who have been exposed&lt;/a&gt; to the virus (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/27/20&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such tests look for
antibodies, an immune protein that the body produces to fight off an infection.
These proteins also stick around in the body long after the infection clears.
That allows researchers to identify people who didn’t know they had been
infected, either because the patient didn’t have symptoms or wasn’t able to get
a diagnostic test. Though a few tests have been approved recently by the FDA for
emergency use, they are not yet widely available.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s still unknown what levels of antibodies in the blood protect people from getting reinfected by the coronavirus and how long any such protection might last. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-recipes-medieval-pigment-natural-blue"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Scientists
have resurrected a purple-blue hue whose botanical origin had been lost to
time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pigment,
called folium, graced the pages of medieval manuscripts. But it fell out of use,
and the watercolor’s identity has eluded scientists for decades. Now, after tracking
down folium’s source, researchers have mapped out the chemical structure for its
blue-producing molecule. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such chemical
information can be key to art conservation. “We want to mimic these ancient
colors to know how to … preserve them,” says Maria Melo, a conservation
scientist at Universidade Nova de Lisboa in Caparica, Portugal. But to unmask
folium’s identity, Melo and her team first had to find where it came from. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The
researchers turned to medieval texts that described the source plant. With the
help of a botanist, they discovered &lt;em&gt;Chrozophora
tinctoria&lt;/em&gt;, a tiny herb with silvery-green foliage. In a village in the
south of Portugal, the team found the wild plant growing along the roadside and
in fields after harvest. Back in the lab, researchers extracted the pigment
from its pebble-sized fruits by following directions detailed in the medieval
manuscripts. “It was really great fun to recover these recipes,” Melo
says.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;an ancient book&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087079&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041720_cw_medieval-blue_inline1_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3087079&quot;&gt;During the Middle Ages, a blue watercolor called folium was popular for illustrating texts such as this book of hours from the 15th century. Now that researchers have tracked down the color’s source, prepared the dye and studied its chemistry, they may be able to find examples of it on ancient pages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087079&quot;&gt;Palácio Nacional de Mafra collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team used
a suite of analytical techniques to &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/16/eaaz7772&quot;&gt;zero in on the dye
molecule’s structure&lt;/a&gt;, it reports April 17 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;. The scientists also simulated light’s interaction
with the candidate molecule, to check whether it would give them their desired
blue. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Long-lasting blues are relatively rare among dyes, and this one is neither like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-indigo-dyed-fabric-found&quot;&gt;indigo&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/14/16) &lt;/em&gt;used in denim jeans nor an anthocyanin, such as those that show up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/borrowed-genes-give-mums-blues&quot;&gt;in many flowers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(SN: 7/26/17)&lt;/em&gt;. This newfound hue is in its own class of blues.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/SciLine-690x320px-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A guest post by Meredith Drosback, Becky Hazen, &amp;amp; Rick Weiss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has vastly increased journalists’ demand for access to scientist-sources, triggering a gold rush of sorts for articulate experts in virology, epidemiology, drug and vaccine development, and the social and psychological impacts of physical isolation, among other topics. The need for scientific expertise is especially acute among newsrooms that—as part of their all-hands-on-deck response to the pandemic—have pulled reporters onto the story who have never covered science or public health, let alone a health crisis of this magnitude. Lacking a ready bench of go-to scientists they can call, these reporters are scrambling to find trusted sources who can help them convey, accurately and clearly, health advice and insights for a nervous and news-ravenous public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this sudden increase in appetite for scientific expertise is in some respects refreshing, it has also resulted in a number of scientists being flooded with media requests, including those with little or no training in best practices for speaking to reporters. And while clear communication with the media is a skill that can most certainly be learned, it requires time and practice if counterproductive results are to be avoided. Given the ever-increasing demands of their day jobs, especially during this crisis, time is something that few scientists with pandemic-relevant expertise today have much of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciline.org/for-scientists&quot;&gt;SciLine&lt;/a&gt;, a free service based at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, has been connecting journalists to scientists for 2.5 years. Through our facilitation of more than 1,100 such interviews across print, radio, and television, we’ve observed time after time the practices and behaviors that make for an effective interaction between an expert and a reporter. Recognizing that many scientists with limited media training are being called upon to share their expertise or opinions about aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we share here some tips we have found to be most useful for a successful interview, whether you have a few minutes or a few days to get ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BEFORE&lt;/em&gt; AN INTERVIEW, WRITE DOWN 3 POINTS YOU WANT TO MAKE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider these your “vital takeaways”. If the journalist gets nothing else from the interview, what would you want them to remember and use? If you are not on camera, you can have these notes in front of you during the interview. State your points early in the conversation and repeat them as opportunities arise. Importantly, whenever possible don’t just assert these points but back them up with data and studies. You’re uniquely positioned to inject &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; into the news. In doing so you can do more than simply convey the facts; you can help remind the public there is a difference between research-backed evidence and mere opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; DESCRIBE THE BIG-PICTURE PROBLEM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if not asked, you should step back from the specific questions being asked and briefly describe the overarching issue or challenge in simple terms. Explain why addressing the larger issue demands a methodical, scientific approach, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; get into the details. Reporters often push for quick answers—to get to the point they think they need. But if you explain even briefly why this is a question that science is in the best position to answer, you again speak up not just for the findings of science but also for the scientific process itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USE ANALOGIES, VISUAL EXAMPLES, AND ANECDOTES WHEN POSSIBLE, AND AVOID JARGON.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you plan ahead for the ideas you want to convey, think about how you can make your knowledge more accessible, relatable, and memorable to nonexperts. Avoid using acronyms, abbreviations, or jargon—including terms you might not at first realize are jargon. (You may describe a mounting threat as resulting from a “positive feedback” loop, for example, but some non-scientists think “positive feedback” means “praise” and is generally a good thing!) Remember, even a single acronym or overly technical term in a sentence increases the odds that your otherwise valuable quote will end up on the cutting room floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THE PREMISE OF A QUESTION, SAY SO. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not rude to say to a journalist, &lt;em&gt;“Actually, that’s not quite right. Let me explain …” &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;“I don’t think your premise is correct. What I see is …” &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;“That may be one factor, but the bigger issue is …”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; WHEN YOU DON’T KNOW THE ANSWER, IT’S OK TO SAY SO. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As tempting as it can be when asked by a reporter to weigh in on a science-related question outside your area of expertise or to address a topic on which you are not fully up to speed, don’t risk your reputation (or, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health) by doing so. It’s okay to say: &lt;em&gt;“I’m sorry, that’s outside my area of expertise.” &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;“I don’t have the answer at my fingertips, can I get back to you on that question?” &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;“That isn’t something I focus on, but [a knowledgeable colleague you know] might be a good person to talk to.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; KEEP IN MIND THAT ANYTHING YOU SAY COULD END UP IN A STORY, AND DON’T TRY TO GO “OFF THE RECORD”. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default status for all journalistic interviews is that the reporter may quote anything you say and is not obligated to share quotes with you ahead of time for review or approval. Anything different from that default necessitates an agreement ahead of time by both parties, the reporter and the interviewee. We recommend you do not attempt to go ‘off the record’ during an interview, as that phrase can mean different things to different reporters and may result in a statement being traceable back to you. Only share remarks that you’re comfortable having attributed to you by name. Similarly, if asked a question you don’t want to answer, avoid responding by saying, &lt;em&gt;“No comment,” &lt;/em&gt;which, in itself, is a comment—and not generally taken positively. A good neutral approach is, &lt;em&gt;“I’m not prepared to talk about that right now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONFIRM YOU GOT YOUR MAIN MESSAGES ACROSS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close every interview by asking the reporter to summarize the most important points they gathered from the conversation. If they don’t include your key points in their review, or state something that isn’t quite right, this is your final opportunity clarify any misunderstandings and remind them of your main points. Whenever possible, also offer to be available for follow-up questions or fact checking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be gratifying if one result of the COVID-19 pandemic were to be a lasting increase in public and media interest in scientific expertise, and appreciation of the importance of science in decision making at every level—from personal health decisions to state and federal policy making. And it is inspiring to see so many scientists stepping up to the plate to share what they know in this time of need. Handling interactions with journalists skillfully today can pay off personally, professionally, and for society for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The brightest supernova ever seen may be the first known
example of a rare type of stellar explosion. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The supernova, spotted in 2016 in a galaxy about 4.6 billion
light-years away, radiated about 5 sexdecillion (5 followed by 51 zeros) ergs
of energy. That’s about twice the amount of radiation emitted by the previous
record-holder, and hundreds of times more energetic than normal supernovas. At
its brightest, this supernova was as bright as all the stars in the Milky Way
put together.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such a bright blast could have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1066-7&quot;&gt;a
pulsational pair-instability supernova&lt;/a&gt; — thought to occur when an extremely
massive supernova collides with a shell of material cast off by the star before
it exploded, researchers report online April 13 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Astronomy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s no single, well-established case of such a
supernova,” says Philipp Podsiadlowski, an astrophysicist at the University of
Oxford not involved in the work. “This could be one.” Computer simulations of
the event may help confirm the nature of the star’s demise. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;After the supernova, dubbed SN2016aps, was identified in
observations from the Pan-STARRS survey, astronomer Matt Nicholl and colleagues
monitored its fading light for about two years. The amount of stellar debris
left over from the supernova indicates that this star was at least 50 to 100
times as massive as the sun, whereas the stars behind ordinary supernovas are
around 10 solar masses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The telescope observations also revealed a surprising amount
of hydrogen in the wreckage. More massive stars generally lose their hydrogen
faster than smaller stars. “So, for stars in this 100-solar-mass regime, you
expect that all the hydrogen is long gone well before it explodes,” says
Nicholl, of the University of Birmingham in England. This finding suggests that
two smaller stars still containing hydrogen merged into a supersized star that
underwent a pulsational pair-instability supernova. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This exotic type of supernova is predicted to happen only to
stellar juggernauts. Inside extremely massive stars, “the temperature in the
core can get so high that photons, which are what keeps the star up and
supports it from collapsing under its own gravity, get converted into pairs of
particles — electrons and positrons,” Nicholl says. When these photons, or
particles of light, disappear, “you lose some of the pressure in the core, and
it starts to contract. This can lead to thermonuclear runaway, like an atom
bomb going off.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That explosive reaction can release enough energy to blow
off the outer layers of the star into an enormous shell. When the star
ultimately goes supernova, the explosion collides with the shell to release huge
amounts of radiation. Nicholl’s team speculates that the stellar remnant forged
during this type of supernova might be an intensely magnetic neutron star
called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-cheated-death-exploding-again-and-again&quot;&gt;magnetar&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN:
11/8/17&lt;/em&gt;), which could pump energy into an explosion to make it as bright as
the one seen in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This general scenario seems plausible to Stan Woosley, an
astrophysicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, not involved in the
work. But the size of the star that underwent this explosion leads him to think
that the 2016 supernova may have forged a black hole, instead of making a magnetar.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bats are apparently able to imitate specific sounds, an ability shown by just a few other mammals and some birds&lt;/strong&gt;. The bats’ calls were recorded, and the sound manipulated before being played back to them. Within a month, the bats had learned to copy the sounds in exchange for a food reward, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2240435-bats-can-learn-to-copy-sounds-and-it-may-teach-us-about-human-speech/&quot;&gt;reports Layal Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;. Studying vocal production in other animals can help psycholinguists understand the evolution of human speech.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39479&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new drug candidate for the treatment of schizophrenia has shown promising results in a clinical trial. &lt;/strong&gt;The compound SEP-363856, developed by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, reduced symptoms in patients who were early in the course of schizophrenia, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/experimental-schizophrenia-drug-could-reduce-long-neglected-symptoms?rss=1&quot;&gt;repots Kelly Servick&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. This appeared to include a decrease in negative symptoms like blunted emotion, which are notoriously difficult to treat, although further research is needed to confirm these findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being considered a “weirdo” or outsider clearly has its downsides — but it may also boost your creativity&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/04/the-perks-of-being-a-weirdo/606778/&quot;&gt;writes Olga Khazan&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic. &lt;/em&gt;Various studies have found that people who do not fit into a particular group tend to show greater creative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know that our mental health is influenced by our interactions with family members — so a new programme seeks to treat childhood anxiety indirectly, by providing sessions for parents instead of children themselves&lt;/strong&gt;. Recent trials suggest that Supportive Parenting for Anxious Childhood Emotions may be as effective as CBT at treating children’s anxiety, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4agzvm/giving-parents-therapy-can-help-their-anxious-children?utm_source=reddit.com&quot;&gt;reports Shayla Love&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How might social isolation affect our mental and physiological health?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2020/apr/15/covid-19-how-can-social-isolation-affect-us-podcast&quot;&gt;Ian Sample talks to Carmine Pariante&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Guardian’s &lt;/em&gt;“Science Weekly” podcast to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of course, there’s one career where regular social isolation is part of the job description: astronaut. &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200408-an-astronauts-guide-to-surviving-isolation&quot;&gt;Tiffanie Wen gets some tips&lt;/a&gt; from an astronaut who spent months on the International Space Station and an engineer who lived in a dome in Hawaii to simulate life on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During the pandemic, pornography use has increased — perhaps not a huge surprise, given that we know people turn to porn to cope with negative feelings and boredom&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/porn-use-is-up-thanks-to-the-pandemic-134972&quot;&gt;writes Joshua B. Grubbs&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;. “For most users, pornography is probably just another distraction – one that might actually help “flatten the curve” by keeping people safely occupied and socially distanced,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, social media has been ablaze with people reporting experiencing vivid, coronavirus-related dreams.&lt;/strong&gt; But why are so many of us having these dreams? There are a number of causes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/coronavirus-dreams-sleep&quot;&gt;reports Will Pritchard&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired: &lt;/em&gt;partly, these kinds of dreams are natural response to stress and trauma, but they may also reflect the simple fact that many of us are getting more sleep (and particularly REM sleep) than before.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-6-feet-may-not-be-enough-social-distance"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3087061</id>
		<updated>2020-04-17T10:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;In February, a man in Chicago brought
food to and hugged two friends who had recently lost a family member. The next
day, the man went to the funeral, where he comforted other mourners and shared
a potluck meal. A few days later, he attended a family birthday party. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The man had symptoms of a mild
respiratory illness. Later he’d learn he had COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His acts of condolence and celebration
set off a chain reaction that sickened at least 16 people, three of whom died. At
the time, social distancing measures weren’t yet in place in Chicago. COVID-19
had yet to circulate widely in the area. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The case now serves as a cautionary tale,
underscoring recommendations for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6915e1.htm&quot;&gt;people to keep their
distance&lt;/a&gt; from anyone outside their immediate household, researchers report
April 8 in &lt;em&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report&lt;/em&gt;. But how much distance is needed to avoid
spreading the coronavirus? &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Six feet (or two meters) has become the
mantra. The World Health Organization and other experts have said SARS-CoV-2,
the virus that causes COVID-19, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/modes-of-transmission-of-virus-causing-covid-19-implications-for-ipc-precaution-recommendations&quot;&gt;spread
mainly by large droplets&lt;/a&gt; sprayed when people cough or sneeze, contaminating
surfaces. So that degree of separation, combined with frequent hand-washing, was
thought to be enough to halt or at least slow the spread of the virus.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But new evidence suggests six feet of distance may not be enough. If SARS-CoV-2 is airborne, as scientists think it may be, people could be infected simply by inhaling the virus in tiny aerosol droplets exhaled by someone talking or breathing.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s actually safe is unknown. It may depend
on many factors, including whether people are inside or outdoors, how loudly
people are speaking, whether they are wearing masks, how well-ventilated a room
is, and how far the virus can really fly. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;Say it, spray it&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When people exhale, talk, sing, cough or sneeze, a cloud of droplets of various sizes leaves the mouth or nose, says Lydia Bourouiba, a fluid dynamicist at MIT. Most simulations of droplet behavior have considered big and small droplets separately. Researchers have worried mainly about bigger droplets — 5 to 10 micrometers in diameter or larger — as vehicles for transmitting viruses, bacteria or other contagious organisms. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bigger droplets can pack in more
infectious organisms, giving a greater chance of infection if someone comes into
contact with them. But the bigger the droplets are, the heavier they become, dropping
fairly quickly to the ground. Such droplets are thought rarely to travel more
than a meter or two before hitting the ground or another surface. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those droplets might infect people by direct
contact, such as when someone coughs or sneezes right in your face. But
researchers think indirect contact is the main way people catch viruses, says
Qingyan Chen, a mechanical engineer studying how infectious diseases spread at
Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. Indirect contact might involve an
infected person using their hand to cover a cough or a sneeze, then touching a
cup or another object. If an uninfected person handles the object, the virus
could transfer to that person’s hands. An unwitting nose scratch, eye rub or
finger food snack could then infect that person. That’s why handwashing is so
important.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Breathing in smaller droplets, known as
aerosols, exhaled or coughed up by an infected person may also cause infection.
Tiny droplets have a hard time overcoming drag from air and are thought to hang
around a person, within a meter (a few feet). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hence the six-foot rule: It was thought
to be far enough to be safe from both occasional long-range spit bullets and
invisible clouds of smaller particles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But droplets spewed from people’s lungs come in a continuum of sizes, from those big enough to see with the naked eye to microscopic droplets churning through the air as a turbulent cloud, Bourouiba says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This
cloud, in fact, changes everything about the dispersal of the drops that you
don’t really see,” she says. The warm, moist exhaled air within the turbulent
cloud has forward momentum from breathing, coughing or sneezing, carrying
droplets of all sizes much farther than previously thought. In the case of a
sneeze, droplets &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852&quot;&gt;can travel up to eight meters&lt;/a&gt; (23 to 27 feet), Bourouiba reports March 26
in &lt;em&gt;JAMA.&lt;/em&gt; That means even small
droplets may spread throughout a room. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And
if droplets fly that far, the virus may, too. “There’s no reason to believe
that the virus only stays in those [droplets] that fall close by,” she says.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coughs
also can propel aerosol droplets beyond six feet, evidence suggests. Over three
flu seasons, fluid mechanics engineer Eric Savory at the University of Western
Ontario in London, Canada, and colleagues persuaded sick people to cough into a
large box that allowed the researchers to measure how fast and far respiratory
viruses travel. The volunteers coughed while they were sick with influenza, RSV
or cold-causing coronaviruses. Some came back after they were feeling well to
cough for science again. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even
a meter away from the mouth, coughs are still &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediarelations.uwo.ca/2020/04/14/cough-chamber/&quot;&gt;traveling at about a meter per second&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers discovered. “It’s not a
speed you can avoid by turning your head away,” Savory says. Volunteers who
were either ill, convalescent or healthy all coughed at about the same
velocity. Results of the study will appear in an upcoming issue of &lt;em&gt;Indoor Air&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The
small droplets do slow down as they get farther from the mouth, Savory says. But
his data don’t suggest what’s a safe distance. “A good guidance is you’re
lessening your risk [of infection] the farther you are away from someone.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Researchers measured the velocity of coughs. Even a meter away from the mouth, droplets in the center of the cough cloud are moving at about a meter per second (green). These speeds suggest keeping six feet distance from other people may not be enough to prevent the virus from spreading in a cough.  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Singing to the choir&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The smallest airborne droplets may be more
of a worry than scientists previously recognized.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aerosol droplets containing infectious SARS-CoV-2
particles can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973&quot;&gt;hang
around in the air for hours&lt;/a&gt;, a March 17
study in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of
Medicine&lt;/em&gt; found. The experiment, conducted under lab conditions, measured
air samples for only three hours, but found still-infectious viruses. Some
researchers have criticized that study because the virus-laden droplets were
made using a medical machine, not by methods that more closely mimic breathing.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But people experience the spread of
aerosol particles every day, says William Ristenpart, a chemical engineer at
the University of California, Davis. If someone on one side of a large room
lights a cigarette, puts on perfume or opens a box of chocolate chip cookies,
the smell eventually reaches the other side of the room. “It’s not because [the
smoker/perfume wearer/cookie eater is] coughing,” he says. Turbulence created
by air mixing carries aerosol droplets around the room. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ristenpart investigates whether
influenza and other respiratory diseases can spread by airborne particles. The coronavirus’s
contagiousness is a clue that it might, he says. Researchers at the U.S.
National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine also concluded in an
April 1 report that the virus might &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-breathing-talking-enough-spread-airborne&quot;&gt;spread
through aerosol particles&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/2/20&lt;/em&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add to that the fact that people can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms&quot;&gt;spread
the virus before they develop symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, or without ever developing symptoms
(&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/13/20&lt;/em&gt;). In fact, COVID-19 may
be most contagious &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-infection-contagious-days-before-symptoms-appear&quot;&gt;one
to two days before symptoms appear&lt;/a&gt;, when people don’t even know they are
infectious (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/15/20&lt;/em&gt;). Almost half
of people in Iceland who tested &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2006100?query=featured_home&quot;&gt;positive
for COVID-19 didn’t have symptoms&lt;/a&gt; when diagnosed, researchers report April
14 in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.
Many would probably develop symptoms later, says Kári Stefánsson, founder of deCODE Genetics, a Reykjavik-based
company screening anyone who wants a test. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By definition, people without symptoms
aren’t coughing and sneezing. But they are talking and breathing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And singing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aerosol particles released when people
sing may have led the coronavirus to spread to 45 members of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://9b3c1cdb-8ac7-42d9-bccf-4c2d13847f41.filesusr.com/ugd/3e7440_635a114fead240e1a02bc2c872a852de.pdf&quot;&gt;Skagit
Valley Chorale&lt;/a&gt; in Washington. Two died. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some choir members met for practice on
March 3 and 10 before Washington state issued a stay-home order and before Skagit
County had any known COVID-19 cases. Choir members reportedly kept six-foot
distance from each other. But in belting out tunes, whistling and talking to
one another, infected choir members may have propelled the virus into each others’
safety zones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A good singer knows how to use all the
air in their lungs,” says Donald Milton, an infectious disease specialist at
the University of Maryland School of Public Health in College Park. That may
lead to exhaling lots of coronavirus, or breathing it deep into the lungs
during breaths between refrains. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2020.1749229&quot;&gt;talking
face-to-face with an infected&lt;/a&gt; but asymptomatic person may be enough to spread
the virus, Ristenpart and colleagues propose April 3 in &lt;em&gt;Aerosol Science and Technology&lt;/em&gt;. Standing six feet apart might cause
people to raise their voices to be heard, and people produce more aerosols and
larger &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-38808-z#citeas&quot;&gt;droplets
the louder they speak&lt;/a&gt;, Ristenpart and colleagues reported in February 2019 in
&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;. “There’s a
compelling case that one should be suspicious of conversation as a possible
vector for transmission,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2007800?query=featured_home&quot;&gt;Speech
generates hundreds of big, wet drops&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report April 15 in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. “Stay
healthy” is, ironically, a phrase that sprays a lot of saliva droplets. But
that study was not capable of measuring droplets smaller than 20 micrometers
across, says Matthew Meselson, a biologist at Harvard University who wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2009324&quot;&gt;a comment on the
study&lt;/a&gt;, also appearing April 15 in &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt;.
Other studies have determined that talking produces thousands of aerosols from
the lungs for every saliva droplet from the mouth, he says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s too early to tell whether aerosols
and big droplets produce different severities of infection, he says. The
pandemic may change doctors’ and researchers’ view of how respiratory viruses
in general spread, Meselson says. “I think we’ll find we really were behind the
curve when it comes to thinking about how disease is transmitted through the
air.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Masks to the rescue?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Findings about aerosol spread and symptom-free spread led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend that everyone wear masks in public. With medical-grade masks in short supply and needed for health care workers, that recommendation has led to a rush to create &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-ppe-face-mask-shortages-creative-solutions&quot;&gt;homemade cloth or 3-D printed masks&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/27/20&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies of medical grade masks have
demonstrated that they can block the forward flow of large particles, but
aerosols still shoot out of the sides and top of surgical masks. Few studies
have addressed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-can-fabric-cloth-masks-stem-coronavirus-spread&quot;&gt;effectiveness
of homemade masks&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/9/20&lt;/em&gt;). And
no one knows exactly how many coronavirus particles are necessary to start an
infection. For some viruses, as few as one virus may be enough. But even if a
cloth mask filters out only 10 percent of virus particles, “in a pandemic,
maybe it’s worth doing,” says Milton, the University of Maryland infections
disease specialist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A mask of any sort may help the mask
wearer release fewer droplets into the air, which helps to protect people
around the wearer. Masks reduce the momentum of the exhaled cloud of droplets, diverting
flow and reducing the range the particles can travel. But a mask “does not
replace social distancing,” Bourouiba says. “It is not high-grade protection
that people should feel overconfident about.” 
&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;Going with the flow&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even with a mask, six feet may not be a safe distance. Airflow is a big factor in determining how far is safe enough, says Chen, the Purdue mechanical engineer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Indoors, heating and air conditioning
units may draw virus-laden air toward certain parts of a room. But the systems
may also bring in fresh air and cycle out stale air containing viruses and
other particles. Ceiling fans and other fans may also blow the virus around a room.
In such settings, it may be hard to figure out where best to evade the virus. Just
as with indoor smoking, Milton says, “you’ll be trapped in that atmosphere.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a good idea to keep six feet between
grocery store patrons, but whether it’s really safe is another matter, Meselson
says. “There’s no magic about six feet,” he says. “It’s better than two feet,
and 10 feet is better than six, but for aerosol, I don’t know what to say.”
Aerosol particles can linger long after a shopper has gone home, potentially
infecting workers or people who visit the store later. His advice: “Try not to
go into any enclosed space if you have any reason to believe there was an
infected person inside.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Outside, six feet is probably a safe
distance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Six feet may be OK when asymptomatic
individuals are talking outdoors, Bourouiba says, particularly if both are
wearing masks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Savory, the Western University engineer
studying coughs, agrees. “The advice that is being given is really sound. It’s
a good compromise to be two meters away from someone,” he says. “This distance
dramatically reduces the transmission capability of this virus and indeed any
virus. If you want to be more safe, you should stay away as far as you can.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Six feet may also be OK when it comes to
the huffs and puffs of exercise. People exercising outdoors run the risk of
stepping into another person’s exhalation cloud, but then outdoor airflow may
quickly dissipate the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you’re walking, you’re walking
through your exhaled breath with every step, but it’s quite well diluted,” says
Julian Tang, a virologist and fluid dynamicist at the University of Leicester
in England. And there is little side-to-side air movement, so stepping off the
path to walk by someone else carries little risk, he says. “It’s quite
transient. They’re coming towards me, and then they’re gone.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the idea of a “safe” distance
outdoors depends on if, and which way, the wind is blowing. A breeze may carry
virus-laden breath farther than six feet, Milton says. “If there’s a strong
breeze blowing, probably nobody should be downwind from each other.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-made-southwestern-u-s-drought-worst-1200-years"/>

		<updated>2020-04-16T18:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The drought in southwestern
North America that lasted from 2000 to 2018 is among the most severe to strike
the region in the last 1,200 years, a new study finds. Tree ring–based
reconstructions of past climate reveal just one drier 19-year period: a
powerful “megadrought” in the late 16th century. The recent drought,
researchers say, &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aaz9600&quot;&gt;was made 47 percent more severe by human-caused
climate change&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tree rings are yearly growth
bands of variable width, depending upon the ready availability of water. Using
tree ring records from 1,586 sites across the western United States and
northwestern Mexico — amounting to thousands of trees — hydroclimatologist Park
Williams of Columbia University and colleagues created a climate history for
the region going back to about the year 800. Between about 850 and 1600,
several decades-long, intense “megadroughts” struck the region, on a scale not
seen again until the present day, the researchers report in the April 17 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A particularly devastating
drought that lasted from about 1575 to 1593 is recounted in historical records
and tree ring reconstructions alike, Williams says. “That was a really
impressive event, and kind of the last gasp of the megadrought era,” he says.
The drought may have contributed to the abandonment of New Mexico pueblos and
the devastating spread of disease brought by Spanish conquistadors among Native
Americans. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest factors
controlling precipitation in southwestern North America is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fizzled-2014-el-nino-fired-ongoing-monster-el-nino&quot;&gt;El Niño-Southern Oscillation&lt;/a&gt;, a natural cycle in which changes in tropical Pacific
Ocean temperatures can alter regional weather patterns (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/2/16&lt;/em&gt;). During
“La Niña” episodes of this pattern, colder Pacific sea surface temperatures create
atmospheric waves that block Pacific storms from reaching southwestern North
America, reducing rainfall. The 16th century megadrought, for example, coincided
with a powerful La Niña event. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Tree rings&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087039&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041620_CG_drought_inline-680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3087039&quot;&gt;Using tree rings, such as seen in this cross section of a ponderosa pine from north of Tucson, Ariz., researchers determined that the 2000–2018 drought in southwestern North America was one of the most severe in the last 1,200 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087039&quot;&gt;Park Williams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Over the last two decades,
we’ve had a cluster of more La Niña–like years than El Niño–like years,” Williams says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But La Niña alone was not
responsible for the intensity of the recent drought, the team found. The
scientists examined 31 climate simulations and stripped away underlying common temperature
and precipitation trends related to human-caused climate change, leaving only
natural variability. In that hypothetical modern world, they found, the recent
drought would have been 47 percent less severe. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;These
findings add to mounting evidence that rising global temperatures in the last
few decades have exacerbated the impact of reduced precipitation from La Niña
events, for example, by further drying out soils and reducing snowpack and river
flow, says paleoclimatologist Connie Woodhouse of the University of Arizona in
Tucson, who was not involved in the study. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Williams notes that a wet 2019
offered a brief respite to the region — just as megadroughts in the past
contained the odd wet year. Dry conditions resumed in 2020, and climate
simulations for the next few decades predict both increasing temperatures and
reduced precipitation in this part of the world. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The take-home is that the West
is in a serious drought; not [just] the worst in 50 years, but on a
millennial-type timescale of importance,” Williams says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Natural variability, like an
El Niño year that could bring more rain to the region, could help alleviate
drought over the next century, he adds. But “as time goes on, it’s going to
take more and more good luck to end these types of droughts, and less and less
bad luck to go into one of these droughts again.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/weather-forecasters-predict-very-active-2020-atlantic-hurricane-season"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3087034</id>
		<updated>2020-04-16T17:25:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The Atlantic hurricane
season is &lt;a href=&quot;https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/video/hurricane-season-forecast-to-be-above-average&quot;&gt;likely to be very active&lt;/a&gt;, fueled by very
warm ocean temperatures in the tropics,
according to several forecasts including a report released April 16 by The
Weather Channel. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A total of 18 named storms — nine of them hurricanes — are predicted in the season starting June 1, according
to the Atlanta-based weather forecasting company, which is owned by IBM. That’s
higher than the seasonal average of 12 named storms, including six hurricanes, determined
by the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Four of the hurricanes forecast
by the Weather Channel are expected to be “major hurricanes” of Category 3 or
higher, with sustained winds of at least 178 kilometers per hour (111 miles per
hour). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other researchers have also
predicted above-normal activity for the year, including forecasters at &lt;a href=&quot;https://tropical.colostate.edu/media/sites/111/2020/04/2020-04.pdf&quot;&gt;Colorado State University&lt;/a&gt; in Fort Collins and the University of Arizona in
Tucson, as well as a consortium of risk experts known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tropicalstormrisk.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tropical
Storm Risk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at University College
London. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;All of these groups cited very
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/warm-tropical-atlantic-waters-juiced-2017-hurricane-season&quot;&gt;high sea-surface temperatures&lt;/a&gt;, or SST, in the tropical Atlantic Ocean as a key
reason for the expected activity (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/28/18&lt;/em&gt;). Warm moist air evaporating from the ocean acts as fuel for
hurricanes, pumping water into the atmosphere that then gets carried higher by
converging winds until it rains out, releasing more heat and driving the cycle
forward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “Atlantic SST is forecasted to be one of the
warmest since 1993,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://has.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/ua_tropical_cyclone_forecast_in_april_2020.pdf&quot;&gt;researchers with the University of Arizona&lt;/a&gt; noted April 13. It was the first time the team
released its forecast in April, rather than June. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; Several analyses, including the Weather
Channel’s, also suggest that a La Niña weather pattern may develop by late
summer. La Niña, the flipside of El Niño, is a cyclical phenomenon that brings
cooler waters to the tropical Pacific Ocean and changes wind patterns over the
Atlantic in ways that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/super-el-nino-over-la-nina-looms&quot;&gt;can help strengthen hurricanes&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/9/16&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Our journals which are selective for novelty — PLOS Biology, PLOS Medicine, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases and PLOS Pathogens — have all revised their ‘scooping’ policy to waive the novelty criteria for work submitted within six months of a similar study having been published. If your almost-completed work was ‘scooped’ by a study published today, it will still be considered novel by these journals, giving you the time to rigorously complete it and submit it within the next six months.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;What is a better demonstration of the reproducibility of a piece of research than two or more labs independently and rigorously conducting the same work in parallel? Whether they reach similar results or uncover intriguing differences, the studies complement and add value to each other, providing validation or additional insight. Yet, in the current incentives landscape in scientific research, it too often matters most to be first. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The effects of this flawed incentive system are particularly acute in the life and biomedical sciences. Because of it, labs aware of competition race to complete a study and publish it first, researchers are wary of posting results on preprint servers or presenting unpublished results at conferences to avoid tipping off competitors. And yes, in that race to be first the temptation to cut corners can be high. Because if you come second, your study will most likely be rejected from your journal of choice for not being deemed novel. You will likely endure the protracted journey of finding a journal that will consider your work, or find yourself in need of adding more results to provide ‘sufficiently novel insight’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It doesn’t have to be like that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Inspired by a desire to nudge the norms of research assessment, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; pioneered an expanded &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2005203&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;‘complementary research’ policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; in 2018. Under that policy, manuscripts that confirm or extend a recently published study are eligible for consideration at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. The editors’ experience has been exemplary — the ‘scooped’ studies they considered were thorough, of high quality and their comparison with the complementary study provided even more value to the research question. Two of the first researchers who experienced the policy first-hand &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2006843&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;wrote about it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; eloquently. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Across PLOS, we’ve been watching the reactions to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; policy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; of course never considered novelty as a criterion, but until recently the existing policy at all other journals was to protect from ‘scooping’ from the time of submission only. The experience of a highly-selective journal like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; when it expanded this protection period to six months before submission was intriguing to all, and editors started becoming more lenient about scooping. The results from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and the experience across the portfolio convinced the Editors-in-Chief of all PLOS journals of the value of this policy for scientific research in general and all PLOS journals now have adopted the same policy (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/s/complementary-research&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;see for example PLOS Genetics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We hope that for all researchers intent on conducting rigorous research this helps relieve the pressure to submit before others, allowing them to do all proper controls and analyses that make their results more robust. We also hope that other journals and research assessors take note so that ultimately the norms can change across the landscape. As a widely-adopted policy, this would be a game-changer for researchers whose careers hang on the prominence of their publications and revolutionize the way we plan, execute and attribute credit for scientific research.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;After all, we should all recognize that being first is not always the most important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The sharpest images yet taken of the sun’s atmosphere reveal
superfine threads of hot plasma draped across small regions that have appeared
rather bland until now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finding these slender strands is essential for understanding
how energy moves around in the sun’s atmosphere, says Amy Winebarger, a solar
physicist at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. Such intel
could help astronomers understand why the corona — the outer part of the sun’s
atmosphere — is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2017-solar-eclipse-hot-corona&quot;&gt;hundreds
of times hotter than the sun’s surface&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/20/17&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the newfound filaments &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab6dcf&quot;&gt;measure just
over 200 kilometers wide&lt;/a&gt; — they would barely fit between Washington,
D.C., and Philadelphia. No one has seen them before because previous images could
not resolve such fine detail in the solar corona. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;UV image of plasma on the sun&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3087010&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041520_cc_sun_inline1_rev.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3087010&quot;&gt;Fine threads of plasma (dark lines in box) appear in this ultraviolet image of a magnetically active region on the sun from NASA’s Hi-C suborbital telescope. The entire image spans a region roughly 191,000 kilometers on a side — nearly 15 times as wide as Earth. The faint square is an artifact from the telescope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3087010&quot;&gt;University of Central Lancashire, NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pictures come courtesy of NASA’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://hic.msfc.nasa.gov/&quot;&gt;High-Resolution Coronal
Imager&lt;/a&gt;, or Hi-C. This small ultraviolet telescope occasionally gets
hurled into space atop a rocket and then has about five minutes to snap
pictures of the sun before falling back to Earth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing threads pop out where we see nothing in other
instruments,” says Winebarger, a coauthor of the new study, published in the April
1 &lt;em&gt;Astrophysical Journal&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hi-C spotted the solar gossamer during its second successful flight in May 2018, during which it zeroed in on a region of the sun bursting with magnetic activity. The areas laced with plasma threads in the Hi-C images appear as just a muddle of light in concurrent images from NASA’s orbiting &lt;a href=&quot;https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/&quot;&gt;Solar Dynamics Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, hinting that ever smaller structures on the sun are still waiting to be discovered.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you an evening person — an owl? Or a morning person — a lark? No end of studies have reported variations in the functioning of people who like to wake and go to bed late, versus those who are early to bed and early to rise. And now a new study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230169&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;PLoS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has found links between our “chronotype” and the way we handle emotions, reflect on our thoughts and feelings, and assert ourselves. Overall, owls do worse. And this, argues Juan Manuel Antúnez at the University of Malaga, Spain, could help to explain links between being an owl and poorer psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39466&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Antúnez recruited 2,283 healthy Spanish men and women, aged 18-60 years, to complete a series of online questionnaires. First, their chronotype was assessed. This revealed that about 28% were owls, about 23% were larks, and the rest were neither. (This is similar to the estimated spread in the general population, with about 20% of us falling into each of the extreme groups and the remaining 60% in the middle.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants also completed a questionnaire that explored their use of two different strategies for emotional regulation: “cognitive reappraisal”, which involves reframing a stressful situation to lessen its emotional impact and is related to greater well-being; and emotion suppression, which is maladaptive and is related to psychological problems like depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another scale assessed participants’ meta-cognitions — the way they think about their thoughts and feelings. This scale included measures of maladaptive thought processes about feelings (for example, thinking that worry is useful for avoiding future problems) and thoughts (such as: “I should be controlling my thoughts all of the time” and “I am constantly aware of my thinking”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final measure asked the participants to report their own level of assertiveness — their tendency to (non-aggressively) affirm a right or a point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responses showed that chronotype was indeed related to these measures. The closer a participant was to the lark extreme, the more likely they were to use (beneficial) cognitive reappraisal to regulate their emotions. Those who were closer to the owl extreme were more likely to use suppression, however. This strategy has been related to all kinds of problems, including depression and decreased well-being, self-esteem, and social functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owls also scored highest for maladaptive ways of thinking about their thoughts and feelings. And they reported the lowest levels of assertiveness, while larks reported the highest. Assertiveness is a core skill for well-being, Antúnez notes, so could protect against psychological problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results held even after controlling for gender and age-related differences. And for all the measures, those with an intermediate chronotype — who were neither owl nor lark — scored in the middle zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, biologically-speaking, owls only “wake up” later in the day, after normal school and work start times, they are out of sync with most countries’ daily routines. This “social jetlag” has been linked to greater fatigue. Perhaps that fatigue drives the poorer owl results on the measures in his study, Antúnez suggests. But, as he says, studies that follow people over time will be required to explore this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, “although future longitudinal studies are needed,” he writes, “[the] results emphasize evening-type as a risk factor for the development of psychological disturbances and morning-type as a protective factor against those.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230169&quot;&gt;Circadian typology is related to emotion regulation, metacognitive beliefs and assertiveness in healthy adults&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The first sign that Albert Einstein’s
theory of gravity was correct has made a repeat appearance, this time near a supermassive
black hole. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 1915, Einstein realized that his newly formulated general theory of relativity explained a weird quirk in the orbit of Mercury. Now, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/04/aa37813-20/aa37813-20.html&quot;&gt;same effect has been found&lt;/a&gt; in a star’s orbit of the enormous black hole at the heart of the Milky Way, researchers with the GRAVITY collaboration report April 16 in&lt;em&gt; Astronomy &amp;amp; Astrophysics&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The star, called S2, is part of a
stellar entourage that surrounds the Milky Way’s central black hole. For
decades, researchers have tracked S2’s elliptical motion around the black hole.
The researchers previously had used observations of S2 to identify a different
effect of general relativity, the reddening of the star’s light due to what’s
called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-orbiting-black-hole-einstein-gravity-general-relativity&quot;&gt;gravitational redshift&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/26/18&lt;/em&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, they’ve determined that the ellipse
rotates over time, what’s known as Schwarzschild precession. That precession is
the result of the warping of spacetime caused by massive objects, according to
general relativity. A similar precession in Mercury’s orbit had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-general-relativity-mercury-orbit&quot;&gt;stumped scientists before Einstein came along&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/11/18&lt;/em&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While physicists have never found a case
where general relativity fails, they are searching for any cracks in the theory
that could help lead to a new, improved theory of gravity. The new study
confirms that Einstein’s theory checks out once again, even in the intense
gravitational environment around a supermassive black hole.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-infection-contagious-days-before-symptoms-appear"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;People with coronavirus infections may
be most contagious one to two days before they start to feel ill, new research
suggests. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, considering pairs of people in which one person definitely caught the coronavirus from the other, scientists estimate that about 44 percent of COVID-19 cases may spread from person to person &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5&quot;&gt;before symptoms appear&lt;/a&gt;. The results indicate that efforts to track down contacts of people with COVID-19 should include people encountered several days before a person’s symptoms start, researchers suggest April 15 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists swabbed the noses of 94
coronavirus patients who were admitted to the Guangzhou Eighth People’s
Hospital in China from January 21 through February 14. Amounts of the virus’s
genetic material peaked quickly after the onset of symptoms, then declined over
about 21 days, the team found. That result indicates that virus production may
be strongest at the start of the infection before the immune system kicks in to
kill viruses and produce symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Analyzing 77 infector-infectee pairs
allowed researchers to calculate when people are most contagious. The team estimates
that contagiousness starts 2.3 days before symptoms begin and peaks 0.7 days
before symptoms start.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those estimates are similar to findings based
on a small number of people with COVID-19 in Germany, in which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms&quot;&gt;researchers
isolated actual infectious virus, versus just genetic material, from the
patients&lt;/a&gt;. That study found that infectious virus is produced before
symptoms begin and in the first week of illness (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/13/20&lt;/em&gt;). One person in that study was asymptomatic, meaning he
never even developed symptoms, but still produced infectious virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tracing contacts and isolating cases alone may not be successful at stopping more outbreaks if more than 30 percent of cases result from presymptomatic or asymptomatic transmission, the authors of the new study say. If that’s the case, more than 90 percent of contacts would need to be identified to contain viral spread. Increased handwashing and continued social distancing for everyone are probably also going to be needed for controlling the pandemic in the absence of COVID-19 treatments or a vaccine, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Quantum computing’s deep freeze is
beginning to thaw.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Computers that harness quantum physics
could trump standard computers on certain types of calculations. But the
machines typically work only at temperatures tiny fractions of a degree above
absolute zero. Now, two teams of physicists report that they’ve created silicon-based
quantum computers that work under warmer conditions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The devices operate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2171-6&quot;&gt;more than a degree above absolute zero&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2170-7&quot;&gt;in two papers&lt;/a&gt;
published in the April 16 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. Although
still chilly, that temperature is much easier to achieve than the approximately
10 millikelvin (0.01 degrees above absolute zero) temperatures typical of a
popular type of quantum computer based on superconductors, materials which
transmit electricity without resistance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current quantum computers top out at
around 50 quantum bits, but scientists expect quantum computers will need
millions of these qubits to perform some tasks. So scientists are working to scale
them up. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simplifying the cooling process could
help the computers grow. That’s because extremely cold quantum computers have
an additional complication. The electronic components required to control the
qubits don’t work under such chilly conditions, and need to be kept in a warmer
location and connected to the quantum chip with wiring. That wiring would become
unreasonably complex as quantum computers scale up.  But with quantum computers that operate at
these warmer temperatures, the qubits and electronics could be joined together,
akin to the integrated circuits that helped make conventional computers
increasingly powerful and ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Created by teams including researchers from
the University of New South Wales in Australia and QuTech in Delft, the Netherlands, the warmer quantum
computers are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-go-silicon&quot;&gt;made with silicon&lt;/a&gt;. That material is used in standard computer chips, so manufacturers
are already skilled with it (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/14/18&lt;/em&gt;).
That could also speed quantum computers’ scale-up.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Joseph Schubert spends hours at a time lying in the dirt of the
Australian outback watching for tiny flickers in the sparse, ground-hugging foliage.
The 22-year-old arachnologist is searching for flea-sized peacock spiders, and
he admits, he’s a little obsessed.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t always so. Schubert grew up fearing spiders, with parents
who were “absolutely terrified” of the eight-legged crawlers. “I was taught
that every single spider in the house was going to kill me, and we should
squish it and get rid of it,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then Schubert stumbled across some photographs of Australia’s endemic
peacock spiders, a group named for the adult males’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-structures-give-peacock-spider-its-radiant-rump&quot;&gt;vivid
coloring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/male-peacock-spiders-best-dancers-get-girl&quot;&gt;flamboyant
dance moves&lt;/a&gt; aimed at wooing a mate (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/9/16; SN: 12/8/15&lt;/em&gt;). And he was hooked. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They raise their third pair of legs and dance around and show off like
they are the most amazing animals on the planet, which in my eyes they are.” He
decided to pursue a career in arachnology. And despite not quite having
completed his undergraduate degree in biology, he’s begun working part time at Museums
Victoria in Melbourne, and has already made a mark.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Of the 86 known peacock spider species — each just 2.5 to 6 millimeters in
length — 12 have been described by Schubert, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.4758.1.1&quot;&gt;seven named&lt;/a&gt; in the March 27 &lt;em&gt;Zootaxa&lt;/em&gt;.
Those seven were found at a range of sites across Australia, including the
barren dunes and shrublands of Victoria state’s Little Desert and the red rocks
and arid outback gorges of Kalbarri National Park, north of Perth.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a fantastic feeling
to be able to document these species and empower them with names” that offer
scientific recognition as well as a chance for legislated protections if
needed, Schubert says. “I am very lucky to work in this field. I get to pull
out my microscope and observe things that nobody has ever documented before.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Joseph Schubert&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3086913&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/040820_JP_peacock-spider_inline-680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3086913&quot;&gt;Joseph Schubert searches for spiders at Little Desert National Park in Victoria, Australia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3086913&quot;&gt;Heath Warwick/Museums Victoria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, Schubert finds a peacock spider by looking for draglines of
silk glimmering in the sunlight. As these tiny spiders from the genus &lt;em&gt;Maratus&lt;/em&gt;
leap from leaf to leaf in search of insect prey, they extend these safety lines
behind them to catch them in case they fall. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If he’s really lucky, Schubert will catch a male spider mid-boogie,
lifting its iridescent abdomen and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPh_Gi7PCqs&quot;&gt;vigorously waggling
its legs&lt;/a&gt; in the air as it jerks back and forth in an arachnid tribute to the
moonwalk. That usually happens during the Australian springtime in about September
and October, as the males become sexually mature towards the end of their lives
and take on brightly colored forms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those wild colors inspired some interesting names. Schubert’s dubbed one
bright blue species with yellow spots &lt;em&gt;Maratus constellatus&lt;/em&gt;, because it reminded
him of Vincent Van Gogh’s painting The Starry Night. And last year, he called a
striking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.monash.edu/news/articles/new-spider-named-after-fashion-icon-karl-lagerfeld&quot;&gt;black-and-white
jumping spider&lt;/a&gt; that is a relative of peacock spiders &lt;em&gt;Jotus
karllagerfeldi&lt;/em&gt; for the late fashion icon Karl Lagerfeld.&lt;/p&gt;

Ecologist Nick Volpe provided Schubert with photographs and specimens of the spider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3086914&quot;&gt;Joseph Schubert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Schubert admits he’s had a lot of help from many Australian
photographers, amateur enthusiasts and citizen scientists who send pictures of
these miniature spiders to Schubert or share them on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/pg/projectmaratus/about/?ref=page_internal&quot;&gt;social
media&lt;/a&gt;. Without that vital help, “just a handful of us scientists would be
looking … as opposed to thousands [of enthusiasts] uploading via Facebook,”
Schubert says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He still hasn’t entirely gotten over his arachnophobia, though he’s
grateful that peacock spiders, while venomous to their tiny insect prey, are
harmless to humans. He’s handled hundreds of the spiders and suspects their
mouthparts are too small to puncture human skin, even if they wanted to take a
bite. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Less charismatic spiders are sometimes still a challenge for Schubert’s
nerves, though. In the Little Desert last year, while putting a 5-centimeter-long
wolf spider into a container, the spider pushed the lid aside and crawled up Schubert’s
arm. “I screamed,” he says, laughing. “But if I can prepare and mentally tell
myself that a spider is not looking to hurt me, and even if it does bite me,
it’s not going to do anything, then I can put myself in the mental position to
handle it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australian-fires-incinerated-habitats-threatened-species-ecological-disaster&quot;&gt;bushfires
that swept vast areas of Australia&lt;/a&gt; between September and February (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/13/20&lt;/em&gt;) could potentially have
burned through the tiny ranges of several peacock spider species found in
Victoria’s alpine regions. Nobody has yet been able to check, and future field
work is currently on hold amid the ongoing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;COVID-19
pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As soon as Schubert can get out again, he will — whether on a research
trip or on his next holiday. The only problem, he says, is that “it’s sometimes
difficult to find other people who want to spend personal time looking for
spiders.”  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2RvrdfH&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Spacfarers cover&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3086908&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041120_review_spacefarers_cover-1-123x186.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2RvrdfH&quot;&gt;Spacefarers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christopher Wanjek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harvard Univ., $29.95&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By 20th
century expectations, we are way behind schedule on colonizing the solar
system. After the Apollo moon landings, some scientists and NASA officials
envisioned launching astronauts to Mars in the 1980s and building cities in
space to be habitable by the 2000s. But the only humans in space today are a
few astronauts in a lone space station orbiting Earth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That may soon change, says science writer Christopher Wanjek. China is preparing to send crewed missions to the moon by the 2030s. SpaceX founder Elon Musk hopes to take people to the Red Planet, while Bigelow Aerospace is drawing up plans for Earth-orbiting hotels. Increasing competition for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-landed-moon-missions-apollo-top-science-stories-2019-yir&quot;&gt;geopolitical power and profits promised by space travel&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/21/19 &amp;amp; 1/4/20, p. 31&lt;/em&gt;) may finally get astronauts back to the moon and beyond, Wanjek says. In &lt;em&gt;Spacefarers&lt;/em&gt;, he explores how this 21st century space race could play out. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Drawing on the science and history of space exploration,
Wanjek paints scenes of future human activity across the solar system. “A
two-week trip to the moon [would] be much like an African safari was 150 years
ago,” he writes. “Initially for the wealthy, with a tinge of danger, and
certainly not for the kids, at least not at first.” On Mars, too far for a
weekend getaway, self-sufficient colonies could serve as a pit stop between
Earth and minable asteroids and as the frontier of the outer solar system.
Wanjek expects a permanent human presence on Mars in the 2050s and visits to
Jupiter’s moons by 2100.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Wanjek tempers these far-out ideas with frank discussions
about the perils of space travel. There are oft-cited worries, like the fact
that, as Wanjek puts it, “living in microgravity sucks.” Weightlessness weakens
bone and muscle, and Wanjek is not convinced that the International Space
Station diet and exercise regimen is enough to keep astronauts fit for the long
haul to another planet. Then there are less obvious concerns, like how a Mars
colony growing light-sensitive crops underground is supposed to restock LED
bulbs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experiments in the 1990s provide a humbling illustration of
how space missions could go awry. Inside a prototype Mars colony dubbed
Biosphere 2 in Arizona, bugs multiplied, crops failed and crew members split
into factions. After the disaster that was the first two-year mission, a second
attempt in 1994 lasted just six months before dissolving into “vandalism, foul
language, lawsuits, finger-pointing, shaming,” Wanjek writes. “You know,
typical Mars colonization kind of stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite spending much of &lt;em&gt;Spacefarers &lt;/em&gt;poking holes in space travel schemes, Wanjek is optimistic that humans will eventually need to specify a solar system body on postal addresses. “You can’t launch humans to Mars on a tank of hope,” he writes, but humans have never been closer to embarking on a voyage beyond the moon.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you often spend time with your friends in order to forget about personal problems? Do you think about your friends even when you’re not with them? Have you even gone as far as ignoring your family to spend time with your friends?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you answered yes to these questions, you might fit the criteria for “offline friend addiction”, according to a new scale &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/7x85m/&quot;&gt;described in a preprint&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;PsyArxiv. &lt;/em&gt;Except, of course, that this notion is ridiculous. How can we be addicted to socialising, the fulfilment of one of our basic human needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s pretty much the point of the new paper, written with tongue firmly in cheek. But behind it is a serious argument: although a scale for offline friend addiction is clearly absurd, there’s another, similar concept for which such scales have already been developed — social media addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39471&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Some psychologists have expressed concern that social media is damaging our mental health or that we’ve become dependent on it, and as much as a third of the population can be classified as “addicted” using measures of social media addiction. But many aspects of social media fulfil our need to connect with others. So could people actually be addicted to socialising more generally, even when that occurs offline?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this not-entirely-serious question, Liam Satchell from the University of Winchester and colleagues developed the Offline-Friend Addiction Questionnaire, or O-FAQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team created the scale by mimicking the process used to develop measures of social media addiction. Many of these were adapted from scales for other problems such as alcohol craving, replacing references to alcohol with references to social media. So the team decided to adapt these social media addiction scales in the same way: for instance, instead of respondents indicating if they “spent more time on Facebook than initially intended”, they were asked if they had “spent more time with friends than I initially intended”. The team ended up with a 37-item questionnaire, which 807 participants completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, researchers have attempted to prove that social media addiction scales are valid by showing that they are associated with related measures, such as scales of problematic behaviour. So again, the authors did the same thing, “validating” the O-FAQ by demonstrating that participants’ scores were associated with risk-taking behaviour and certain personality traits. Some participants also completed the questionnaire again 28 days later, allowing the team to show that participants responded consistently across time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, to figure out how many people were friend addicts, the team again used criteria from past work, in which a person is considered “addicted” if they score at the midpoint or above on more than half of the questions. This revealed that 69% of respondents were addicted to their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we be worried about this apparent friendship addiction crisis? Obviously not, say the researchers. “’Offline friend addiction’ is not an issue of concern for public health, but rather it is capturing experiences pertinent to social support, adaptation, and well-being across the lifespan,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the point is that measures of social media addiction &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;capture these experiences. We might use social media to give or receive emotional support, for instance, or to hang out with our friends after a long day. Yet these scales don’t take this context into account. “What we have demonstrated here is that researchers can quickly produce farcical results when conceptualising social media as a distinctive entity that is unrelated to any other social context,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work also highlights how easy — and potentially problematic — it is to claim that a scale is valid and use it to diagnose people when there aren’t actually any recognised diagnostic criteria to compare it against. Neither offline friend addiction nor social media addiction are formal psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, in the current crisis the paper has taken on new relevance. Right now we are unable to see our “offline friends”, and for many of us the internet is the main means of communication. So perhaps, as psychologist Amy Orben &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/26/how-psychology-researchers-are-responding-to-the-covid-19-pandemic/&quot;&gt;suggested to us&lt;/a&gt; last month, we will begin to see the emergence of a more nuanced conversation about the benefits and risks of social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the team are not the first to develop a tongue-in-cheek measure to make a point about technology use. The term “Internet Addiction Disorder” was reportedly first coined in 1995 by psychiatrist Ivan Goldberg, who posted satirical diagnostic criteria for the new “disorder” to a psychology bulletin board. “To medicalize every behavior by putting it into psychiatric nomenclature is ridiculous”, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/01/13/just-click-no&quot;&gt;Goldberg told the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; back in 1997. More than 20 years later, the authors of the new study conclude with a similar message: “We urge future social media research to focus on testing what components of social media use are distinct to offline social information seeking, especially when attempting to pathologise everyday behaviour.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Thanks to Kevin Bacon, everybody nowadays knows about
networks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are not only Bacon-like networks of actors, linked by
appearing in the same film, but also social networks, neural networks and
networks of viral transmission. There are power grid networks, ecological
networks and the grandest network of all, the internet. Sometimes it seems like
the entire universe must be just one big network.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And maybe it is.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Physicist–computer scientist–entrepreneur Stephen Wolfram
believes the universe is a vast, growing network of relationships that
constitutes space itself, and everything within it. In this picture, Wolfram
sees the basis for the ultimate theory underlying all of physical law.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Wolfram expressed something like this view 18 years ago in a
1,197-page tome entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A
New Kind of Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But back then his picture was still a
little fuzzy. Now he thinks he has found a more sharply focused vision for how
to explain reality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m thrilled to say,” he writes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful&quot;&gt;in a &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful&quot;&gt;summary &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful&quot;&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; released April 14, “that I think we’ve found a path to the fundamental theory of physics.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the core of Wolfram’s approach is the notion of a
hypergraph. “Graph” in this context is like the diagrammatic representation of
a network: lines connecting points. But reality can’t be captured by lines
linking points on a flat sheet of paper. Wolfram generates computer visualizations
to depict relationships in more complicated “hypergraphs.” (In a hypergraph,
the “lines” can connect any number of points, not just one to another.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wolfram’s
investigations indicate that complex hypergraphs can mimic many features of the
universe, including matter and energy, along with reproducing the physical
structures and processes described by the theory of relativity and quantum
mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In our model,
everything in the universe — space, matter, whatever — is supposed to be
represented by features of our evolving hypergraph,” Wolfram writes.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;His key point is that such extremely complex hypergraphs can
be produced by applying simple rules to a simple starting point. Suppose you
have two “abstract elements” labeled A and B. You have a rule that says every A
should be changed to BBB, and every BB should be replaced with A.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Start with A. By the rule, you “update” A to BBB. BBB
possesses two BBs. So you update BBB twice: Once, making the first two Bs into an
A (making AB), and then making the second two Bs to an A, making BA. So:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;is connected to &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BBB&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;which is connected to both &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AB and BA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Updates of AB and BA both yield BBBB. But BBBB then makes
ABB, BBA and BAB. As you keep on applying the rule, the graph gets more complicated.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These update steps, Wolfram says, correspond to our common
notion of time, a sort of ticktock of the cosmic clock. As a rule is repeatedly
applied to a set of abstract entities, the resulting connections — the graph of
the relationships linking them — correspond to the structure of space. So space
(in this picture) is not a mere uniform set of indistinguishable points; rather
it is a network of points linked in unfathomably complex patterns that
reproduce matter and energy and the relationships collectively known as the
laws of physics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is basically
how I think space in the universe works,” Wolfram writes. “Underneath, it’s a
bunch of discrete, abstract relations between abstract points. But at the scale
we’re experiencing it, the pattern of relations it has makes it seem like
continuous space of the kind we’re used to.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s sort of like how
fish perceive the ocean as a smooth featureless fluid, even though the water is
made of discrete tiny molecules.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a sense, Wolfram
believes, everything that exists is basically made from space. “Put another
way,” he writes, “it’s the exact same hypergraph that’s giving us the structure
of space, and everything that exists in space.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It almost sounds like theoretical physicists should close up
shop and just run some computer simulations using Wolfram’s rules. But as he
acknowledges, the job isn’t done yet. So far Wolfram’s project has identified
almost 1,000 rules that produce complicated structures that look like &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;
universe. It remains to be seen what rule produces precisely the universe we
all actually inhabit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sometime — I hope
soon — there might just be a rule … that has all the right properties, and that
we’ll slowly discover that, yes, this is it — our universe finally decoded,”
Wolfram writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his summary, Wolfram declares that hypergraphs illustrate
a principle he calls “causal invariance.” That means that various distinct paths
through the hypergraph can sometimes converge. Such convergences allow the cause-and-effect
chain of events through time to be preserved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a hypergraph
“there is not just one path of time; there are many paths, and many
‘histories,’” Wolfram writes. But one supposedly independent path of history
can merge with another. “Even when the paths of history that are followed are
different, these causal relationships can end up being the same — and that in
effect, to an observer embedded in the system, there is still just a single
thread of time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks to causal invariance, Wolfram’s hypergraphs reproduce
many of the consequences of various physical theories, such as Einstein’s
special theory of relativity. Traveling rapidly slows down time (as special
relativity says) because hypergraph structures corresponding to moving objects make
an angle through the hypergraph that extends the distance between updates (or
time steps). The speed of light is a maximum velocity, as relativity states,
because it represents the maximum rate that information can spread through the
hypergraph as it updates. And gravity — described by Einstein’s general theory
of relativity — emerges in the relationship between features in the hypergraph
that can be interpreted as matter particles. (Particles would be small sets of
linked points that persist as the hypergraph updates, something like “little
lumps of space” with special properties.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an even more
complicated extension of these ideas, Wolfram explores how hypergraph
properties even correspond to the weird features of quantum mechanics. “In our
models, quantum mechanics is not just possible; it’s absolutely inevitable,”
Wolfram asserts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Space as constructed in such hypergraphs can have a very
fine structure, like a digital camera sensor with gazillions of megapixels. Wolfram
estimates that a hypergraph corresponding to today’s universe might have applied
10&lt;sup&gt;500 &lt;/sup&gt;time steps (incomprehensibly more than the universe’s age in
seconds, roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;). So space could be fine-grained enough to contain
matter-particle structures much, much smaller than the known particles of physics.
In fact, Wolfram suggests, supersmall unknown particles, which he calls
oligons, might have been created in abundance shortly after the beginning of
the universe. Such oligons, subject only to gravity, could now be hanging out
in and around galaxies utterly unnoticed — except for their gravitational impact.
Oligons might therefore explain why astronomers infer the existence of vast amounts
of invisible “dark matter” in space. (And that could also explain why attempts so
far to identify the nature of dark matter have been unsuccessful.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the mysterious “dark energy” that drives the
universe to expand at an accelerating rate might just be a natural feature of
Wolfram’s hypergraphs. Perhaps dark energy might in essence just be what space
itself is made of. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, Wolfram believes that his hypergraphs could
resolve current disputes about which of many speculative theories are the best
bets for explaining fundamental physics. Superstring theory, loop quantum
gravity, causal sets and other ideas have all been proposed, and debated, for
decades. Wolfram thinks hypergraphs can contain all of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It almost seems like
everyone has been right all along,” he writes, “and it just takes adding a new substrate
to see how it all fits together.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wolfram’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction&quot;&gt;technical
paper&lt;/a&gt; (and accompanying papers — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/wolframphysics/Documents/some-relativistic-and-gravitational-properties-of-the-wolfram-model.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/wolframphysics/Documents/some-quantum-mechanical-properties-of-the-wolfram-model.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; —
by colleague Jonathan Gorard) have been posted on a website promoting his
project, and Wolfram is inviting the physics community to participate in
pursuing his vision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the end our goal must be to build a bridge that connects our models to existing knowledge about physics,” he writes. “I am extremely optimistic that we are finally on the right track” toward finding the “right” rule for our universe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That “right rule” would generate a hypergraph with our
universe’s precise properties: three (apparent) dimensions of space, the right cosmic
expansion rate, the right repertoire of elementary particles with the correct
charges and masses, and other features. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But perhaps, Wolfram
has realized, seeking one single rule misses a bigger point. Maybe the universe
uses all the possible rules. Then all the possible universes are just parts of
one really big universe, in which “absolutely everything … can happen — including
all events for all possible rules.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We discern a certain
set of physical laws based on the “language” we use to describe and comprehend
the world. The elements of this language are tuned to “the kinds of things our
senses detect, our measuring devices measure, and our existing physics
describes.” The right rule is the one that corresponds to the portion of the
hypergraph that we explore from our own particular frame of reference. Life
elsewhere might see things differently. “There’s actually an almost infinite
diversity of different ways to describe and experience our universe,” Wolfram
suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words,
explaining the physics that applies to our existence might require insight into
the mechanisms of a vastly more complex reality, beyond the realm of what we
can experience. As Wolfram puts it, “In many ways, we are inevitably skating at
the edge of what humans can understand.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As he acknowledges, much more work will be needed to merge his
approach with the successful theories of established physics. And standard
physics does have an impressive resume of accomplishments, explaining details
about everything from the innards of atoms to the architecture of the universe
and the nature of space and time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet mainstream physicists have long suspected that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/out-fabric&quot;&gt;space and time cannot
be fundamental&lt;/a&gt; concepts. Rather it seems likely that space and time are
conventions that must emerge from something deeper. It might be a long shot,
but just maybe Wolfram has perceived a path that leads to the depths where
reality originates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only time — or many more hypergraph updating steps — will
tell.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;It’s not every day an element gets added to the periodic
table. The last time it happened was 2016, when&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/names-four-new-elements-get-seal-approval&quot;&gt;
four new elements became official&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For these elements, reaching the table was an epic quest spanning
more than a decade. It required rare radioactive ingredients, violent atom
smashing, painstaking detection, a mountain of paperwork and a fair amount of waiting
before the elements became undisputed champions. But in the end, the newcomers made
it into the canon that governs chemistry, filling out the periodic table’s
seventh row. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, scientists continue &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-periodic-table-future-superheavy-elements&quot;&gt;pushing
the table to its limits&lt;/a&gt;, as they hunt for the next elements. It’s too soon
to say when element 119 or 120 might enter the spotlight. But the International
Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and the International Union of Pure and
Applied Physics (IUPAC and IUPAP), which evaluate new element claims, have set
out key steps and guidelines for becoming an element. So we know a thing or two
about what it will take. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Follow the journey in the video below. It may be a long and arduous process, but when you break it down, getting a spot on the periodic table has all the excitement and drama of a reality TV singing competition. &lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cold-war-nuclear-test-residue-offers-clue-whale-shark-ages"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3086955</id>
		<updated>2020-04-14T10:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Radioactive
residue from Cold War nuclear tests has given scientists a cipher to decode the
ages of whale sharks, written on the animals’ vertebrae. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whale
sharks (&lt;em&gt;Rhincodon typus&lt;/em&gt;) accumulate alternating stripes of opaque and
translucent tissue on their vertebrae as they age, similar to the way tree
trunks grow rings. But until now, scientists haven’t known whether whale shark
vertebrae gain a new growth band each year or every six months — making it
difficult to gauge just how fast these sharks grow or how long they live. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New
measurements of carbon-14 in the vertebrae of two whale sharks that lived
during the 20th century suggest that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00188/full&quot;&gt;growth bands form annually&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report in the April 2020
&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Marine Science&lt;/em&gt;. Soviet and American nuclear weapons tests
in the 1950s and 1960s produced that carbon-14, which built up in Earth’s
atmosphere and oceans. By matching the amount of carbon-14 in different
vertebral growth bands with the known carbon-14 levels in surface seawater in
different years, the researchers estimated when each band formed — and found
that subsequent bands generally grew a year apart. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The total
number of growth bands in each dated vertebra indicated that one whale shark, a
10-meter male found in Taiwan, was about 35 years old when it died. The other
shark, a female of about the same size collected in Pakistan, was around 50
years old. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“It is
really, really likely that there are older whale sharks out there, simply
because we know there are much larger whale sharks,” says Steven Campana, a
fisheries scientist at the University of Iceland in Reykjavík. Whale sharks are
known to grow up to about 18 meters long. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Campana
and colleagues used vertebral growth-band counts to figure out the ages of 18 additional
dead whale sharks, which ranged from 15 to 25 years old. Those sharks measured
2.7 to almost 6 meters in length. Based on the lengths of sharks of different
ages, the researchers estimated that young whale sharks grow about 20
centimeters per year, on average. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Whale shark vertebrae&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3086954&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041320_mt_whaleshark_inline1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3086954&quot;&gt;Whale shark vertebrae rack up growth bands as the shark ages (the alternating opaque and translucent stripes seen in this slice of a vertebra, each marked with a black dot). These growth bands, now estimated to form annually, can be used to decipher a whale shark’s age. This whale shark, found in Taiwan, lived about 18 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3086954&quot;&gt;J.J.L. Ong &lt;em&gt;et al/Frontiers in Marine Science&lt;/em&gt; 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Information
on the life spans and growth rates of whale sharks could inform conservation
strategies to protect &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/19488/2365291&quot;&gt;this endangered species&lt;/a&gt;, Campana says. “Long-lived animals
like whale sharks almost certainly become mature at a relatively old age, and
their populations are relatively slow to increase their numbers.” So whale
shark populations may not bounce back from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/discover-fish/species-profiles/rhincodon-typus/&quot;&gt;threats like overfishing&lt;/a&gt; as quickly as species with shorter
life cycles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fisheries
biologist Allen Andrews cautions that there is some uncertainty in the
carbon-14 dating technique that Campana’s team used, because radioactive carbon
from nuclear tests did not spread evenly throughout Earth’s oceans. What’s
more, “young [whale] sharks disappear for a big portion of their lives,” says
Andrews, of the University of Hawaii at Manoa. If young whale sharks spend much
of their time deep underwater, they may not receive the same dose of carbon-14
as measured at the ocean’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers
could further investigate whale shark growth by tagging live sharks and then recapturing
them, measuring how much the animals grew in the interim, Andrews says. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jessesingal.com/&quot;&gt;Jesse Singal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important and durable findings in moral and political psychology is that there is a tail-wags-the-dog aspect to human morality. Most of us like to think we have carefully thought-through, coherent moral systems that guide our behaviour and judgements. In reality our behaviour and judgements often stem from gut-level impulses, and only after the fact do we build elaborate moral rationales to justify what we believe and do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-23351-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; examines this issue through a fascinating lens: free will. Or, more specifically, via people’s judgments about how much free will others had when committing various transgressions. The team, led by Jim A. C. Everett of the University of Kent and Cory J. Clark of Durham University, ran 14 studies geared at evaluating the possibility that at least some of the time the moral tail wags the dog: first people decide whether someone is blameworthy, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; judge how much free will they have, in a way that allows them to justify blaming those they want to blame and excusing those they want to excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39454&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The researchers examined this hypothesis, for which there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660989&quot;&gt;already some evidence&lt;/a&gt;, through the lens of American partisan politics. In the paper they note that previous research has shown that conservatives have a greater belief in free will than liberals, and are more moralising in general (that is, they categorise a larger number of acts as morally problematic, and rely on a greater number of principles — or moral foundations — in making these judgements). The first two of the new studies replicated these findings — this is consistent with the idea, put simply, that conservatives believe in free will more because it allows them to level more moral judgements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to unpack in the remaining studies, but here are a few of the key findings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Study 4&lt;/strong&gt;, the researchers found that when it came to attribution of free will in instances that were viewed as “equally immoral for liberals and conservatives,” (such as spreading malicious rumours about a co-worker) there was no longer any correlation between participants’ political stance (liberal vs. conservative) and their evaluations of how much free will the transgressor had. This lends support to the idea that “differences in conservatives’ and liberals’ perception of free will may be partially due to differences in moralisation, rather than representing any generalised, abstract belief that human behaviours are freely chosen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Study 5&lt;/strong&gt;, the researchers found that when they deliberately presented participants with hypothetical acts designed to be viewed as more immoral by liberals — such as “Robert sends a formal complaint to his child’s school after finding that his child’s kindergarten teacher is transgendered” — the normal pattern reversed itself, and it was now liberals who attributed more free will to the actors in question. (This finding was weaker, and only statistically significant when the researchers bumped up their sample beyond its initial size.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Study 7&lt;/strong&gt;, the researchers synthesised the aforementioned findings and randomly assigned online participants recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to situations in which the person committing a bad act was either described as liberal or conservative and as acting in order to achieve liberal or conservative goals. After confirming  that the MTurk respondents viewed moral harms against their own political group more harshly, the researchers also found “tentative — but weak — evidence” in favour of their overall hypothesis: liberal MTurkers viewed conservative bad actors as having more free will than bad-acting liberals, and conservative MTurkers viewed liberal bad actors  as having more free will than bad-acting conservatives. In short, when people take political actions that we morally disapprove of, we’re more inclined to believe they did it of their own volition. This bias afflicts conservatives more often, because they’re more morally disapproving, but can just as easily afflict liberals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the evidence is mixed, but overall the paper suggests that even judgments about free will (a complex philosophical concept that has been the subject of much debate and introspection) can’t escape the gut-impulse nature that underlies so much human moralising. Though preliminary, this is an important finding that could have ramifications for society. For one thing, if we have a tendency to view agents as more free when their bad acts offend us politically, but as less free when they don’t, that’s the sort of psychological tendency that could be echoed in law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-23351-001&quot;&gt;Political differences in free will belief are associated with differences in moralization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h4&gt;How to spot a neuroscientist in the wild&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MYbi9HRLcuUFVT_ivl83nQ.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Neuroethologist in the wild. Image credit: Pixabay&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We here report the discovery of a new species of the genus Homo, for which we propose the binomial &lt;em&gt;Homo Neuroscientus&lt;/em&gt;. Despite dating their last common ancestor with &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; to within a mere hundred years ago, the evolutionary pressure of being forced to reckon with the most complex organ in known existence has driven rapid divergence in &lt;em&gt;Neuroscientus&lt;/em&gt;. This has given rise to an absurdly overextended obsession with the brain, while atrophying other, normal features of the genus Homo. Indeed, in our field studies we found the sense of social etiquette to be vestigial at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over two decades of close observation we have identified a number of sub-species. While we believe these sub-species to be technically capable of interbreeding, they are rarely seen interacting in the wild, and so must be considered distinct. Here we present a field guide to identifying these sub-species from their characteristics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Mimics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of species that attempt to mimic &lt;em&gt;Homo Neuroscientus&lt;/em&gt;, but are easily distinguished upon close observation. Two in particular are noteworthy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurobollocker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sapiens that append the suffix “neuro-” to any random noun to make it sound smart and brain-y. Particularly egregious examples include neuro-marketing, neuro-law, and neuro-criticism. Frequently confuse neuroscience with psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cranks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sub-species of Sapiens easily identified by their mantra “I’ve got a theory for how the whole brain works”. Scourge of inboxes. Somehow oblivious that the collective efforts of the highly intelligent few hundred thousand members of the below &lt;em&gt;Homo Neuroscientus&lt;/em&gt; sub-species have been ultimately aimed at that very same thing, across all scales at which brains work, for about a hundred years — yet have not constructed a working theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Sub-species&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Electrophysiologist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recorder of single neurons, lowerer of electrodes. Notable tribes include the patch-clampers, whose cruel initiation rites require attaching a micrometer-scale piece of glass to the body of a neuron ten times smaller than the thickness of a human hair. Some among this tribe, possibly insane, attempt the same in awake, moving animals. They are easily distinguished from other &lt;em&gt;Neuroscientus&lt;/em&gt; by the rhythmic beating of their heads against the lab bench when losing yet another neuron after just three trials of behaviour are complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Systems Neuroscientist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distinguishable from the electrophysiologist by trying to record from many neurons at the same time, and relate them to something in the outside world. Comes in many tribes, from the sensory obsessives, the memorists and decisionists, to the motor wagglers, through others that identify themselves by blobs of the brain — the corticians, cerebellites, the basal gang, the hippocampites, the amygdalarians — to yet others that identify with the type of brain — the worm-wranglers, the fly-fanciers, the sea-sluggers. To the naive observer these tribes would all seem to be working towards the same goal, but vicious internecine wars frequently erupt within and between tribes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insufferably smug since members of their subspecies were awarded a Nobel Prize in 2014 (“we’re a real science now”), they are nonetheless handicapped by the crudeness of their tools, which has led to the Humphries Uncertainty Principle: they can either record precisely when neurons send spikes but not know exactly where they are, or know precisely where they are but not know exactly when they send spikes (they call these “multi-electrode recording” and “calcium imaging”, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cognitive Neuroscientist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subspecies is more intensely interested in us Sapiens than any other. We find it useful to distinguish a number of breeds, albeit with some overlap:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroimager — often referred to by other subspecies as “a psychologist with a magnet”, they adore rainbow colours. A deeply superstitious people, yet highly intelligent. In their writings frequent references are made to “Bonferroni”, possibly a deity, and they will cross themselves and mutter curses to the heavens upon hearing the phrase “dead salmon”. But the complex incantations necessary to turn the magnetic alignment of oxygen-depleted haemoglobin into a measurable signal of brain activity is testament to their ingenuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scalp tickler — a “psychologist with a hairnet”, readily identified by their distinctive calls. Anthropologists have transcribed some of these calls (lit. “P100”, “N2”), but have yet to discern their meaning. Some authorities subdivide a further breed, the Magnetiser, a psychologist with a quantum thingy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Paddlers — believe that waving a magic wand near the scalp of a Sapiens will variously cause involuntary movement, enhance their mathematical ability, or let them experience the presence of god(s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Neuroanatomist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was thought to be going extinct, until the Connectomics Explosion approximately 15YA rapidly diversified the gene pool, with many new, previously unrecorded phenotypes appearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider the brain to be a feedback loop. Fiddles with amplifier settings until the squealing stops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioural Neuroscientist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attempts to infer the workings of the brain from watching a rodent press a lever. Talks almost entirely in capital letters (example transcript: “the US will become the CS, but leave the UR intact”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroethologist &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attempts to infer the workings of the brain from watching an animal go about its daily routine. Barely on speaking terms with Behavioural Neuroscientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroendocrinologist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slightly hormonal. Obsessed with how everything sloshing around the brain that isn’t a neurotransmitter affects brain cells. Believes a “raster plot” is a graph drawn by a Bob Marley fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Molecular neuroscientist &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applies the tools of close cousins the molecular biologist to the brain. Loves the stuff floating inside cells, especially proteins and complex chains of chemicals signalling to each other. Unable to distinguish the brain from the liver without assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurogeneticist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obsessed with the expression of bits of DNA and RNA in brain cells. Unable to distinguish the brain from yeast without assistance.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Neuroscientist &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haughty and proud, these interact the most with Homo sapiens, bringing their skills to treat the damaged and sick among that closely-related species. Males of this sub-species are thought to be born wearing a suit and tie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computational Neuroscientist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often gaunt, frequently shunning daylight, these shy creatures have also a number of distinctive breeds. Recent gene sequencing work on this sub-species has revealed evidence of lateral gene transfer from known species of Physicists, Mathematicians, and Computer Scientists. The consequent melange of languages spoken among members of this sub-species often collapses interactions into mutual bafflement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circuit modeller — Literal-minded to a fault, these build exact scale models of bits of brain. Often try to show them to their fellow Systems Neuroscientists working on the same bit of brain, but suffer frequent barbs and social rejection (“Suited for a more specialist journal”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Algorithmics — Seek the Holy Grail of the step-by-step instructions by which the brain works. Once discovered that deep-lying neurons, which may or may not contain dopamine, send a signal that looked like the difference: [actual value of what happened] — [predicted value of what happened]. Have been banging on about it for the past 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compartmentalist — Uses a thousand equations to describe a single neuron, none of whose parameters are experimentally determined. Often found weeping silently into a drink at conference bars. Worship at the Church of Rall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bayesians — Have discovered a hammer, and are determined to use it on absolutely bloody anything that’s not already nailed down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karl Friston&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unclassifiable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want more?

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oumuamua-broken-planet-fragment-comet-asteroid"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3086941</id>
		<updated>2020-04-13T15:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The solar system’s first recorded interstellar visitor has a
new proposed origin story. The enigmatic celestial object known as ‘Oumuamua might
be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1065-8&quot;&gt;a shard of a
planet ripped apart by its star’s gravity&lt;/a&gt;, researchers suggest April 13 in &lt;em&gt;Nature
Astronomy&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ever since ‘Oumuamua showed up in our solar system in 2017, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/explanations-oumuamua-not-alien-spaceships&quot;&gt;astronomers
have struggled to explain its origin&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that it might be a wayward
asteroid, a comet or even an alien spacecraft (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/27/19&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Searching for other explanations, astronomers Yun Zhang at Côte
d’Azur Observatory in Nice, France and Douglas Lin at the University of
California, Santa Cruz developed computer simulations in which planetary bodies
got too close to their parent stars. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In these simulations, objects ranging in size from comets to
rocky planets orbit relatively lightweight stars. The scientists found that if
these bodies repeatedly come within about 600,000 kilometers of their star —
nearly 80 times as close as Mercury gets to our sun — then the star’s gravity
shreds the objects, and flings the fragments into interstellar space.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;If ‘Oumuamua were such a fragment, that might explain its
odd shape, its tumbling motion and why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/oumuamua-may-be-comet-not-asteroid&quot;&gt;it
sped up as it left the solar system&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/27/18&lt;/em&gt;). The simulated
planetary shards tumble and tend to be cigar-shaped, similar to ‘Oumuamua. And such
a fragment could retain water ice deep within, the researchers say. Buried ice could
have produced water vapor as ‘Oumuamua got heated by our sun. If that gas
escaped through porous rock, it could have acted as a natural rocket, giving
our fleeting visitor a little nudge as it rounded the sun. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This origin story is a plausible one that links ‘Oumuamua’s
strange properties to planet formation throughout the galaxy, says Gregory
Laughlin, an astronomer at Yale University who was not involved with this study.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb sees a plot hole in
that narrative. To account for the estimated number of ‘Oumuamua-like objects
that must be whizzing around the galaxy, “one needs each star to produce
roughly a quadrillion such objects.” But planetary shredding should instead be
rare, requiring the bodies to pass through a tiny sliver of space around a star,
he says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that’s assuming a doomed object doesn’t just evaporate rather than break apart. “The statistics of such events makes the proposed scenario unlikely,” Loeb says.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We are so proud and honored to serve the arXiv community who, despite the global turmoil caused by the COVID-19 crisis, are more committed than ever to advancing scientific research. At arXiv our commitment to improving the platform with changes large and small continues as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently held a survey to assess new incremental updates to the mobile-friendly display of the abstract page. First of all, we want to extend a huge &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;thank you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to all of the survey participants. Participation levels were high and we really value your time and your insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our survey we asked participants to review the proposed abstract page on their mobile device and then rate its usability against the current live page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Survey comparison of the old and new layouts&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-596 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/04/abs-options-web-1024x917.jpg&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the main changes include reducing the height of the header, adding mobile-friendly navigation and search links, and moving the download button. We also made the citations section (not shown in the screenshots above) more user friendly on touch screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users overwhelmingly found the proposed abstract page style improved their experience on mobile devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, I prefer the new style: &lt;strong&gt;94.81% &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No, I prefer the old style: &lt;strong&gt;5.19%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-597 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/04/abs-barchart-web.jpg&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users also provided valuable feedback on other aspects of the UI which we are cataloging to inform future updates. We will push these mobile-friendly edits to the live site this week, so if you access arXiv on your phone you’ll notice some changes on the abstract page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for helping us improve arXiv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-The arXiv NG team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want to join our next user testing survey? From time to time arXiv sends out surveys, previews to new changes, and other testing opportunities to interested users. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/user-testing&quot;&gt;To join our user testing group sign up here&lt;/a&gt;. User testing is integral to arXiv’s development process and we welcome your feedback.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hala Nelson and her colleagues wanted to
cook the perfect steak. So they decided to use math.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers created &lt;a href=&quot;https://epjplus.epj.org/articles/epjplus/abs/2020/03/13360_2020_Article_311/13360_2020_Article_311.html&quot;&gt;a mathematical simulation of a lean slab of beef roasting&lt;/a&gt; in an oven. That simulation successfully reproduced
the temperatures and moisture levels seen within meat in laboratory experiments
previously performed by food scientists, the team reports March 23 in &lt;em&gt;European Physical Journal Plus&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the simulation, the steak consists of
a two-dimensional network of proteins filled with fluid. Mathematical equations
determine what happens as the simulated meat cooks. For example, the proteins
are deformed, water evaporates, and the steak shrinks. The exterior of the
steak dries out, while liquid moves toward the center, making the interior nice
and juicy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on how well-done you prefer your steak, and how moist you want it inside, you can use the results of the study to determine how to cook it to perfection, says Nelson, an applied mathematician at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va. But she hasn’t changed her cooking technique: “I still make my husband cook the steak.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seabirds-may-find-food-sea-flying-massive-kilometers-wide-arc"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Food
is scattered thinly in the open ocean, and seabirds often need to search far
and wide to find sustenance. Now, researchers think they’ve found a new cooperative
strategy among the birds, one that may help them survive on the high seas.
Multiple groups of flying seabirds can arrange themselves into massive line
formations that “rake” over the ocean’s surface, possibly to more efficiently
search for food. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Far
from land, the ocean can be unforgiving, but seabirds have a remarkable suite
of adaptations for finding food in this blue desert. For example, seabirds can
work together when foraging on a chance school of fish, boosting catch rates by
synchronizing their diving. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But
the shape and scale of the cooperative “rake” formations — with &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1111/jav.02258&quot;&gt;multiple bird groups stretching kilometers
across&lt;/a&gt; the sky — have never
before been scientifically observed in seabirds, researchers report March 23 in
the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Avian Biology&lt;/em&gt;.“To our knowledge, no such flight pattern … had ever been observed
and described,” says Camille Assali, an animal ecologist at the Marine
Biodiversity Exploitation and Conservation research unit in Sète, France.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To
track the birds’ movements, Assali and colleagues looked at a year’s worth of
radar images from a tuna fishing boat hundreds of kilometers off of Africa’s coastline,
near the Gulf of Guinea. Fishing boats use radar to find seabirds, which can
hint at the whereabouts of roiling fish activity. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Analyzing
the radar images for movement patterns in groups of seabirds, the scientists found
that multiple groups would fly in a parallel sweep as often as 19 times a day.
The birds also seemed to be adjusting their speed and position relative to one
another so that they formed an evenly spaced line over the top of the ocean.
Some of these formations, with groups spaced half a kilometer apart and
reaching four kilometers across, would last nearly 20 minutes before collapsing
or merging together. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Assali
thinks the raking patterns likely result from behavioral coordination between
groups of seabirds maintained by keeping track of each other by sight, rather
than being caused by environmental factors such as headwinds or the angle of
the sun. Neither of those factors seemed to have an effect on the movements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The
birds may be using rake formations to scan for signs of food, the researchers
say. By distributing themselves in a line, the birds may avoid missing sections
of ocean surface or searching the same area twice. But more research is needed
to confirm any link to foraging, Assali says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We
would need to measure the foraging success of raking versus nonraking birds and
highlight potential costs and benefits of these different foraging strategies,”
she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s
also not yet known which bird species, or how many, are involved in these
flight patterns. Assali says the best candidates are sooty terns (&lt;em&gt;Onychoprion
fuscatus&lt;/em&gt;) or noddies (&lt;em&gt;Anous &lt;/em&gt;spp.). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And
more field observations, or even video footage taken with a portable camera
from inside the formations themselves, could help scientists figure out why the
birds form rake patterns in the first place, Assali says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sasha Dall,
a mathematical ecologist at the University of Exeter in Cornwall, England, says
that if these seabird rakes are some kind of coordinated, prey-finding method,
it’s “something that I haven’t really heard anybody document before.” Dall
points out that research showing rake formations collapsing around a source of prey
would help establish the link between the flight patterns and food
finding. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The
uniform nature of open water may also lend itself to this search strategy, which
could also help the seabirds spot other birds and animals hunting fish, Dall says.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whatever the rakes are for, it’s clear they’ve already uncovered a trove of new questions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Nearly 20 years of war following the events of September 11 has resulted in advances in military psychology that stand to improve the well-being of all people, military and civilian alike. The symbiotic relationship between psychology and the military traces back to World War I. With the advent of US involvement in the war, the army and navy had to select and train hundreds of thousands of new soldiers and sailors for increasingly technical jobs. Compared to nineteenth-century wars, World War I required military personnel to operate far more advanced and complicated equipment including aircraft, tanks, and communications systems. To match military personnel to jobs in which they would excel, the military turned to psychologists to develop new aptitude tests rapidly. The tests developed for the military vastly improved the reliability and validity of aptitude testing. Such testing became common in civilian institutions after the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, World War II stimulated psychologists to conduct further research on how to diagnose and treat combat stress and psychological injuries of war. With millions of Americans having served in the war, this knowledge provided a significant boost to clinical psychology. World War II also created a new area of psychology, human factors engineering. Engineers needed psychologists to help them understand the limits of human perceptual and cognitive capabilities in order to design ever more complex weapons and communications systems. The Vietnam War saw the emergence of the understanding of posttraumatic stress disorder, first studied among soldiers and veterans, but soon recognized to be a risk for anyone exposed to severe trauma. Our current understanding of PTSD, its causes, and how to treat it are due in no small measure to the efforts of military psychologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same manner, the war on terrorism has resulted in a renewed effort by military psychologists to better understand factors that enable military personnel to perform at their best, as well as to better understand suboptimal adjustment or pathology. This emerging research promises benefits to civilians as well. A great example is the military’s research on character and its links to individual and team performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive character traits like integrity, determination, and courage have long been identified as essential attributes of military personnel. The emergence of positive psychology in the late 1990s provided a new science-focused perspective on character among military personnel. The results of almost 20 years of research are now providing a clearer picture of the role of positive character in leading others in dangerous contexts. For example, trust — an essential element in leadership in any domain — is heavily dependent on the character traits of integrity, caring for others, and moral courage. Both research and practical leadership experience demonstrate the critical role of character in trust and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cadets at the nation’s service academies live under an honor code that dictates they will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do. Military affiliation trumps nationality when it comes to the ranking of top character strengths. In comparing US military academy cadets with Royal Norwegian Naval Academy cadets and US civilian college students, military psychologists discovered that US cadets were more similar to their Norwegian cadet counterparts than they were to US civilian college students. The strongest character attributes among the military cadets regardless of nationality were honesty, hope, bravery, persistence, and teamwork. For the US civilian college students, the highest strengths were kindness, sense of humor, honesty, and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Army researchers have discovered strong links between individual character and personal adjustment and have developed a program to enhance positive character among its soldiers. Military psychologists have found that positive character traits such as hope and optimism, persistence, self-regulation, social intelligence, and leadership contribute to the emotional and social sense of well-being, and to a sense of meaning and purpose in life. Soldiers high in these and related character strengths are less vulnerable to combat stress, perform better at their jobs, and are more likely to remain in the military compared to those low in these strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on character provides just one of many intriguing examples of how military psychology continues to contribute to our knowledge of general psychology. After all, the challenges and stresses that military personnel face are far too easily found in other walks of life. Military research on both positive individual and organizational character have significant implications for how to optimize individual and team performance in law enforcement agencies, sports teams, schools, and in corporations. Thus, the efforts of military psychologists continue to provide insights into human behavior that stand to help us all to perform at our best and to live our lives to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featured photo by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@mentorofficial?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Vladislav Nikonov&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/s/photos/military?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-importance-of-character-during-war/&quot;&gt;The importance of character during war&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/621459582/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/621459582/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/621459582/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/why-we-like-a-good-robot-story-2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why we like a good robot story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/its-time-for-the-government-to-introduce-food-rationing/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;It’s time for the government to introduce food rationing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/protecting-workers-from-covid-19/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Protecting workers from COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;A new water pollution control bill that provides clear assignments of liability without proof of negligence to the source of an oil spill was signed into law by President [Richard] Nixon last week…. It would add pesticide levels to the factors involved in formulating all new water quality criteria. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Update&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That bill laid the foundations for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-water-act&quot;&gt;Clean Water Act&lt;/a&gt; of 1972, establishing U.S. regulations for releasing pollutants into navigable waters. While the law protects “waters of the United States,” the definition of what “waters” meant remained vague until a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/06/29/2015-13435/clean-water-rule-definition-of-waters-of-the-united-states&quot;&gt;2015 regulation&lt;/a&gt; defined eight categories of protected waters, which included headwater streams, lakes and wetlands. President Donald Trump’s administration revised that definition in 2020 to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/nwpr/navigable-waters-protection-rule-step-two-revise&quot;&gt;exclude groundwater and some streams&lt;/a&gt;. The change also reduces the number of protected wetlands by roughly half.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-why-african-americans-vulnerable-covid-19-health-race"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3086929</id>
		<updated>2020-04-10T19:20:23+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;COVID-19
was called the great equalizer. Nobody was immune; anybody could succumb. But the
virus’ spread across the United States is exposing racial fault lines, with early
data showing that African-Americans are more likely to die from the disease than
white Americans. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data are still piecemeal, with only some states and
counties breaking down COVID-19 cases and outcomes by race. But even without nationwide
data, the numbers are stark. Where race data are known — for only 3,300 of
13,000 COVID-19 deaths — &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/71d952faad4a2a5d14441534f7230c7c?fbclid=IwAR1plunY_qfeA2KrSU-PA1TuJobAwQh53a_Qlkf5dw0dWjz-iz85GA1FOt4&quot;&gt;African-Americans
account for 42 percent of the deaths&lt;/a&gt;, the Associated Press reported April
9. Those data also suggest the disparity could be highest in the South. For
instance, in both Louisiana and Mississippi, African-Americans account for over
65 percent of known COVID-19 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other regions are seeing disparities as well. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/covid19-statistics&quot;&gt;in Illinois&lt;/a&gt;,
where the bulk of infections are in the Chicago area, 28 percent of the 16,422
confirmed cases as of April 9 were African-Americans, but African-Americans
accounted for nearly 43 percent of the state’s 528 deaths.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other data find similar trends. A study published online
April 8 in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s &lt;em&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/em&gt; looked
at hospitalizations for COVID-19 across 14 states from March 1 to 30. Race
data, which were available for 580 of 1,482 patients, revealed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6915e3.htm?s_cid=mm6915e3_w#contribAff&quot;&gt;African-Americans
accounted for 33 percent of the hospitalizations&lt;/a&gt;, but only 18 percent of
the total population surveyed. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Here are three reasons why African-Americans may be especially
vulnerable to the new coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;1. African-Americans are more likely to be exposed to COVID-19.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms&quot;&gt;highly
contagious&lt;/a&gt;, even before symptoms appear (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/13/20&lt;/em&gt;). So to curb the virus’ spread and limit
person-to-person transmission, states have been issuing stay-at-home orders.
But many individuals are considered part of the critical workforce by the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security and must continue to work. That includes caregivers,
cashiers, sanitation workers, farm workers and public transit employees&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisa.gov/publication/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce&quot;&gt;,
jobs often filled by African-Americans&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, almost 30 percent of employed African-Americans
work in the education and health services industry and 10 percent in retail,
according to 2019 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. African-Americans
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2020/african-american-history-month/home.htm&quot;&gt;are
less likely than employed people in general to work in professional and
business services&lt;/a&gt; — the sorts of jobs more amenable to telecommuting.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Driving
solo to those jobs isn’t always an option. Among urban residents, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/07/who-relies-on-public-transit-in-the-u-s/&quot;&gt;about
34 percent of African-Americans use public transit regularly&lt;/a&gt; compared with
14 percent of white people, according to a 2016 report from the Pew Research
Center, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C. Continued use of public
transit during the pandemic may bring African-Americans into greater contact
with infected people. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally,
a disproportionately high percentage of African-Americans may live in places
that could increase their risk of exposure. Census data from January 2020 show
that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf&quot;&gt;only
44 percent of African-Americans own their own home&lt;/a&gt; compared with almost 74
percent of white people. Consider a family living in a crowded inner-city
apartment, says epidemiologist Martina Anto-Ocrah of the University of
Rochester Medical Center in New York. “Can you possibly take an elevator alone?
No.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;African-Americans’
risk of higher exposure to COVID-19 has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/2019-economic-commentaries/ec-201903-what-is-behind-the-persistence-of-the-racial-wealth-gap.aspx&quot;&gt;historical
roots&lt;/a&gt; — including legal segregation in schools and housing, discrimination
in the labor market and redlining, the practice of denying home loans to those
living in predominantly African-American neighborhoods. Those forces have
contributed to a persistent racial wealth gap, with African-Americans continuing
to struggle to move into neighborhoods with the sorts of socioeconomic
opportunities that allow white families to better avoid exposure to COVID-19.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“All
the ingredients are in place for there to be a sharp racial and class
inequality to this [pandemic],” says Robert Sampson, a sociologist at Harvard
University.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;2. African-Americans have a higher incidence of underlying health conditions.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html&quot;&gt;those
at highest risk&lt;/a&gt; of getting severely ill with COVID-19 are patients with
other serious health problems, such as hypertension, diabetes and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-some-heart-patients-especially-vulnerable&quot;&gt;heart
disease&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/20/20&lt;/em&gt;). Over 40
percent of African-Americans have high blood pressure, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/why-high-blood-pressure-is-a-silent-killer/high-blood-pressure-and-african-americans&quot;&gt;among
the highest rates in the world,&lt;/a&gt; according to the American Heart
Association. By comparison, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@sop/@smd/documents/downloadable/ucm_319587.pdf&quot;&gt;about
a third of white Americans&lt;/a&gt; have high blood pressure. Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diabetes.org/resources/statistics/statistics-about-diabetes&quot;&gt;African-Americans
tend to have higher rates of diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Part
of that heightened risk has to do with &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.osu.edu/low-income-black-neighborhoods-still-hit-hard-by-air-pollution/&quot;&gt;African-Americans’
disproportionate exposure to air pollution&lt;/a&gt;. Such pollution has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/list-diseases-linked-air-pollution-growing&quot;&gt;linked
to chronic health problems&lt;/a&gt;, including asthma, obesity and cardiovascular
disease (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/19/17&lt;/em&gt;). In an April
2019 study in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;,
Sampson and fellow Harvard sociologist Robert Manduca showed that poor African-American
neighborhoods have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-some-low-income-neighborhoods-are-better-others&quot;&gt;higher
levels of lead, air pollution and violence&lt;/a&gt; than poor white neighborhoods (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/12/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers are still sorting out how neighborhood stressors
contribute to poor health. But even if the causes aren’t always clear, research
suggests that helping people move to better neighborhoods can improve health.
For instance, a 2017 study in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt; showed that for
African-American adults, moving out of racially segregated neighborhoods was
linked to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/where-you-live-can-affect-your-blood-pressure-study-suggests&quot;&gt;drop
in blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/15/17&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;3. African-Americans have less access to medical care and often distrust caregivers.  &lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Inequities in access to health care, including
inadequate health insurance, discrimination fears and distance from clinics and
hospitals, make it harder for many African-Americans to access the sort of
preventive care that keeps chronic diseases in check.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According
to a December 2019 report from The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank
based in New York City and Washington, D.C., African-Americans are still more
likely to be uninsured than white Americans. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tcf.org/content/report/racism-inequality-health-care-african-americans/?agreed=1&quot;&gt;And
African-Americans who are insured&lt;/a&gt; spend a greater fraction of their income
on premiums and out-of-pocket costs, about 20 percent, than the average
American, who spends about 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Census
data show that about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.povertyusa.org/facts&quot;&gt;20 percent of
African-Americans live in poverty&lt;/a&gt; compared with 10 percent of white
Americans. As a result, African-Americans have been disproportionately hurt by
some states’ decisions not to expand Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care
Act. Expanded Medicaid has been linked to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medicaid-expansion-states-cardiovascular-deaths&quot;&gt;reduced
likelihood of deaths from cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/7/19&lt;/em&gt;) and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medicaid-expansion-health-gaps-black-white-babies&quot;&gt;reduction
in the racial health gap between white and black babies&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/23/19&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lack of preventive care means that African-Americans are
more likely than other racial groups in the United States to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032315-021439&quot;&gt;hospitalized
or rehospitalized for asthma, diabetes, heart failure and postsurgery
complications&lt;/a&gt;, researchers reported in 2016 in the &lt;em&gt;Annual Review of Public
Health. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;African-Americans can also face hidden biases to care. For instance, an algorithm used to determine which patients should receive access to certain health care programs inadvertently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bias-common-health-care-algorithm-hurts-black-patients&quot;&gt;prioritized white patients over African-American patients&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/24/19&lt;/em&gt;), researchers reported in October 2019 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. That disparity arose because the algorithm used health care spending as a proxy for need, but African-Americans often spend less on health care because they are less likely to go to a doctor. In part that may be because African-Americans have a long-standing distrust of the medical establishment due to events such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ethics-human-experimentation&quot;&gt;Tuskegee experiment&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/1/75&lt;/em&gt;), in which hundreds of African-American men with syphilis were denied treatment for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These
long-standing structural forms of discrimination that African-Americans have
faced in the [United States] are manifesting in what we’re seeing with COVID
right now,” says epidemiologist Kiarri Kershaw of the Northwestern University
Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even so, more can be done to identify communities that might be especially vulnerable to COVID-19 and improve their odds of coping with the pandemic, Sampson says. For example, “look at a map of incarceration, lead risk and violence in Chicago [and] you’ll basically see a map of COVID deaths,” he says. Those kinds of proxies could provide a road map to identifying at-risk communities and targeting resources to them, such as greater access to COVID-19 testing, distribution of masks and mobile clinics to provide care.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Jim and Kerry Kelly live in a small town in the rural Midwest. Their sons, Ben, six, and Ryan, twelve, attend the local public school. Their school district is always short staffed. The closest town is 40 miles away and the pay for teachers is abysmal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the district’s staffing has hit a critical low: Class size will have to be huge, and there’s limited money for aides who might help with the teaching load, which will further discourage teacher applications. The school board considers accepting underqualified teachers. Parents are up in arms. Teachers and principals are stressed. The situation comes to a head at a school board meeting that drags on past midnight with shouting, frustration, threats, and anger. But, it’s too important to back off. Children’s futures are at stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next week, the superintendent finds a possible solution. The state has money available to help school boards implement technology in qualified districts. The Kellys’ town qualifies. They can receive funds to buy robots to serve in the classrooms. The robots can assume some of the teaching load, improve teaching quality, and relieve the overcrowding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, this would have been unthinkable. Soulless machines educating our children? But, solutions are few, and the superintendent has found reports of success from other schools. He sells his plan well, and against all expectations, the school board agrees. The following fall, the Kelly kids, like all the kids in the district, have a robot in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the half-year mark, the school board reviews their decision. In six-year-old Ben’s class, the results are outstanding. Kids learn fast—pretty much as fast from the robot as from the human teacher. And, the kids like the interactions with the machines. The teacher can accomplish more and is less stressed in the process. Everyone is pleased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ryan’s class, at age eleven, has a far different experience. The robot used in their class is identical to the one in Ben’s class—very human-like. By January, the kids hate it. They call it names; they hit it; they learn little from it. By midyear, it sits in a corner, scorned by students and teacher alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This scenario is fiction, but it reflects the real world. Many school districts are hurting for staff, and robots are entering the classroom. In Japan, Robovie speaks and teaches English with elementary school children, like Robosem does in Korea. In the United States, RUBI teaches children Finnish. Child-like robots are helping autistic children practice social interactions through imitation-teaching games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using robots as teachers makes some sense. Children learn much of their knowledge from others: parents, teachers, peers. Children trust that 8 × 8 = 64, that Earth is round, and that dinosaurs are extinct, not because they have uncovered these facts themselves but because reliable sources have told them so. Research shows that children are adapted to learn general knowledge from human communication. The phenomenon is known as “trust in testimony.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, do children trust the testimony of robots? Does it matter if the robot behaves, responds, or even looks like a human? If children learn from a robot, do they learn in the same way they learn from a human teacher? Excellent questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that when children as young as preschool age learn from other people, they monitor their informants’ knowledge, expertise, and confidence. They remember whether a person has given them accurate information in the past. They also monitor an informant’s access to information: Did she see the thing she is telling me about? They attend to the person’s qualifications: Is he a knowledgeable adult or a naïve child?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly little is known about how and if children learn from robots. Because robots are machines, children could see them as infallible, like calculators or electronic dictionaries. If so, they might accept any information from a robot without considering if it is accurate. Or, children might see robots as a more fallible machine: a toaster that burns the toast, a virtual assistant that can give wrong or even outlandish answers or an alarm clock that goes off in the middle of the night. If so, they might resist a robot’s teachings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young children clearly can and do learn from robots, and they are appropriately choosy about the sort of robot teachers they accept. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190860974.001.0001/oso-9780190860974-chapter-8&quot;&gt;Research &lt;/a&gt;also shows that young children are more likely to learn from and accept robot teachers that are older children—just like in Ben Kelly’s first grade classroom—and older children are less likely, even unlikely, to do so—like in Ryan Kelly’s sixth grade classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isaac Asimov’s book, &lt;em&gt;I, Robot&lt;/em&gt;, is primarily about morality and robotics: how robots interact with humans for good or evil. Most of the stories revolve around the efforts of Dr. Susan Calvin, chief roboticist for the fictional U.S. Robotics and Mechanical Men, Incorporated (USRMM), the primary producer of advanced humanoid robots in the world. She worries about aberrant behavior of advanced robots, and she develops a new field, robopsychology, to help figure out what is going on in their electrical (“positronic”) brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All robots produced by USRMM are meant to be programmed with the “Three Laws of Robotics:”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in Asimov’s stories, flaws are found in the robots and their prototypes. These lead to robots imploding, harming people, and in one key case, killing a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I, Robot&lt;/em&gt; stories have spawned numerous spin-offs, continuations, and commentaries. A 2004 episode of &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; (titled “I, D’oh Bot”) featured a robot boxer named Smashius Clay. Smashius, self-defeatingly, follows all of Asimov’s three laws and loses to every human he fights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Twentieth Century Fox 2004 film, &lt;em&gt;I, Robot&lt;/em&gt;, starred Will Smith as detective Dell Spooner of the 2035 Chicago police department. Dell investigates a murder of the roboticist Dr. Alfred Lanning, which may have been at the hand of a USRMM robot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, robots like Robovie (or NAO or RUBI or other robots designed to interact with adults or with children) don’t have moral codes programmed in. But then, they also don’t have anything like full positronic machine intelligence. Conversely, we don’t have laws or codes about how to treat robots. For example, should a really human-like robot have rights? In November 2017, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sophia-robot-citizen-womens-rights-detriot-become-human-hanson-robotics&quot;&gt;granted a very human-looking robot, Sophia, citizenship&lt;/a&gt;. This set off an uproar about rights among women in Saudi Arabia. For example, Saudi women must veil their faces when they are in public; Sophia appeared in public and on TV without a veil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers, robot designers, parents, and teachers have become increasingly concerned that interactions with robots will promote antisocial behaviors. A hitchhiking robot who traveled a bit around Europe, taking pictures and carrying on conversations with other travelers, was vandalized and destroyed after several extended weeks in the United States. And, it’s easy to imagine a world where robots displace humans from jobs and so are attacked and sabotaged by those they’ve displaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that antisocial behaviors toward robots can be reduced by modifying the robots. Preschool children in a classroom comforted a robot with a hug and protected it from aggression when it started to cry after being damaged or played with too roughly. At least &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-04837-001&quot;&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; has shown that younger children say a robot should be treated fairly and should not be psychologically harmed after having conversed and played with the robot for fifteen minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, robots become a larger part of our lives. You can find robots in malls, hotels, assembly lines, hospitals and, of course, research labs. The National Robotics Initiative &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503641&quot;&gt;foresees a future&lt;/a&gt; in which “robots are as commonplace as today’s automobiles, computers, and cell phones. Robots will be found in homes, offices, hospitals, factories, farms, and mines; and in the air, on land, under water, and in space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And robots are becoming more and more present in the lives of children. They are already teaching children in classrooms and helping them in hospitals. Robovie is just one of many robots that have been manufactured in the last few years designed to be used with children–created to play games, answer questions, read stories, and even watch children unsupervised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unbridled production of hopefully child-friendly robots certainly needs more research. But, it’s clear that in some ways and at some ages children can successfully learn from robot teachers who actively interact with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image by Andy Kelly from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/0E_vhMVqL9g&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/why-we-like-a-good-robot-story-2/&quot;&gt;Why we like a good robot story&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/621138918/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/621138918/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/621138918/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/621138918/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/621138918/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/621138918/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/621138918/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/621138918/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/621138918/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/621138918/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-importance-of-character-during-war/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The importance of character during war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-to-rate-and-rank-potential-doctoral-students/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How to rate and rank potential doctoral students&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/04/will-robots-really-take-our-jobs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Will robots really take our jobs?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We know that your daily routines have probably changed due to COVID-19. Whether you’re keeping more distance between yourself and others, working from home more often, or feeling isolated by larger-scale shutdowns, it may take awhile for things to go back to normal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;During this time of uncertainty, we want you to know: we are here to support you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Without knowing at this point what the long-term impact will be of interrupted research projects, conferences, and teaching schedules, we’re trying to find out more about you and your unique situation so that we can provide you with the information you most want. Last week, we launched a survey for researchers to let us know how their work has changed in recent weeks and we wanted to share some of the preliminary results with you as we dig in deeper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;First, a couple of caveats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This survey data comes from an informal marketing poll surfaced through email and on our site beginning on March 27. The survey links are still available and we’re collecting new responses every day but the summary below is based off of responses received between March 27 and April 3 only.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We also posted a simplified version on our Twitter account to take the pulse from a broader community. Those data are not included in this summary but we saw very similar trends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Survey Structure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;While the initial question was the same for each researcher who entered the survey, the second-tier question was tailored to their response from Question 1. Partial responses (results where researchers answered the first question only) are included in the breakdown below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Survey-Chart-3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-42953&quot; height=&quot;436&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Survey-Chart-3-1024x436.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;What’s the scale of the impact?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Most researchers said their work was interrupted  in some way, either by restricted access to their labs, or a need to take personal time off. Only 7.2% of respondents reported that their lab was open and operating normally. Another 4.3% reported that their work is directly relevant to the outbreak and are actively investigating. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Of those few whose labs were operating normally, 33.3% were “very” concerned that they would see steeper closures in the next few days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_42952&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-42952 size-full&quot; height=&quot;371&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Response breakdown to Question #1. Total Responses: 54, 749&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In what ways are researchers able to continue their work?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For those whose labs or institutions have been closed, many researchers have found a way to continue their work remotely (36.2%). Of those, 58.6% reported that their research, or elements of it, could be done without a lab, although 34.8% said they had to shift to something like protocol design or new analysis that would not require a lab. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For the researchers who’ve had to change their focus (26%) or cancel fieldwork entirely (18%), writing and training have become the major focus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_42954&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-42954 size-full&quot; height=&quot;371&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart-1.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Response breakdown for Question 2 for those who said they needed to cancel or shift the focus of their existing work&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As researchers’ needs change, so should the way we support them&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serving authors on the front lines&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For those respondents who have told us they are actively investigating research related to the coronavirus, speed matters more than anything else. At PLOS, we are fast-tracking all research related to COVID-19, the first studies of which we have already published and made available in our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://collections.plos.org/covid-19&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;COVID-19 collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; which surfaces research from across all PLOS Journals along with other relevant content. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Redefining priorities for career advancement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A number of organizations have come together to support researchers during this time. For example,  the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) released a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/2020/04/06/dora-statement-on-hiring-promotion-and-funding-decisions-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;statement &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; earlier this week,calling on research institutions and universities to evaluate their hiring, promotion, and funding decisions within the context of the broad-scale interruptions researchers are facing in their daily work. The statement specifically asks institutions to:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Redefine their expectations for productivity in the wake of the present pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Communicate clearly to academics and researchers how they will modify research evaluation procedures for hiring, promotion, and tenure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS fully supports this appeal and urges all institutions and funders to join those who have already &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U5REApf-t-76UXh8TKAGoLlwy8WIMfSSyqCJbb5u9lA/edit#gid=0&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;taken action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and consider similar policies to let researchers know that their careers will not grind to a halt due to the impact of the pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If COVID-19 has impacted your ability to continue reviewing, editing, or revising manuscripts in process at PLOS, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/03/a-message-to-our-community-regarding-covid-19/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;we encourage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; you to reach out to the journal for an extension so that you can take the time you need to focus on other concerns.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If there is another way we can help support the communication and discovery of research as your publishing needs change, please consider sharing your thoughts by emailing us at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:community@pos.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;community@plos.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; or by responding to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://surveys.plos.org/s3/covid-survey&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;the survey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; itself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing what to say when a friend is upset or stressed out can be a delicate balancing act. Sometimes the best route seems to be to offer advice and give practical suggestions as to how they should proceed; at other times, simply listening to what your friend has to say is by far the better option. But no matter your approach, ensuring that your friend feels validated is key, argue Xi Tian and colleagues in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/70/1/13/5739595?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Communication&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39448&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The study starts with a question many of us have pondered ourselves: why do some well-intentioned attempts at comfort come off as insensitive instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the question, the team asked 325 married adults to think of one person with whom they’d discussed their partner or marriage, and to imagine having a conversation with them about a recent argument they’d had with their spouse. They were then presented with one of six support messages, each of which was more or less person-centred — in other words, more or less willing to acknowledge and elaborate on the feelings of the upset person. Low person-centred messages focused on simply moving past the argument (e.g. “nobody is worth getting so worked up about… having an argument is not the worst thing that could happen to you”), whilst high person-centred messages were more engaged and acknowledged the individuals’ feelings (e.g. “you have every right to feel upset… it’s understandable you are stressed out”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants then rated the support messages on a number of measures, including how controlling and dominant, direct and clear, or logical and well-justified the messages were. They also reported whether they felt pressured by their friend, and indicated the extent to which they experienced psychological “reactance”: that is, how angry they were after reading the message, and how critical they felt of it. Finally, they rated how optimistic they would feel after receiving the message and how much their emotions would improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, low person-centred messages were not successful in helping people feel better about disputes with their partner, nor did they reduce emotional distress. These types of messages angered participants, and were also seen as domineering and lacked argument strength — in other words, they were neither convincing nor comforting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, high person-centred messages were associated with higher levels of emotional improvement, which the team puts down partly to the fact participants felt little or no threat to their freedom when responding to these messages (i.e. they didn’t feel pressured or controlled by their friend). There was also less emotional reactance to high person-centred messages — participants felt less angry, less critical and less likely to argue with their friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations to the study: the messages participants received were, of course, fake, so the way they would feel about them in the context of a real conversation with a friend may differ from the artificial environment of the study. Future studies may also take into consideration the diversity of relationships and their social contexts — as the team notes, the majority of participants were in heterosexual relationships, in their first marriages and white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will, of course, be times when you believe a friend really is overreacting — that they’re making a big deal over nothing. At times like these, the results of this study may be useful to keep in mind. If you want to make them feel comforted, acknowledging, not dismissing, what they’re feeling is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/70/1/13/5739595?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;How the Comforting Process Fails: Psychological Reactance to Support Messages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/domestic-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an unprecedented global health emergency. At this writing, COVID-19 has affected more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/world-map.html&quot;&gt;173 countries&lt;/a&gt;, causing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200403-sitrep-74-covid-19-mp.pdf?sfvrsn=4e043d03_4&quot;&gt;972,303 infections and 50,322 deaths&lt;/a&gt;. Highly contagious, coronavirus spreads through human-to-human contact, with the number of infections doubling every three days. Neither vaccine nor cure exists for COVID-19, although several &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins&quot;&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are underway. Prevention is cure, and physical distancing is the most effective prevention endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mandatory quarantines or non-mandatory stay-at-home advisories are in effect in countries around the world, affecting one third of the global population. Homebound, people are physically distant from wider social networks: school-age children are receiving homeschooling; college students are attending online classes from home; non-essential service employees are working from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, one in three women experience domestic violence over their lifetimes, and 4-12% during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11833 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/300px-Purple_ribbon.svg_-191x300.png&quot; width=&quot;191&quot; /&gt;Unfortunately, stay-at-home may not mean safer-at-home for millions of women worldwide. Home is where women experience violence in the hands of their spouses or extended family members. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17027732&quot;&gt;Domestic violence&lt;/a&gt;, including physical, sexual, reproductive, emotional, or economic, is a health and human rights violation, leading to mental and physical health consequences, including death. Globally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/9789241564625/en/&quot;&gt;one in three women&lt;/a&gt; experience domestic violence over their lifetimes, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/70764/WHO_RHR_11.35_eng.pdf?sequence=1&quot;&gt;4-12% &lt;/a&gt;during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domestic violence can be an unintended consequence of COVID-19 lockdowns, which have been essential for suppressing the spread. Prior evidence makes it a possibility: domestic violence rates went up during &lt;a href=&quot;https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgrvv/25/5/588&quot;&gt;emergencies&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/44126540?seq=1&quot;&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077801210377649?casa_token=GjwbzDKcC64AAAAA:3Zy3qOkMZDtbf5AcFxAlmRNIGgvC13FAD6d6bdw9rRFnWYlcXpU6tRFV6Pa9o3sWX_PXclVWK-HC&quot;&gt;globally&lt;/a&gt;. High risk (stuck in home with abuser), low protection (socially distant from family, friends, neighbors, coworkers) makes it a probability. Indeed, frontline workers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/06/827908402/global-lockdowns-resulting-in-horrifying-surge-in-domestic-violence-u-n-warns&quot;&gt;from a diverse set of countries&lt;/a&gt; and cultures, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-see-rise-domestic-violence-calls-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-n1176151&quot;&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/28/domestic-violence-cases-jump-30-during-lockdown-in-france&quot;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-italy-violence/in-italy-support-groups-fear-lockdown-is-silencing-domestic-abuse-victims-idUSKBN21M0PM&quot;&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/COVID-19-Fears-of-Domestic-Violence-Rise-as-Millions-Confined-20200328-0009.html&quot;&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/rise-in-family-abuse-cases-in-australia-linked-to-covid-19&quot;&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://in-cyprus.philenews.com/sharp-rise-in-domestic-violence-amid-covid-19-outbreak/&quot;&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/277940&quot;&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://supchina.com/2020/03/24/covid-19-fuels-domestic-violence-in-china/&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nepalitimes.com/latest/lockdown-and-the-surge-in-domestic-violence/&quot;&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/domestic-abuse-cases-rise-as-covid-19-lockdown-turns-into-captivity-for-many-women-819653.html&quot;&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arabnews.com/node/1652146/middle-east&quot;&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/06/827908402/global-lockdowns-resulting-in-horrifying-surge-in-domestic-violence-u-n-warns&quot;&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, have reported an increase in the number of calls to domestic-violence hotlines, or of police complaints. In absence of population-based estimates before and after COVID-19 lockdowns, existing reports are invaluable alternatives, indicating, at a minimum, an upswing in violence re-victimization, potentially globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, domestic violence happens in homosexual as well as heterosexual relationships. Violence can be perpetrated by both men and women against their partners of the same or opposite gender. However, men’s perpetration of violence against women is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/gender.pdf&quot;&gt;most common form&lt;/a&gt; of domestic violence worldwide, with consequences more intense, lingering &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w24802&quot;&gt;across generations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preventing a potential outbreak of domestic violence during an emergency seems plausible. Conceptually, programs found to be effective in preventing conditions triggering men’s perpetration of domestic violence are likely be effective in reducing domestic violence. I discuss three such conditions and programs. Intersecting vulnerabilities (younger age, poverty, lower education levels) increase women’s vulnerability to experiencing multiple violence-triggering conditions, simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-induced economic recession heightens the risk of marital conflicts, often resulting in men’s violence perpetration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, COVID-induced economic recession, and consequent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4860387/&quot;&gt;livelihood loss&lt;/a&gt; by either or both partners, and subsequent financially stressful times leaving families with resource constraints for life essentials, or the need for rationing, heightens the risk of marital conflicts, often resulting in men’s violence perpetration. Conversely, potential COVID-19 exposures through employment in essential services can be traumatic, triggering &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/us/coronavirus-lockdown-domestic-violence.html&quot;&gt;marital conflicts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://behavioralscientist.org/the-cognitive-burden-of-poverty/&quot;&gt;Cognitive burdens&lt;/a&gt; (preoccupation with financial woes impedes &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-11831&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/wallet-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;one’s ability to do the right thing; fear of disease exposure) make both partners vulnerable to violence perpetration; the higher social position of men make them more susceptible. The risk is greater for men holding traditional views on gender roles (feeling that they have failed as “the provider of the family,” and at-risk of losing power and control), growing up experiencing or watching violence (getting cues of action from “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Publications/WDR/WDR%202015/WDR-2015-Full-Report.pdf&quot;&gt;mental models&lt;/a&gt;” of conflict resolutions), or are engaged in &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2005.00994.x&quot;&gt;substance use&lt;/a&gt; (blurring judgement, misplaced priorities), compared to men with comparable levels of vulnerability and susceptibility but without such attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, disruptions in the operation of service-delivery institutions (e.g., schools; day care centers; restaurants; dry cleaners) and subsequent abrupt need for (primarily) women assuming significantly more roles than usual can result in women’s excessive workload, stress, anxiety, maladaptive coping including substance use, increasing their vulnerabilities to domestic violence (re)victimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, homebound for long, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/upshot/gender-roles-housework.html&quot;&gt;couples&lt;/a&gt;, even those more egalitarian, may experience increasing intensification or rebound of traditional gender roles and relations, with women, charged with caregiving among other domestic responsibilities, becoming the default target of blame for discomforts, inconveniences, or unmet needs. A prolonged, 24/7 stay at a proximity increases the use of household space and resources for meeting most daily-living essentials, increasing the frequency of interactions between intimate partners and, thereby, opportunities for marital conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easier access to domestic violence hotlines and to shelters that are safe will improve women’s ability to seek help despite constraints&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for violence prevention and mitigation, the following three policies or programs seem promising. However, a broader, multisectoral approach to address women’s deprivation in terms of education, nutrition, healthcare, family planning or economic empowerment underlying women’s vulnerability to violence should be integrated into overall emergency preparedness efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a financial safety net (for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&amp;amp;context=carsey&quot;&gt;unemployment insurance in the US&lt;/a&gt;, India’s direct unconditional cash transfers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-launches-mega-cash-transfer-to-fight-covid-19/articleshow/74975904.cms&quot;&gt;women&lt;/a&gt;, and poor households, etc.) will likely keep household’s overall consumption at a comparable level, enhancing women’s capacity for violence-risks management, and, thereb&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11829 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/domvio-256x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;256&quot; /&gt;y, enhancing the safety of women and their children. Second, addressing factors that trigger violence during stressful times is key. For example, a ban on alcohol sales, limiting hours of alcohol sales, or limiting the volume sold per person, as appropriate in each context, will curb access to alcoholic beverages, reducing excessive alcohol consumption and related harms including violence against women and children. Third, easier access to domestic violence hotlines and to shelters that are safe will improve women’s ability to seek help despite constraints (i.e., abuser is nearby) and relocate (i.e., women can still practice physical distancing in shelters), significantly limiting the risk of violence re-victimization. To ensure easy access, countries must ensure: (a) adequate resources for domestic-violence services and shelters as an essential service; and (b) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/02/01/more-than-1-billion-women-lack-legal-protection-against-domestic-sexual-violence-finds-world-bank-study&quot;&gt;legal protection against domestic violence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s in our common interest, as human beings and social and economic actors, to be serious about integrating domestic violence prevention and mitigation into COVID-19 preparedness and relief efforts. The alternative is unethical, keeping a blind eye to human right violations, and seems suboptimal: needing direct medical and mental health care services, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/06/827908402/global-lockdowns-resulting-in-horrifying-surge-in-domestic-violence-u-n-warns&quot;&gt;global surge&lt;/a&gt; in domestic violence could be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/opinion/2013/03/07/putting-a-price-on-violence-against-women-and-girls&quot;&gt;costly&lt;/a&gt;, potentially compromising COVID-19 responses inside and outside the health sector.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein is often used as the ultimate inspirational figure in science: an untamed genius with an abundance of innate brilliance. The proliferation of memes and inspirational quotes about his allegedly underwhelming school performance only serves to highlight exactly how naturally brilliant he really was, succeeding against the odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, it turns out, he might not be quite as inspiring as you think: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01973533.2020.1734006&quot;&gt;according to a study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Basic and Applied Social Psychology, &lt;/em&gt;it may in fact be hard work, not innate genius, that really inspires people to get into STEM.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39443&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first study focused on two specific scientists: Einstein, who is generally viewed as a genius whose success came from his talent, and Edison, whose success is seen to have come from hard work — famously, it took him over one thousand attempts to successfully create the lightbulb. Danfei Hu from Penn State and colleagues gave 176 participants a story about either Einstein or Edison, both of which included details about struggles, challenges and setbacks the scientists had supposedly faced during their career (in fact, the stories for each scientist were exactly the same).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants then filled in a survey to measure their views on talent and intelligence, rating how much they agreed with statements including “only geniuses can be good scientists”, “some people just aren’t cut out for science” and “you have a certain amount of intelligence, and you can’t do much to change it”. Participants then completed an apparently unconnected maths task, designed to investigate their approaches to problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those in the Edison condition were less likely to see exceptional talent as necessary for a scientist’s success, and slightly more likely to believe that intelligence was malleable or changeable. This group also performed better on the mathematical task, suggesting that they’d received a boost in motivation by reading about a scientist known for his work ethic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To look at the impact of fame on motivation and inspiration, the team recruited 162 participants for a second study. Participants once again read one of two identical stories about a struggling scientist, half reading about Einstein and the other about Mark Johnson, a fictional scientist whom none of them had heard of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, participants who read about Mark Johnson were less likely to believe that innate genius or talent was necessary for success than those who read about Einstein — and they performed better in the maths test, too. This suggests that a non-famous scientist may in fact make for a more effective role model than a famous, “genius” scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final study looked at all three scientists simultaneously: 288 participants read either about the struggles of Edison, Einstein or the non-famous scientist. Those who read about Einstein appeared less motivated than those who read about the non-famous scientist, while those who read about Edison were more motivated, suggesting that the two role models had opposite effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team suggests that being exposed to a stereotypically “genius” scientist makes people feel brilliance is a prerequisite to succeed — that it’s essential, rather than an additional benefit. As many people don’t particularly see themselves as innately brilliant, their performance — and their interest and motivation to do well in science — is therefore diminished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The successes of someone like Edison, however, might seem more in reach — his example suggests that scientific successes are related more to effort and self-control than they are to genius, making people feel more inclined to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Role models can play an important part in efforts to encourage a wider range of people to pursue STEM both educationally and professionally: female mentors, for example, have been shown to increase female students’ sense of belonging in engineering settings. Understanding what makes certain role models effective could therefore help this process considerably, allowing universities and other institutions to develop mentoring programmes that really help make STEM subjects more diverse and equal places to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01973533.2020.1734006&quot;&gt;Not All Scientists Are Equal: Role Aspirants Influence Role Modeling Outcomes in STEM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 Nerd Food: Computational Finance, Part I: Introduction&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first part of what we hope will be a long series of articles exploring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantlib.org/&quot;&gt;QuantLib&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine&quot;&gt;Open Source Risk Engine&lt;/a&gt; (ORE), &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system&quot;&gt;libbitcoin&lt;/a&gt;and other interesting finance-related FOSS (Free and Open Source) projects. However, I'm afraid this will be a bit of a dull first post, as we need to clarify our objectives before we can jump into the fray. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-orgc99cdfe&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;orgc99cdfe&quot;&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-orgc99cdfe&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though I've been a software engineer in the financial sector for over fifteen years, I've always felt I lacked a &lt;i&gt;deep understanding&lt;/i&gt;of the foundational concepts that make up the domain. As a self-confessed reductionist, I find this state of affairs extremely uncomfortable, akin to hearing a continuous loop of David Hilbert's words: &lt;i&gt;wir müssen wissen, wir werden wissen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.1&quot; id=&quot;fnr.1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The situation &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; to be remedied, somehow, and the material you are now reading is the proposed fix for my ailments. As to the methodology: given I've had some success in applying the Feynman Technique&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.2&quot; id=&quot;fnr.2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/2015/08/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks.html&quot;&gt;other complex domains&lt;/a&gt;, it seemed only natural to try to use it for this endeavour as well. Past experience also demonstrated writing is an adequate replacement for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;communication, which is just as well in this brave new world of social distancing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So that's that for the &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt;. But, just &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; exactly are we researching? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-org038ff83&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;org038ff83&quot;&gt;Scope&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-org038ff83&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These posts shall largely amble where our fancy takes us, within the porous boundaries of finance. Alas, we can hardly keep calling our target domain &quot;trading, accounting, crypto and a bit of quantitative finance, when viewed through the lens of FOSS&quot; - descriptive though that might sound. We are Software Engineers after all, and if there is one thing we do is to name things, &lt;i&gt;especially&lt;/i&gt; when we lack competence to do so&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.3&quot; id=&quot;fnr.3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In this vein, I decided to call this motley domain of ours &quot;Computational Finance&quot;. Should the name have merit, I'm afraid I have little claim to it, as it was shamelessly stolen from this passage in &lt;a href=&quot;https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/09/how-to-teach-computational-thinking/&quot;&gt;Wolfram's writings&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors, lawyers, teachers, farmers, whatever. The future of all these professions will be full of computational thinking. Whether it’s sensor-based medicine, computational contracts, education analytics or computational agriculture - success is going to rely on being able to do computational thinking well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed an interesting trend. Pick any field X, from archeology to zoology. There either is now a “computational X” or there soon will be. And it’s widely viewed as the future of the field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;These seemed like inspiring words for anyone embarking on a long and uncertain journey, so we made them our own and, in turn, it gave us a name to rally around. But what of its boundaries? One of the biggest challenges facing the reductionist is that, in the limit, &lt;i&gt;everything is interconnected with everything else&lt;/i&gt;, for there is no natural halting function. Thus, if you are not careful, all paths will eventually lead you into the realm of quarks and particle physics, regardless of your starting point. Now, that would not be an entirely useful outcome. I have never found a completely satisfactory answer to this question in any on my previous meanderings, but in general I tend to follow an empiric approach and let &lt;i&gt;taste&lt;/i&gt; be my guide&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.4&quot; id=&quot;fnr.4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Granted, its probably not the scientific solution you were expecting, but it seems that there are &quot;intuitive&quot; boundaries in subjects, and when we hit one of those we shall stop&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.5&quot; id=&quot;fnr.5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As an example, for our purposes we need not look in detail at legal frameworks when trying to understand financial concepts, though the two disciplines are deeply intertwined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-orgd3a5007&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;orgd3a5007&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-orgd3a5007&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;An issue which is closely interrelated with the previous one is on how to strike a balance between computational exploration versus domain definitions. Too much exploration and you proceed full steam ahead without knowing the meaning of things; too many boring definitions and they become just words without bringing any light to the subject under scrutiny. The sweet spot lies somewhere in the middle. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our approach can be described as follows. We shall try to progress very slowly and methodically through the concepts in the domain, building them up as we climb the abstraction ladder but without making them too dense and technical. We'll make extensive use of Wikipedia definitions, where possible, but keeping these focused only on the point at hand rather than exploring the myriad of possibilities around a theme. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, we shall try to marry domain concepts with our chosen implementations - the computational experiments part - in order to illustrate their purpose and get a better understanding at what it is that they are trying to do. So, each post will be focused on one fairly narrow subject area, start with a bunch of definitions which are hopefully self-explanatory and then proceed to explore the available implementations on that topic, or code that we write ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-org81de0c9&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;org81de0c9&quot;&gt;Audience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-org81de0c9&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The target audience for this material is the fabled &lt;i&gt;homo developus&lt;/i&gt;, that non-existent &quot;standard developer&quot; - in this particular case, one moderately competent on C++ but unfamiliar with computational finance. On the &quot;finance&quot; part, if you are already familiar with the domain, you will no doubt find the content &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; slow going. I'm afraid this is by design: the objective is to try to build the concepts on a solid foundation for those &lt;i&gt;not in the know&lt;/i&gt;, so slowness is unavoidable&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.6&quot; id=&quot;fnr.6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With regards to the computational part: the astute reader will likely point out that there are a great deal of tutorials on QuantLib, ORE and many other libraries of a similar ilk, and many books have been written on quantitative finance. One could be forgiven for wondering if there is a need to pile on more literature onto a seemingly already crowded subject. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our defence, we are yet to find work that directly targets &quot;plain&quot; software developers and provides them with a sufficiently broad view of the domain. In addition, most of the existing material is aimed at either those with strong mathematical abilities but no domain knowledge, or its converse, leaving many gaps in the understanding. What we are instead aiming for is to target those with strong programming abilities but no particular knowledge of either computational finance &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; mathematics. And this leads us nicely to our next topic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-org04a295b&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;org04a295b&quot;&gt;Mathematics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-org04a295b&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our assumption is that you, dear reader, are not able to attain deep levels of understanding by staring at page after page of complex mathematical formulae. I, for one, certainly cannot. Unfortunately, non-trivial mathematics is difficult to avoid when covering a subject matter of this nature so, as a counterweight, we shall strive to use it sparingly and only from a software engineering &lt;i&gt;application&lt;/i&gt;perspective. Note that this approach is clearly not suitable for the mathematically savvy amongst us, as they will find it unnecessarily laboured; then again, our focus lies elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our core belief is that an &lt;i&gt;average reader&lt;/i&gt; (like me) should be able to attain a software engineer's intuition of &lt;i&gt;how things work&lt;/i&gt; just by fooling around with software models of formulae. The reason why I am very confident on this regard is because that's how developers learn: by coding and seeing what happens. In fact, it is this very tight feedback loop between having an idea and experimenting with it that got many of us hooked into programming in the first place, so its a very powerful tool in the motivational arsenal. And, as it turns out, these ideas are related to Wolfram's concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-3-12--history-of-experimental-mathematics/&quot;&gt;Experimental Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, our aspiration is to copy the approach taken by Klein in &lt;a href=&quot;https://codingthematrix.com/&quot;&gt;Coding the Matrix&lt;/a&gt;, though perhaps that sets the bar a tad too high. Well, at least you get the spirit of the approach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-org3d4740f&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;org3d4740f&quot;&gt;Cryptos&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-org3d4740f&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another rather peculiar idea we pursued is the use of cryptocurrencies throughout, to the exclusion of &lt;i&gt;everything else&lt;/i&gt;. Whilst very popular in the media, where they are known as &lt;i&gt;cryptos&lt;/i&gt;, in truth cryptocurrencies still have a limited presence in the &quot;real&quot; world of finance, and nowhere more so than in derivatives - &lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt;, the bulk of our analysis. So at first blush, this is a most puzzling choice. We have decided to do so for three reasons. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Firstly, just because I wanted to learn more about cryptos. Secondly, because there is a need to bridge the knowledge gap between these two distinct worlds of finance; to blend the old with the new if you will. Personally, I think it will be interesting to see what the proliferation of derivatives will do to cryptos - but for that we need to disseminate financial knowledge. Finally, and most important of all, because in order to properly illustrate all of the concepts we shall cover, and to drive the open source libraries to their potential, one needs &lt;i&gt;vast amounts of data of the right kind&lt;/i&gt;. Lets elaborate further on this point. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest problems with any material in quantitative finance is in obtaining data sets which are sufficiently rich to cover all of the concepts being explained. This, in my opinion, is one of the key shortcomings with most tutorials: they either assume users can source the data themselves, or provide a small data set to prove a very specific point but which is insufficient for wider exploration&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footref&quot; href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.7&quot; id=&quot;fnr.7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This document takes a slightly different approach. We will base ourselves on a &lt;i&gt;simulated world&lt;/i&gt; - a parallel reality if you'd like, thinly anchored to our reality by freely available data taken from the crypto markets. We shall then generate &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of the remaining data, to the level of precision, richness and consistency required both to drive the code samples, but also to allow for &quot;immersive&quot; exploration. In fact, the &lt;i&gt;very processes for data generation&lt;/i&gt; will be used as a pathway for domain exploration. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, generated data is not perfect - &lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;realistic&lt;/i&gt; it is not, by definition - but our point is to understand the concepts, not to create new quant models that trade in the real world, so it is adequate for our needs. In addition, the data sets and code samples, as well as the means used to derive them shall be part of a git repository under an open source licence, so they can be extended and improved over time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with cryptos, don't worry. For starters, we can &lt;i&gt;assume&lt;/i&gt; the intricate mechanistic details to a large extent - the blockchain and so forth - and introduce key concepts as required. We need not concern ourselves with this because there is plenty of freely available material covering it in excruciating detail, and designed specifically for software engineers. Instead, we shall treat cryptos &lt;i&gt;as if they were regular currencies&lt;/i&gt;, except where they are just &lt;i&gt;too different&lt;/i&gt; - in which case we'll point out the differences. Its a bit of a strange approach, but hopefully it will produce the desired results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-org92cf76f&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;org92cf76f&quot;&gt;Non Goals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-org92cf76f&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are trying to learn techniques on how to trade, this is not the material for you. Even when we discuss trading strategies and other similar topics, our focus is always on trying to understand how the machinery works rather than on how to make money with it. Similarly, if you are a quant or are trying to become one, you are probably better off reading the traditional books such as Hull or Wilmott rather than these posts, as our treatment of mathematics will be far too basic for your requirements. However, if you are an expert in this subject area, or if you find any mistakes please do point them out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-orge684ba8&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;orge684ba8&quot;&gt;Legalese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-orge684ba8&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with anything to do with finance, we need to set out the standard disclaimers. To make sure these are seen, we shall add them to each post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-org8f32d9b&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;org8f32d9b&quot;&gt;Legal Disclaimer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-org8f32d9b&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the content, including source code, is either written by the author of the posts, or obtained from freely available sites in the internet, with suitable software licences.

 &lt;p&gt;As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt; staff and leadership would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to our community of volunteers, as well as the authors submitting their work to &lt;a href=&quot;http://arXiv.org&quot;&gt;arXiv.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/moderators/&quot;&gt;180 moderators&lt;/a&gt;, representing 22 countries across the globe, have continued to sift through thousands of submissions, ensure quality, and post research on arxiv.org despite significant disruptions to their personal and professional lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern” on January 30, 2020, more than 26,000 scholarly works have been announced on the site, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/covid19search&quot;&gt;many related to the coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;. March 2020 was the second busiest month in arXiv history, with 14,415 new papers posted. This is a testament to the astounding effectiveness of arXiv’s moderators. It also reflects the incredible vibrancy of the global research community and the fact that the pursuit of knowledge continues despite the pandemic. We’re proud that arXiv is used extensively to share knowledge across disciplines and across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/people/scientific_ad_board&quot;&gt;Scientific&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/people/member_ad_board&quot;&gt;Member Advisory Boards&lt;/a&gt; also continue to honor their commitment to arXiv, meeting with the new executive director, corresponding via email, and contributing their perspectives on operations and aspirations for 2020 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at arXiv, our staff has been working remotely for several weeks now, like so many of our colleagues. And so it is from our home offices that, again, we thank our volunteers and share our gratitude for the strong arXiv community that remains connected during this difficult time. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensuring you’re well-informed before making a choice is, on the whole, a sensible thing to do. This is especially true of big decisions — just pretending you’ve read the terms and conditions of a new website might be okay, but we’re unlikely to be so lax about our health or finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But could too &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; information lead us to make worse, not better, decisions? A study published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-020-0206-z&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that sometimes that might be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39433&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Min Zheng and colleagues were motivated by advances in machine learning that have increased the information available to feed into decision-making, particularly when it comes to models of cause and effect: these algorithms can reveal potential outcomes likely to happen from certain actions or inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to human decision-making, it’s unclear how useful such information is. Simply presenting causal information to people may not actually help them make decisions: as senior author &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stevens.edu/news/turns-out-there-such-thing-tmi-more-information-doesnt-necessarily-help-people-make-better&quot;&gt;Samantha Kleinberg says&lt;/a&gt;, “being accurate is not enough for information to be useful”. In particular, we don’t know how this information might interact with the knowledge and beliefs people already have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An initial experiment tested how causal information influences the kinds of decisions we make in everyday life. The team presented 1,718 participants with a real world scenario and asked them to give advice on how they would approach it. Participants were told that Jane, a university fresher, wanted to avoid putting on weight but continue to have fun with her friends, and were asked what one thing she should do to achieve her goal: go for a half hour walk every weekend, maintain a healthy diet, avoid seeing her friends, or watch less TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third of the participants were given no extra information to help them answer the question, another third were given a text-based causal explanation of the impact of diet and regular exercise on weight loss, and the final third were given a simple causal diagram. Those in the latter two categories were also asked whether the causal explanations had been helpful or affected their answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; data-shortcode=&quot;caption&quot; id=&quot;attachment_39435&quot; style=&quot;width: 670px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Zheng et al 2020&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-39435&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;39435&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Zheng et al 2020&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/zheng-et-al-2020.png?w=670&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/zheng-et-al-2020.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/zheng-et-al-2020.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;670,431&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/04/06/having-too-much-information-can-lead-us-to-make-worse-decisions/zheng-et-al-2020/&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/zheng-et-al-2020.png?w=845&quot; /&gt;Some participants saw causal information in the form of text or a diagram. &lt;em&gt;Via&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-020-0206-z&quot;&gt;Zheng et al (2020)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those in the no-information condition were highly accurate: 88.8% picked the correct answer (i.e. that Jane should maintain a healthy diet). But those in the two conditions provided with causal information performed &lt;em&gt;worse: &lt;/em&gt;82.7% got the correct answer with the text-based explanation, and 80.1% with the diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second experiment followed a similar method, except in this case the scenario was one that only some participants would have experience dealing with: the management of type 2 diabetes. Participants were asked whether it would be best for someone with diabetes to manage their condition through behaving as normal, through walking more, or by choosing a healthier dinner and going cycling. They were either given no information or a diagram showing the impact of exercise and healthy eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When no causal information was given, participants with and without type 2 diabetes chose the right answer (i.e. choosing a healthy meal and going for a bike ride) at about the same rate. Additional causal information was useful for those without personal experience of diabetes, increasing accuracy to 86.6% — but when the type 2 diabetes group were given causal information, accuracy dropped to just 50%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, along with the results from the first experiment, suggests that causal diagrams themselves are not inherently useless: rather, their ability to improve our decision-making depends on our personal experience. When a situation is new to us, we can benefit from causal information, but when we are already familiar with it, this information can actually lead us to making worse decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team thinks this has something to do with our existing mental models. We don’t take causal information at face value, but instead our existing beliefs and experience influence our decisions. This can sometimes mean we don’t make the right choice: with extra information we can lose confidence and start second-guessing ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final experiment confirmed these findings: when participants had personal experience with a topic, causal information reduced their accuracy, but in made-up scenarios, such as a question on alien mind reading, participants were able to use causal information to make accurate choices. “In situations where people do not have background knowledge, they become more confident with the new information and make better decisions,” says Kleinberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean that information uncovered by machine learning isn’t valuable — quite the contrary. But understanding what people already believe, and tailoring information to that, may be the best way to communicate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-020-0206-z&quot;&gt;How causal information affects decisions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Emotions seem by their very nature to defy scientific analysis. Private and evanescent, and yet powerful and determining, feelings resist systematic observation and measurement. We are lucky to catch a glimpse in a facial expression or inflection of speech. The emotions of animals are all the more difficult. Without words to communicate what might be in their minds or on their nerves, animals–ranging from the complex to the simple–remain nearly a closed emotional book for even the cleverest experiment. A century ago Robert Yerkes, then at Harvard, registered these frustrations. Little is “of more obvious importance scientifically than affection,” he wrote in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://archive.org/details/introductiontop03yerkgoog/page/n7/mode/2up&quot;&gt;Introduction to Psychology&lt;/a&gt;, in 1911, but its study lags behind investigation of “cognitive consciousness.” Convenient as it might be to assume animals are machinelike anyway, our behavior in the laboratory, he observed earlier in his &lt;em&gt;Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology&lt;/em&gt; in 1906, betrays our logic. “Even those who claim that animals are automata do not treat them as such.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shrewd as Yerkes was about his specialty of animal behavior, he would have been puzzled by the idea that national loyalty influenced his science. His research ethos was empiricism: Infer conclusions from carefully collected facts. As he succinctly advised in 1904 in the same journal, “experiment much and speculate little.” Other Americans agreed. John B. Watson’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.all-about-psychology.com/psychology-as-the-behaviorist-views-it.html&quot;&gt;Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It&lt;/a&gt;” of 1913 proposed to make the field “purely objective” by jettisoning the “yoke of consciousness.” That a conscious mind exists at all, in Watson’s view, was mere supposition. It makes sense that it was the German-born émigré ornithologist, Ernst Mayr, who recognized the American devotion to practicality as a national bias. When his Dutch friend, Niko Tinbergen, planned lectures for a US tour in 1946, Mayr wrote to him that “American scientists do not care for too much speculation but like thorough analysis of observed phenomena.” Indeed, deficient experimentation and excessive theorizing became a polemical weapon in international debate. Intellectual precision was–and is–the mark of good science, but American investigators of animal sensibility once claimed it as their special national possession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the danger of scientific myopia nurtured by pride is obvious, these Americans’ faith in their superior practice ironically became a path forward toward internationalism. Their zeal for conducting animal behavior experiments produced real insights into affective experience. They had something to contribute abroad. In the process, they traveled the world for fieldwork, made far-flung professional acquaintances, and opened the door to refugee scientists displaced by the twentieth century’s political turmoil. Scientific passion stoked nationalism, but also gradually undermined it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;354&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Racoon-180x105.jpg&quot; width=&quot;607&quot; /&gt;Researcher L.W. Cole works with a raccoon, 1905. Used with permission from Yale Library.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal experiments became one area of American expertise. Nonhuman subjects, by their very lack of language and inability to deceive in self-reports, were a perfect fit for a method based on external observation. The variety of species studied included the proverbial white rat, but many others as well. Although Yerkes spent three decades after World War I focused on primates, he had earlier measured learning in newts, frogs, mice, crows, and pigs. His colleague Edward Thorndike watched chicks, cats, and dogs escape from puzzle boxes, and Yerkes’s student L. W. Cole did the same with raccoons. So much scrutiny of animals expanded the researchers’ appreciation of their personalities. Intelligence, understood as skill acquisition, was the original question. Mood and temperament were annoyances. A tired rat knew where to find the bit of bread, but stopped running for it. It is not surprising that the emotions themselves eventually caught scientific interest. Donald Griffin rattled his field in &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://books.rupress.org/catalog/book/question-animal-awareness&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Question of Animal Awareness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 1976 when he declared, against reigning local wisdom, that animals are conscious. They have “not only images and intentions, but also feelings, desires, hopes, fears.” His revolutionary claim was the endpoint, however, of a typical American career. Three decades before, Griffin discovered how bats maneuver in the dark by echolocation, a kind of intelligence. His wonder at the animal mind deepened over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, American scientists never had a monopoly on insight into animal behavior. The counterexample of Darwin is enough to deflate any sense of supremacy. Their enthusiasm for controlled animal experiments produced so many competent studies, however, that they may have had an outsized influence. One British book of 1915, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~assets.cambridge.org/97811076/26560/excerpt/9781107626560_excerpt.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investigation of Mind in Animals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by E. M. Smith, borrowed nearly all of its illustrations from American publications. Although the Americans favored laboratory work for its rigor, they increasingly went into the field to witness the vast number of species in native habitats. Yerkes traveled to Senegal in 1929 in pursuit of great apes, and Griffin to Venezuela in 1952 to observe the nocturnal navigation of oilbirds. Often welcomed as respected authorities, they were also exposed to the world’s problems. Walter Cannon of Harvard celebrated “free intellectual intercourse without respect to national boundaries” in his plenary speech at the International Physiological Congress in Leningrad in 1935, published by the state press as &lt;em&gt;Chemical Transmission of Nerve Impulses&lt;/em&gt;. His trip by train from Vladivostok to reach the meeting, however, was a sobering political lesson. Seeing prisoners laboring at gunpoint along the tracks in Siberia made for “a queer kind of horror that seizes you now and then,” his wife Cornelia wrote of the trip. Cannon may well not have had immediate doubts about the virtues of his own country, but he surely registered the pressures of nationalism at the borders of science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;398&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Scientist-180x122.jpg&quot; width=&quot;587&quot; /&gt;Scientist C. R. Carpenter setting up equipment in Thailand in 1937 to record gibbon calls. Used with permission from Penn State Library.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;World War II fully exposed the catastrophic cost of national arrogance. International science advanced in its wake. Supported by American colleagues, Mayr achieved US citizenship in 1950 after a decade of government surveillance as a suspect alien. Although the new politics of internationalism was influential, just as crucial was the internal dynamic of science to push its practitioners beyond parochialism. The same high standard that impelled these Americans to apprehend animals in all their complexity–including animal emotions–underwrote growing internationalism. Precisely because the American science of animal behavior was embedded in political life, it had the power to change minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured image from &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/gorilla-monkey-animal-zoo-furry-3606809/&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-surprising-scientific-value-of-national-bias/&quot;&gt;The surprising scientific value of national bias&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620767382/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620767382/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620767382/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620767382/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620767382/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620767382/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fRacoon-180x105.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620767382/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620767382/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620767382/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620767382/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-importance-of-character-during-war/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The importance of character during war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/why-we-like-a-good-robot-story-2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why we like a good robot story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-we-can-equip-ourselves-against-climate-change/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How we can equip ourselves against climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psycholinguists have taken a scientific approach to the creation of new swear words, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/building-the-perfect-profanity&quot;&gt;reports Neuroskeptic&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers identified the ideal words to pair with profanities in order to come up with colourful new insults. Sticking &lt;em&gt;-pig&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;-mouth&lt;/em&gt; to the end of your favoured swear word will probably have the desired effect, according to the work, while adding &lt;em&gt;-newspaper&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;-fireplace&lt;/em&gt; could leave your insult falling flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39424&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sense of smell is arguably the least appreciated of all our senses&lt;/strong&gt;. But despite this “anti-olfactory prejudice” we have a lot to learn about human perception from studying smell, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/why-might-it-be-easier-to-fool-your-eyes-than-your-nose&quot;&gt;argues Ann-Sophie Barwich&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Aeon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are two kinds of bird that make their home in cities: big-brained birds that have few offspring, and small-brained ones that breed often. &lt;/strong&gt;That’s according to a recent study &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/city-birds-big-brained-with-few-offspring-or-small-brained-with-a-lot/&quot;&gt;covered in a podcast&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;. Birds with more brain power have an advantage when it comes to finding food and avoiding dangers. But for those with small brains, &lt;span&gt;like pigeons,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; producing plenty of offspring means that the population can still survive even if some individuals die.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it about social media that seems to make us so angry? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/why-social-media-makes-us-so-angry-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/&quot;&gt;Amy Fleming explores the research&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The former chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs has called for psychedelic drugs like psilocybin to be rescheduled, to make it easier to conduct scientific research on them&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/02/ease-rules-on-use-of-psychedelic-drugs-in-research-urges-david-nutt?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter&quot;&gt;reports Nicola Davis&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. In an article in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30282-8#%20&quot;&gt;David Nutt and colleagues review&lt;/a&gt; recent evidence on the potential benefits of psychedelics for treating mental health disorders. But they also write that classifying the drugs as “Schedule 1” substances — meaning they have no medical value — makes it costly and more difficult to conduct this kind of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And finally, in psychology-related coronavirus coverage this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At &lt;em&gt;The Conversation, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-why-clapping-for-carers-feels-so-strangely-uplifting-135092&quot;&gt;Catherine Loveday explains why&lt;/a&gt; clapping with our neighbours in support of NHS workers was so uplifting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your life is feeling surreal right now, you’re not alone. Sudden change, a loss of routine, and being thrown into a completely new experience can all contribute to that sense of otherworldliness, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/why-life-during-a-pandemic-feels-so-surreal/&quot;&gt;writes Matt Simon&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How might the pandemic shift our norms, behaviours and attitudes? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200401-covid-19-how-fear-of-coronavirus-is-changing-our-psychology?ocid=ww.social.link.twitter&quot;&gt;David Robson explores the possibilities&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At &lt;em&gt;UnHerd&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://unherd.com/2020/03/dont-trust-the-psychologists-on-coronavirus/&quot;&gt;Stuart Ritchie argues&lt;/a&gt; that in the current crisis, psychologists need to avoid giving unhelpful advice based on the results of small lab studies that may not generalise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<link href="https://xcorr.net/2020/04/02/scraping-webpages-with-developer-tools-and-selenium/"/>

		<updated>2020-04-02T16:41:42+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of interesting statistics you can do by scraping websites, whether it’s reading tables from Wikipedia, grabbing and aggregating climate change tables from government websites, or quantifying the exponential growth of covid-19 articles on Medium. Many of these pages will have easy-to-use methods to download the data in a develop-friendly format, for example CSV or JSON. For others, you’ll have to rely on scraping web pages, an ancient, dark art. In this article, I’ll introduce you to some of the tools of the trade to do so in Python.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Identifying targets with developer tools&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both Chrome and Firefox have developer tools (Shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+I). These tools allow you:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visualize the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS behind a webpage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;See the traffic between your browser and the internet, include late http requests triggered by JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Execute custom JavaScript that can read and modify the DOM of a webpage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify where a particular UI element is created in the page’s HTML&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These can help you identify which part of a page you need to scrape. Let’s say, for instance, that we want to find out how the top article of a major news website changes as a function of time during a time of crisis (as of now, covid-19). Perhaps we’ll want to retroactively run an analysis of the sentiment behind the headline, the focus (health, business, etc.), the frequency of updates, or of how these headers co-vary with numbers released by different governments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here I’ll use the New York Times as the example webpage. What we’d like is to grab, every half-hour, the title of the biggest headline. With developer tools, I can easily use the Picker tool (Ctrl+Shift+C) to highlight the biggest headline on the page.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7487&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7487&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;scraping&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;3070,1752&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/scraping/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here I find that the biggest headline is a &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; with a class name of &lt;code&gt;balancedHeadline&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s look at how we can grab this information with Selenium.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Selenium: remote control browsers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.selenium.dev/&quot;&gt;The method I’ll showcase here uses Selenium&lt;/a&gt;: we use a headless browser (that is, an instance of Firefox or Chrome that’s running “invisibly”) that navigates to the website we care about. Once on the webpage, we can inject javascript, simulate clicks or manipulate the DOM to get to the information we need. This is a rather heavyweight solution compared to, say, using &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html&quot;&gt;urllib&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to grab the data and parsing it with &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/&quot;&gt;BeautifulSoup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. However, the big advantage we get is that the headless browser actually runs the javascript on the page and loads all the extra assets – it’s literally like a person navigating to the website. Sometimes, it can be the only solution, especially if the information we need:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;is dynamically loaded&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;is hidden behind authentication layers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;requires emulating clicks and interacting with JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Python, we can easily install Selenium with:`&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;pip install selenium&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then we’ll need to install a WebDriver – this will allow your favorite web browser to be manipulated via Python. Here I installed the Firefox webdriver on the Ubuntu platform. &lt;a href=&quot;https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html&quot;&gt;I followed the instructions here on the Selenium website,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases&quot;&gt;downloading the gecko webdriver&lt;/a&gt; and extracting the binary to &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt;. You can check that you’ve done the installation by running a tiny bit of Python:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: python; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')

&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Running this code opens up Firefox and navigates to the website. Notice the unusual appearance of the browser: the url bar is a different color than usual, and there’s a robot icon next to the address.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-style-default&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7477&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7477&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;nytimes-robot&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;2176,192&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/nytimes-robot/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=723&quot; /&gt;A remote-controlled version of Firefox&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can grab the information in at least a couple of ways: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We could inject some Javascript into the page and use   &lt;code&gt;document.querySelectorAll(&quot;span.balancedHeadline&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; to grab the headline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We could read the DOM to find the right span&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s use the second method:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: python; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, &quot;balancedHeadline&quot;))
)
print(element.text)
driver.quit()
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Running headless and automating&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the explicit window is useful for debugging, if you want to run this script every half-hour, you’ll want to run this in a headless browser. A headless browser doesn’t display a window, so it won’t pop up over your other windowsand capture your inputs. In addition, we’ll want to save the data to disk, which we can easily accomplish like so:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options

options = Options()
options.headless = True

driver = webdriver.Firefox(options=options)
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, &quot;balancedHeadline&quot;))
)
with open('/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/top_news.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('&quot;' + str(datetime.datetime.now()) + '&quot;,&quot;' + element.text + '&quot;\n')
driver.quit()
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Cron job&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All that’s left now is to set up a cron job to run this script every 15 minutes. First, we’ll need a shell file. We could run python directly, but I installed selenium inside of a special conda environment called &lt;code&gt;headless-browser&lt;/code&gt;, so my shell file activates this environment before, like so:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: bash; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
source /home/pmin/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
conda activate headless-browser &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
python /home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.py
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I saved this file as &lt;code&gt;/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.sh&lt;/code&gt;. Running  &lt;code&gt;crontab -e&lt;/code&gt;, I added an entry that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;# m h  dom mon dow   command
*/15 * * * * /home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.sh 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 /var/log/grab-headline.log
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://crontab.guru/&quot;&gt;You can use this website&lt;/a&gt; to figure out what incantations to give to cron for different schedules. I also captured any output or error into an error log. If you don’t want to have to leave your computer on all the time to do this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/creating&quot;&gt;you can run cron jobs inside of a cloud service&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A final tweak we’ll need to deal with is authenticating. Sometimes the website we’re trying to scrape requires us to be logged in. It’s possible for the headless browser to use the same cookies and credentials as the regular browser you use. To do so, you need to locate the name of the default profile in Firefox. Locate a directory that finished with &lt;code&gt;.default&lt;/code&gt; with:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;ls ~/.mozilla/firefox/
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In my case, I found a directory called &lt;code&gt;lasd74g9.default&lt;/code&gt;. Putting everything together, here’s my final script:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: python; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;import datetime

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options

options = Options()
options.headless = True

profile = profile = webdriver.FirefoxProfile(profile_directory='/home/pmin/.mozilla/firefox/lasd74g9.default')
driver = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_profile=profile, options=options)
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, &quot;balancedHeadline&quot;))
)
with open('/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grim_news.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('&quot;' + str(datetime.datetime.now()) + '&quot;,&quot;' + element.text + '&quot;\n')
driver.quit()

&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine going to sit in a room with a violent, imprisoned psychopath and having a chat about what you both like to eat. (It’s impossible not to think of liver, fava beans and Chianti, isn’t it….?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what one researcher did recently in Germany. But the purpose of &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-17706-001&quot;&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt;, reported in &lt;em&gt;Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t to gather data on criminal psychopaths’ dining preferences, but rather on how they make — or don’t make — eye contact during a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first study to explore psychopaths’ eye movements in a naturalistic setting. And it reveals that prisoners who scored highly on one aspect of psychopathy, in particular, were much less likely to look at the interviewer’s eyes. This finding not only helps with understanding how psychopathy develops, but also suggests that finding ways to encourage at-risk children to make more eye contact might be a useful intervention, argue Nina Gehrer at the University of Tübingen and her colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39418&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The team studied 30 men who had been convicted of serious crimes (including murder, rape and hostage-taking) and who were incarcerated in two institutions in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One researcher led all the interactions, which were divided into talking and listening stages. For one minute, the participant listened while the researcher talked about one of three neutral topics (eating habits/food, job/work or typical daily routine). Then, after a brief exchange on the topic, the second stage began: the participant talked for about a minute on the same topic. This was then repeated for the other two topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout both stages, the experimenter maintained eye contact (this was later verified by two independent raters). And at all times, the prisoner wore an eye-tracking headset. This allowed the team to monitor where they were looking while they were listening and talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of the study, the team divided the face into two sections: the eyes and the philtrum (the nose and mouth region). They then examined whether time spent looking at the eyes or philtrum correlated with the participants’ scores on the PCL-R, a standard psychopathy assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychopathy is generally thought to have four facets, or components: manipulating other people, affective impairments (deficits in feeling emotion and empathy and in showing remorse or guilt), having an erratic lifestyle and demonstrating antisocial behaviour. Each of these is measured within the PCL-R. And the team found that during both listening and talking, prisoners with higher affective psychopathy scores made less eye contact. “These results are in line with previous research suggesting impaired attention to social cues in psychopathy,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current theories about how psychopathy develops assume that a failure to view important social cues (from the eyes, especially) is a key factor. For children who go on to be diagnosed with psychopathy, there’s evidence that emotion-related impairments emerge early, in the form of callous unemotional traits. There’s some evidence that young children who pay less attention to other people’s eyes are more likely to develop these traits, the researchers note. Now that this link has been found for adult, criminal psychopaths, this suggests that eye contact, or rather a lack of it, could be important for understanding the development of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations to the study, however. The number of participants was quite small, and all were men. The researchers themselves call for a replication before any firm conclusions can be drawn. It will also be important to investigate whether it’s possible to fix this particular deficit in eye contact, and, if so, whether that reduces the risk of developing emotion-related problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To date, evidence for lasting changes in eye gaze through social attention bias modification training is still elusive,” they note. “Thus, these promising approaches and further opportunities that target impaired eye contact need to be further investigated and enhanced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-17706-001?CheckAccess=1&quot;&gt;Eye contact during live social interaction in incarcerated psychopathic offenders.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/snack-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health bodies have suggested that tobacco-style HWLs should be considered for application to alcohol and high calorie snack products. However, evidence for their potential usefulness in these contexts &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/jt52m/&quot;&gt;is limited&lt;/a&gt;, with prior research typically focusing on sugary drinks, or using smaller or less representative samples. This led us to run two large-scale studies in general populations to examine the potential effectiveness and acceptability of image-and-text HWLs on alcohol and snack foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our studies &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two separate online studies we asked participants to rate different image-and-text HWLs on alcoholic drinks (Alcohol study, with 5,528 participants) and energy-dense snacks (Food study, with 4,618 participants). To take part, participants for the Alcohol study had to consume either beer or wine at least once a week, &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11822 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/alcohol-157x300.png&quot; width=&quot;157&quot; /&gt;and in the Food study participants consumed biscuits, cake, crisps or chocolate at least once a week, and liked chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants viewed and rated one of 21 image-and-text HWLs on alcoholic drinks or one of 18 image-and-text HWLs on high calorie snacks. Just like on cigarette packs, the HWLs showed an image of a disease relating to excess consumption of alcohol or high calorie snacks, alongside a text warning statement. For Alcohol the diseases depicted were bowel, breast, liver and non-specified cancers, heart disease, liver cirrhosis and liver disease, while for Food, the conditions were bowel and non-specified cancers, heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked how afraid, worried, uncomfortable or disgusted the label made them feel, and to rate their desire to consume the labelled product. They were also asked how strongly they supported putting the HWL on alcoholic drinks or high calorie snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-11812&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/alcohol-200x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;Alcohol study: we found that HWLs on alcoholic drinks depicting bowel cancer were associated with the highest level of negative emotional arousal and the lowest desire to consume the product. They were also considered the least acceptable for use by participants. In general, few of the alcohol HWLs were considered acceptable, with only three out of 21 rated at least somewhat acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food study: HWLs on high-density snacks depicting bowel cancer, followed by those depicting non-specific cancer, were associated with the highest level of negative emotional arousal and lowest desire to consume the product, with those depicting bowel cancer again considered to be the least acceptable. HWLs on energy-dense snacks were judged on average more acceptable than those on alcohol, with 13 out of 18 snack HWLs rated as at least somewhat acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also conducted a content analysis of free-text comments that some participants provided at the end of the study. Two key themes emerged– the acceptability of HWLs on these products, and their perceived effectiveness. Within these themes, comments touched on several pertinent issues, including the believability of the labels, whether people would avoid looking at them or become desensitized to them, whether they were appropriate to use, and whether participants thought they would affect their thoughts or behaviours in relation to these products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, while a wide range of views were expressed, the majority of responses expressed negative views of the possible use of such labels. It is plausible, however, that those who chose to leave a comment at the end of the study were those with more extreme opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are our results surprising?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of potential effectiveness, we found that for both alcoholic drinks and high calorie snacks, HWLs describing bowel cancer evoked the strongest negative emotional reactions and resulted in the lowest desire to consume the product they were applied to. This is consistent with previous research on alcohol labeling which has found bowel-cancer HWLs to be particularly effective. It is notable that this is similarly the case in the context of snack foods, where to our knowledge these warnings have not been tested before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;HWLs describing bowel cancer evoked the strongest negative emotional reactions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11817 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/choc-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;The finding that HWLs may be judged to be relatively more acceptable to use on snack foods than on alcohol could appear surprising. This could be due to heightened public awareness of the health consequences of excess energy intake and obesity, particularly in children. The content analysis (albeit based on a small subset of participants) suggested a mainly negative reaction to these labels on these products. Again, this is perhaps not surprising given that the study sample were people who regularly consumed the target products, and interventions which affect us directly are usually less supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that labels depicting bowel cancer may have the greatest potential for reducing alcohol and snack food selection and consumption. However, while bowel cancer HWLs had the greatest impact on people, they were also rated as the least acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study could not, however, demonstrate whether these labels are likely effective in actually changing behavior. The studies did not include a measure of actual behavior, and there was no control group to compare against. The studies were also conducted online and responses may differ when HWLs are applied to physical products in real-world settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further experimental studies are now needed to directly assess the potential effectiveness of health warning labels to reduce selection and consumption of &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/rv2p6/&quot;&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/zyca2/&quot;&gt;energy-dense snacks&lt;/a&gt;. Studies in field and naturalistic laboratory settings will enable us to examine whether these labels are likely to be effective in real-world settings.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Anna Dumituru and Alex May will talk about their project named &quot;Cyberspecies Proximity&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyberspecies Proximity explores what it will mean to share our sidewalks, elevators and transport systems in close proximity with mobile intelligent robots. The work challenges audiences to confront the technological, ethical, and societal questions raised by the advent of urban socially-aware robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robotic artwork combines the way-finding technologies of delivery and maintenance robots with an ability to communicate non-verbally, and to manipulate our emotions through body-language. The robot is able to move around an exhibition space using a predefined map created using SLAM technology. It reacts and responds to the body language of audience members through a multi-layered face, skeleton and movement tracking algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small and fragile humanoid form is dressed in the clothes of a worker, its frail and insignificant body reminds us of the social groups that will be most affected by future automation. The robot’s head and hands are made from 3D printed grey PLA and it intentionally avoids categorisations of race and gender. The project forces us to consider issues of ownership of public spaces as well as the broader ethical implications of how we design robots and behave towards them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyberspecies Proximity is a project by Anna Dumitriu and Alex May, created in collaboration with the Human Robot Co-Mobility Project of the New Technologies Team at Schindler. The project was supported by a Vertigo STARTS Residency, and the artwork was programmed in C++ and FUGIO, the Open Source Visual Programming System created by Alex May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTICE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to current unusual circumstances, this Journal Club will be held online as a conference on 8COM0108-0000-2019 module. In order to attend, you must be a member of that module.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how high your &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/09/more-time-spent-abroad-increases-self-concept-clarity-confidence-in-and-clarity-about-who-you-are/&quot;&gt;self-confidence&lt;/a&gt;, it’s likely that you have certain traits you’d change given the opportunity: maybe you’d turn down your anxiety, feel more outgoing in company, or be a bit less lazy. One 2016 &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167216637840&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that 78% of people wanted to better embody at least one of the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, emotional stability, conscientiousness, agreeableness, or openness to experience), so the desire to change who you are is not uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But are we so keen to change how moral we are? That is, how concerned are we really about being a good or bad person? A new study &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619893078?journalCode=pssa&quot;&gt;published in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619893078?journalCode=pssa&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that we’d rather spend time improving those parts of us that aren’t morally relevant, with traits like honesty, compassion and fairness taking a back seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39410&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Jessie Sun from the University of California, Davis, and Geoffrey Goodwin from the University of Pennsylvania asked two groups comprising a total of 800 participants to fill in an online survey, in which they self-reported their personality traits. The first set of questions was based on the Big Five personality domains, while the second looked at moral traits, with questions measuring general morality as well as honesty, fairness, loyalty and purity. Participants also indicated how much they wanted to change on each of these personality and moral traits, responding to statements like “I want to be helpful and unselfish with others”, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants also nominated four “informants” who knew them well. These informants rated their friend’s traits and reported what changes they’d like to see in the friend’s personality and moral character. Informants also selected the top three changes they’d like to see in their friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants most wanted to change their non-moral personality traits, particularly those relating to negative emotions: they wanted to reduce anxiety, depression, emotional volatility and anger. Creativity, productivity and sociability were the most desired traits, while moral traits such as honesty, loyalty and fairness took a back seat. And, overall, participants showed a weaker desire to change moral traits than non-morally relevant personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This preference was even more striking when the researchers considered the top three desired changes for each participant. In one of the groups, 48% of participants reported that becoming less anxious was one of their top three priorities, with 44% wanting to become less depressed. Desire for increased sociability and productivity, and reduced emotional volatility, also commonly made it to the top. But moral improvements were not prioritised: a desire to become more compassionate made the top three goals of just 9% of participants, and only 3% counted a goal to become more generally moral among their top priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern also emerged across the participants’ “informants”, who also expressed very little desire to change their friends’ moral traits and were likely to select goals that closely matched those picked by participants . The informants also wanted their friends to change less than the participants did themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern of results didn’t just come about because participants already saw themselves as particularly moral, the researchers argue. Instead, some of it may be down to self-interest: we’re more motivated to change in ways that improve our own sense of well-being, in other words. Being less depressed has an obvious and immediate impact on our lives; being “more moral” does not come with such straightforward benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although self-interest doesn’t sound like a particularly noble motivator, the fact that friends also seemed to prioritise the participants’ personal well-being is somewhat more cheering. The friends seemed to choose desired changes not by how “good” or “bad” they were likely to make the target, but by how likely they were to make their life better or happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/29/belief-in-our-moral-superiority-is-the-most-irrational-self-enhancing-bias-of-all/&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has also suggested a supreme confidence in our own moral superiority: we frequently believe we are more honest and trustworthy than others. In some cases, this may be true. But we could also benefit from thinking harder about our possession of these qualities when it’s time for self-improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619893078?journalCode=pssa&quot;&gt;Do People Want to Be More Moral?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 It’s a bit like a slugger crediting Barry Bonds for help with his homerun swing. An anesthesiology journal has retracted a 2018 paper that cited three retracted papers by Yoshitaka Fujii, the record-holder for most retractions by a single author.  As we’ve written before, journals had a spotty record in reacting to the Fujii scandal, … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2020/04/01/zombie-papers-why-do-papers-by-the-most-prolific-fraudster-in-history-keep-getting-cited/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Zombie papers: Why do papers by the most prolific fraudster in history keep getting cited?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/Biology_blog-image_1-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp_orcid_field&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://orcid.org/orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;From its launch in 2003, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; quickly established itself as PLOS’ flagship journal in the life sciences–a model of Open Access and a catalyst for change in scholarly publishing as well as a leading publication for the life sciences. Today, we’re announcing the beginning of a new vision for the journal which builds upon its earlier successes and pushes boundaries even further to promote Open Science and excellence in publishing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We had considered holding back this announcement while so many of us are grappling with the impact of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. However, we view it as our duty as publishers, now and in the long term, to accelerate the path to publication and increase transparent research practices. We believe the changes to the scope and new article types on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;outlined below, will help researchers in the life sciences rapidly share their early findings and preregister their studies, and may prove to be particularly useful in these difficult times.. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To lead this new phase for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, we are also fortunate to welcome a talented and passionate new Editor-in-Chief, Nonia Pariente. Welcome, Nonia! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/Nonia_new-Bio-editor.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Nonia Pariente, PLOS Biology Editor-in-Chief&quot; class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-42876 size-thumbnail&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/Nonia_new-Bio-editor-150x150.png&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“I’m very excited to take on this new role. PLOS Biology has a very strong reputation and an inspiring vision. I am passionate about broadening its reach to all of the Life Sciences communities and strengthening its position in the publishing landscape. All important advances in every area of biology should feel they have a home in PLOS Biology”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px;&quot;&gt;— Nonia Pariente, PLOS Biology Editor-in-Chief&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pushing Boundaries in Service of Research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;When the journal launched, Open Access was an experimental publishing option. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; proved that being highly selective and Open Access were perfectly compatible, aligning all the benefits of immediate and global accessibility with impactful research. Our aim has always been to challenge the status quo in scientific communication in order to better meet researchers’ needs. With our past experience to guide us, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; is setting up a framework for assessment and publication that better aligns with the process of scientific inquiry itself, including:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Redefined selectivity criteria which will emphasize the importance of the research question and the quality of its execution; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A preregistration option offering peer review of the study design, with guaranteed publication of the final research article–regardless of the results–for accepted protocols;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Introduction of two linked article types, Discovery Reports and Update Articles, which enable researchers to report on ongoing work as their research develops and new information becomes available.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Combined with the existing criteria around openness of research data, a preprint deposition workflow, and the option for authors to publish their peer review history, these changes are part of PLOS’ larger goals to transform scientific communication in a way that empowers researchers to choose Open Science. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Surfacing the importance of the entire research process, not just results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As we’ve reflected on more than fifteen years of experience at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, and considered the publishing landscape, we acknowledge that publishing in highly selective journals remains an imperative for many researchers. The typical criteria used to select articles, however, continue to focus on novelty and perceived importance of the research results. As such, they continue to nurture a perverse system of incentives in which it matters to be first and to have an exciting headline–much less to be right and to have results that stand robustly to the test of time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;has already started addressing this challenge by giving a premium to transparency and access to underlying data, methodology and reagents, to enhance reproducibility. By introducing its ‘scooping policy’ through which novelty is not a disqualifying criteria within six months of an initial report. By opening up its peer review process to give context to decisions, as well as publishing valuable studies with clearly stated caveats when the consensus among reviewers is unclear. And even by asking authors to remove speculative results to reduce the hype that they sometimes feel pressured to provide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; will remain a selective journal–don’t take me wrong. But in its selection process, the journal now seeks to more systematically emphasize the importance of the research question and the quality of its approach and execution, before considering the importance of the results. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The new preregistration workflow, in addition to all the benefits it offers for reducing bias in experimentation and reporting, is also meant to encourage researchers to undertake important and well-designed studies with uncertain outcomes instead of censoring their research ideas based on the odds of publication. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The new linked article types will allow researchers to share their work more quickly, and to more effectively separate exploratory research during which they generate hypotheses (to be published as a Discovery Report) from its confirmatory phases, during which the hypothesis is further tested and new insights generated (to be linked as an Update Article). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome, Nonia Pariente!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Of course, none of this would be possible without a strong underlying editorial strategy. Joining our highly experienced team of staff editors, Nonia officially came on board earlier this month as Editor-in-Chief and is eager to get started on these new initiatives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“Since I started editing, and definitely as I have grown throughout my career as Chief Editor of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and now as Editor-in-Chief of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, my goal has been to help science advance and to help scientists communicate their stories… I think what makes PLOS Biology and PLOS in general stand out is that it is an organization that was founded with the goal and drive to innovate the process of scientific publication for the benefit of scientists and scientific advance. Thinking outside the box is almost an obligation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Please take a moment to get to know Nonia through her introduction on the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/biologue/2020/03/31/meet-plos-biologys-new-editor-in-chief-nonia-pariente/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Biologue blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, and read more about her vision for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; in her &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000707&quot;&gt;Editorial&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The scope and importance of this work is really too big for one post, so our team will be providing more details over the next few weeks with updates to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/biologue/&quot;&gt;this space&lt;/a&gt;. These new article types are immediately available to submitting authors and you can find more details on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/journal-information&quot;&gt;Journal Information&lt;/a&gt; page of our site.

 &lt;p&gt;Today &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; added to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://collections.plos.org/&quot;&gt;collection&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 papers since we started &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/&quot;&gt;fast-tracking submissions on January 31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230405&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was conducted by Constantinos Siettos from the Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Italy and colleagues. The authors used the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model with data between January 11 and February 10, 2020 and estimated key epidemiological parameters up until February 29. With these parameters, they forecasted that between 80,000 and 160,000 people would be infected by February 29 – in fact, around 84,000 are known to have become infected in this time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Siettos notes, “This is the first study based on a mathematical modelling approach that has provided relatively accurate three- week-ahead forecasts. Importantly, to the best of our knowledge this is the first study based on a mathematical modelling approach suggesting that the actual number of the infections in the total population is of the order of twenty times more than those reported, and that the mortality rate in the total population is about ~0.15% i.e. significantly less than reported 2-3%.Our findings imply that for the case of Hubei (with a 60m population), around 2%-3% of the total population in Hubei has been actually infected by coronavirus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science leaders have &lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/covid19-open-access-letter.pdf&quot;&gt;recently requested&lt;/a&gt; that the publishing community make their content open and re-usable. PLOS &lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/publishers-make-coronavirus-covid-19-content-freely-available-and-reusable&quot;&gt;already supports&lt;/a&gt;, and calls on others to support, COVID-19 research being shared such that it can be centrally text- and data-mined, and also versioned in places where it can be most conveniently discovered by those tackling this crisis in real time. We always push &lt;u&gt;all &lt;/u&gt;PLOS content to PubMed Central. We are also forwarding all of our submissions to the World Health Organization for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov&quot;&gt;database of publications on coronavirus disease (COVID-19)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are  compiling all our Coronavirus-related papers into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://collections.plos.org/&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/a&gt; as they publish. We encourage all researchers investigating pressing issues like disease outbreaks to also consider posting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/why-preprint&quot;&gt;Preprint&lt;/a&gt;.  You can find the most recent preprints relating to the coronavirus outbreak – posted across bioRxiv and medRxiv on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/search/title%3Acoronovirus%2Bwuhan%2B2019-nCoV%20title_flags%3Amatch-any%20jcode%3Amedrxiv%7C%7Cbiorxiv%20numresults%3A10%20sort%3Arelevance-rank%20format_result%3Astandard&quot;&gt;search link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/sweets-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are your kids addicted to sugar? &lt;/em&gt;Children between the ages of 2 and 18 should eat less than six teaspoons of added sugar per day on average. This adds up to around &lt;strong&gt;25 grams&lt;/strong&gt; of sugar. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england&quot;&gt;Public Health England&lt;/a&gt; (PHE) children consume much more sugar than recommended; this equals around eight excess sugar cubes a day or &lt;strong&gt;2,800 excess&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;sugar&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;cubes&lt;/strong&gt; per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has instigated the ‘sugar smart’ campaign led by PHE which is aimed at raising awareness of the amount of sugars in foods and drinks and to encourage parents to reduce their children’s sugar consumption. ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/change4life&quot;&gt;Change4life&lt;/a&gt;‘ is England’s first national social marketing campaign, promoting the following the slogan “Eat Well, Move More, Live Longer”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Change4Life Sugar Smart campaign was launched on January 4th 2016. TV, billboard and digital advertising ran for six weeks to support the campaign. A Sugar Smart app was available for parents to download free of charge. The app enabled users to scan barcodes on food and drink packaging to find out how many grams of total sugars were contained in the product; depicted in sugar cubes, to help consumers visualize the amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-8422-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;A recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; aimed to determine whether the campaign was effective in altering dietary behavior, by assessing any impact of the campaign on sugar intake among children aged 5-11 years. This included looking into the parental perceptions of the campaign and exploring barriers related to reducing sugar intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents/guardians were asked to report their child’s dietary intake; telephone interviews were also conducted. This covered a range of topics including understanding of the general change4life message, the impact of sugar on health and family and social barriers experienced whilst trying to reduce children’s sugar intake. Findings indicate that parents often feel confused over the difference between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“[The children] thought because they couldn’t have sugar, they couldn’t have fruit and it was saying that sugar was bad, so we had to sort of explain that it’s not all bad; it’s just different types.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the campaign, many parents reported that they tried to switch out unhealthy food for a healthier version and reducing portion sizes, however, the largest barrier included time constraints due to a fast paced life style and the easy availability of sweet treats which led to increased leniency; for example, pudding at school or temptation in the local supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You get tired and sometimes you go, “oh, just eat it then”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall it was found that the health marketing campaign raised awareness of sugar in food and drinks in both parents and children, impacting food consumption in families. Sugar smart campaigns are likely to have a positive influence on reducing sugar consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Targeting the parents:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study concludes that a health marketing campaign aimed at both parents and children has a positive impact in reducing sugar intake, however, reductions in sugars are not always sustained long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents want to reduce their child’s sugar intake, but societal barriers as well as confusion over aspects of the diet to change often hamper efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the campaign was successful in raising awareness amongst both parents and children. The findings suggest that further education is required when it comes to different types of sugar and food labeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future campaigns should continue to target the parents, which in turn will have a knock on effect on reducing sugar consumption in the young. In the future campaigns should focus on combatting long term sugar reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At least since the philosophers of ancient Greece, scholars have pointed out the analogy between madness (psychosis) and dreaming…” So begins a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230212&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;PLoS One&lt;/em&gt;, that seems to shore up that analogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreams and psychotic hallucinations do have things in common. They both feature perceptual sensations that seem real, but which are conjured up by our brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are also differences. While dreams are known to be highly visual, psychotic hallucinations are primarily auditory. They generally involve hearing things that aren’t real rather than seeing things that don’t exist. And this difference is an important reason why “the idea of dreaming as a model for psychosis has remained speculative and controversial,” write Roar Fosse of the Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, Norway, and Frank Larøi of the Norwegian Centre of Excellence for Mental Disorders Research at the University of Oslo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to date, there’s been very little investigation into perceptions of sounds in dreams, the pair reports. And now they have data suggesting that, in fact, auditory perceptions are common. If this is the case, the links between psychotic experiences and dreams may be stronger than has been recently supposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39407&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Fosse and Larøi used social networks and a psychology group on Facebook to recruit 13 people who reported having good dream recall, but no psychiatric disorders or any other condition. Neither did they report taking any medication that might affect their sleep. The group consisted of 12 women and one man (with a mean age of 28).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were asked to keep a dream diary: to write down any dreams they could recall that had taken place just prior to awakening from sleep, and to keep doing this until they each had records for 10 dreams. They were told to record the detail of any dream, whether or not it featured sounds. But at the same time, they were asked to focus on any auditory content, and describe this in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that sounds featured often, being reported in 80% to 100% of each participant’s dreams. Most often, the sounds consisted of other people speaking. (There were even five instances described as speech in a foreign language that the dreamer did not understand.) But there were also 122 instances of the dreamer speaking and 59 instances of other types of sound, such as glass breaking, gun shots, people walking or running, and a radio playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Considering that dream reports include experiences from only the last minutes of sleep before awakening, and that dreaming normally takes place throughout REM sleep as well as in light NREM sleep, the available evidence suggests that normal, healthy people usually experience internally generated auditory sensations an array of times every night,” the researchers conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certainly some limitations to the study. This was a small group of almost all women who self-reported having good dream recall and who volunteered for the study — so may not represent the broader population. Also, rather than being regularly woken and asked what they were dreaming about, they only reported dreams when they woke spontaneously. Earlier work has found that such dreams tend to be more dramatic. So the content that they reported may not be typical of dreams experienced throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the findings are intriguing, and hint at all kinds of interesting work to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some parallels between the normal sleep wake cycle and theories about how psychotic hallucinations come about. As someone falls asleep and moves through early sleep stages into REM, there’s a general decrease in reflective, directed thought and a gradual increase in internally-generated perceptions. Theories of psychotic hallucinations, meanwhile, propose that an impairment in higher order, “top-down” regions (typically in the prefrontal cortex) allows for more internally-generated, sensory-like hallucinatory experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also some recent evidence suggesting similarities in the neurophysiological underpinnings of both dreams and psychotic hallucinations. Both states are associated with similar alterations in dopamine functioning and patterns of connectivity between certain regions of the cortex, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could possibly be an “intrinsic property of the brain-mind system” that reduced or compromised higher order cognitive, executive control facilitates both dream hallucinations and psychotic hallucinations, the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, though thinking about dreams and psychosis has a long history, it’s early days for this as a scientific field. More research will be needed to explore whether there really are meaningful, common underlying connections between the two states, or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230212&quot;&gt;Quantifying auditory impressions in dreams in order to assess the relevance of dreaming as a model for psychosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 In the market for an admirably clear and concise retraction notice?

		<link href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620581304/0/oupblogpsychology/"/>

		<updated>2020-03-31T09:30:13+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;Graduate education, particularly the training of doctoral students, plays crucial role in the progress of society. Around 1,500 of the country’s 4,500 or so universities award doctoral degrees. In 2018 according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf20301/data-tables/&quot;&gt;Survey of Earned Doctorates &lt;/a&gt;55,185 students were doctorate recipients in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To match potential graduate students and graduate programs needs the interplay among students, college professors as evaluators, and admission committees.  Many academics are involved in the admission process of graduate students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a college professor, it’s my seasonal duty each fall to write letters of recommendation and rate students based on several criteria in order to help them gain acceptance to graduate schools. Students should ask several professors to evaluate them. Occasionally, I have to tell a student that I would not be able to write a strong recommendation, so it would be better not to ask me. We evaluators combine quasi-objective data (say, grades) and subjective impressions to generate a rating score. Despite the subjective nature, these evaluations are far from random, and college professors don’t have better ways of helping students and graduate programs find a good match.   At the individual level, rating and ranking of application to graduate schools dramatically influences the life of students. Admissions committees have a strong interest in ensuring they only accept mature, polite, reliable, and stable people into their program, and my professional duty is to help them achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One company provides software as a service to many universities for admissions and applications evaluations. Its software uses six criteria to rate students:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowledge in chosen field&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Motivation and perseverance toward goals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to work independently&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to express thoughts in speech and writing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability/potential for college teaching&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to plan and conduct research&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each criterion, the evaluator picks among five options: exceptional (upper 5%), outstanding (nxt 15%), very good (next 15%), good (next 15%), and okay (next 50%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we generate the numbers and check the appropriate rubric? In principle, a micro-rationalist, bottom-up approach would work. Teachers could collect and store data from students throughout decades, and they might have a formal algorithm for calculating the percentages. I believe it is more likely that many of us apply top-down strategies. We ask ourselves:  do I want to grant a set of grades that is all exceptional? Does the applicant have a clear weak point, in which I should check the third or maybe the fourth category? What if I score, say,  four outstanding and two exceptional?  The table below shows an example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;288&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EOQ4yPK5dd0-180x76.jpg&quot; width=&quot;682&quot; /&gt;Image credit: Peter Érdi&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought this student should be supported, because she seemed to be very motivated, independent and clever. However, I have never checked anybody to be “exceptional” in all categories. First, nobody is exceptional in everything, second, it would be suspicious if my scores were unfair and consciously biased, and so it might be counterproductive. In the case shown in the figure the candidate had little experience in her chosen field, so I checked the second column. Probably the third or even the fourth column would have been more appropriate. I did not feel I was cheating, but I knew I was a little biased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good or bad, decision makers calculate the sum of the scores, analyze their distribution, read the recommendations, and adopt some strategies to bring  decisions. (In some version of the ranking game, weights are assigned to the different features, to expressing the relative importance of the different features. University ranking systems  famously assign relative percentage weights to each ranking factors .) While rating with numbers contains subjective elements, we don’t have better ways to approximate objectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion of objective reality refers to anything that exists as it is independently of any conscious awareness or perceiver. Subjective reality is related to anything that depends upon some conscious awareness or some perceiver. Objectivity is associated with concepts like reality, truth, and reliability. Objectively ranking the tallest buildings in the world is relatively easy, since it is based on verifiable facts, and we have a result that everybody will accept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we accept that it is an impossible task to objectively ranking graduate students, what we could and should do? On the one hand, we could improve our ranking methodologies, on the other hand we (all stakeholders of the game from students to professors) should feel that our actions are as fair as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image by Joshua Golde from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/qIu77BsFdds&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-to-rate-and-rank-potential-doctoral-students/&quot;&gt;How to rate and rank potential doctoral students&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620581304/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620581304/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fEOQ4yPK5dd0-180x76.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/why-we-like-a-good-robot-story-2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why we like a good robot story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/its-time-for-the-government-to-introduce-food-rationing/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;It’s time for the government to introduce food rationing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-importance-of-character-during-war/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The importance of character during war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, arXiv now offers a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/covid19search&quot;&gt;quick search link to all coronavirus and COVID-19 research&lt;/a&gt; hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org&quot;&gt;arXiv.org&lt;/a&gt;. The search results are sorted by date, with the most recent papers at the top of the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also new on the arXiv homepage is an external link to&lt;a href=&quot;https://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/181&quot;&gt; medRxiv and bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt; preprints about the coronavirus and COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_589&quot; style=&quot;width: 430px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/03/arxiv-covid-19-quick-links.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;arXiv COVID-19 quick links as seen on home page&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-589&quot; height=&quot;116&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/03/arxiv-covid-19-quick-links-300x81.png&quot; width=&quot;430&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;COVID-19 quick links as seen on home page&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In times like this, we need global collaboration in research and shared knowledge among different disciplines,” says Eleonora Presani, arXiv Executive Director. “arXiv allows researchers from different backgrounds and geographical locations to quickly share their findings and push forward for the discoveries we need. It is an ideal platform for researchers to communicate with each other when speed is of extreme importance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a free, fast, and open access scholarly research distribution service, arXiv accelerates the pace at which science can advance. And online communication is particularly relevant now, with researchers around the world isolated due to travel restrictions and conference cancellations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the context of a pandemic like the one we’re experiencing, it is crucial to get information to people quickly, and arXiv provides a shared infrastructure and community to get scientific research to those that can make a difference,” says Greg Morrisett, Jack and Rilla Neafsey Dean and Vice Provost of&lt;a href=&quot;http://tech.cornell.edu&quot;&gt; Cornell Tech&lt;/a&gt;. “Already, there are preprints on topics ranging from genomic structure of the virus to epidemiological studies to projected economic impacts, and from every corner of the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new quick search link will expedite efficient research discovery, says Steinn Sigurdsson, arXiv Scientific Director. “Within arXiv, research on the coronavirus, associated clinical syndromes, and epidemiology is spread across multiple disciplines and tagged with a number of different keywords. In the interest of expediency, we are providing a direct curated link to e-prints with the most commonly used tags.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other preprint servers, arXiv does not facilitate in-depth peer-review and does not specifically endorse the contents of the documents it hosts. Results on &lt;a href=&quot;http://arXiv.org&quot;&gt;arXiv.org&lt;/a&gt; should be considered preliminary and not used to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior. Likewise, such findings should not be reported in the news media as established information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official coronavirus and COVID-19 health information, policies, and resources for the general public can be found at the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019&quot;&gt; World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; and the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html&quot;&gt; Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking up is never easy, particularly when you’re confronted with memories of happier times. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/18/trouble-sleeping-the-scent-of-your-lover-might-help/&quot;&gt;smell&lt;/a&gt;, an old photograph, a note somebody left you — weeks or even months after a break-up and you can still be reminded of your ex-partner, whether you like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On social media, this can be even worse. If you’re still friends with your ex, you’re likely to still see their posts on your feed; if you’re not, you can still rub salt into the wound by checking their profile anyway. ‘On this Day’ features are also notoriously bad for bringing up unhappy memories at the worst possible time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359172&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;published in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, &lt;/em&gt;we also see our exes so much because of the so-called “social periphery” — the networks of people we know tangentially through our ex-partners&lt;span&gt;. So why not design an algorithm that causes us less pain? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The new work suggests that this could be the answer to our online break-up woes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39396&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The study, conducted by Anthony Pinter and colleagues at the University of Colorado Boulder, focused on 19 adult Facebook users based in the US. Semi-structured interviews were held with each of the users on their feelings around break-ups and social media. Each had been in a relationship prior to the interview — either dating, cohabiting, or marriage — and were aged between 19 and 46.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants described a range of experiences in which they came into contact with their ex-partners online, from anything between six days to five years after the break-up. They were then asked to focus on specific features that could stop them from coming across their ex — unfriending or unfollowing, for example, or changing the way they view their newsfeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, emotions ran high. Participants reported feeling pained by seeing content involving their ex-partners, whether that was new information (such as an ex’s new relationship status) or past memories (such as anniversary posts or photographs). “The most upsetting thing on Facebook is On This Day,” one participant said. “It said I was the best husband ever and she loved me the most… I remember that, and obviously not physically being hurt, but just feeling an emotional wallop of like ‘Fuck, that wasn’t that long ago’”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all fairly unexpected: unwanted contact with an ex-partner is obviously going to be difficult in some regard. But while the problem may be well-established and familiar, there could still be a novel response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, the authors argue, is that machine learning has focused on methods that “fail to capture social nuances, relationships and other human-centred concerns” — in other words, that the algorithms present to us an unnatural or unhelpful model of our social relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are workarounds when it comes to existing platforms — unfriending, unfollowing or blocking ex-partners, or opting out of features like ‘On This Day’. But because of the social periphery, distant connections still linger after a break-up: one participant talked of their ex-partner’s mother’s frequent appearance on their feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being clear about what will happen when you mute or block someone is a good first step. But such fixes, the authors believe, are far from perfect. It’s the algorithms themselves that need changing, taking into consideration our complex social peripheries as well as our one-to-one connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, algorithms mainly take notice of binary connections — how much or little we choose to see from one particular person. By tweaking these algorithms to take into consideration not only peripheral &lt;em&gt;relationships&lt;/em&gt; but also events, interests, photos and groups could mean our social periphery is both better represented online and easier to evade post-break up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complexities of such encounters should also be taken into consideration. It’s unlikely to matter if an ex has clicked ‘attending’ on a large event that spans multiple days or takes place in multiple locations, so seeing that they’ve done so may cause unnecessary pain. Knowing they’re likely to attend a small gathering of friends, however, may be more useful information if you’re keen to avoid an awkward meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When, or if, algorithms become more human-focused, we may find ourselves having less stressful interactions with our ex-partners online. Blocking and unfriending might not be perfect, but at the moment may be the next best thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359172&quot;&gt;“Am I Never Going to Be Free of All This Crap?”: Upsetting Encounters with Algorithmically Curated Content About Ex-Partners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Large droplets were thought to contaminate the area immediately surrounding an infected individual, because they settle before evaporating. In contrast, small  droplets evaporate quickly and form residual particulates, or aerosols. However, the classification of droplet size (and therefore the mode of transmission) is not based on modern science. Yet this scheme still informs public health policy to this day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The figure above shows a Multiphase Turbulent Gas Cloud From a Human Sneeze (&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852&quot;&gt;Bourouiba, 2020&lt;/a&gt;).

On a more scientific note, it's true that the COVID-19 symptom of coughing isn't as violent as sneezing. However:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;droplets of diameter 30 µm can have a horizontal range of up 2.5 m away from the cougher due to cloud dynamics.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RtS0PQhiofM/Xn-XgrDNUBI/AAAAAAAANE0/NyJhDDiCaqMUO8ZnrKen-e1br0Yk_zPQgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/height%2Band%2Bdistance%2Bfrom%2Bcougher_Fig%2B18b.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;398&quot; data-original-width=&quot;474&quot; height=&quot;268&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RtS0PQhiofM/Xn-XgrDNUBI/AAAAAAAANE0/NyJhDDiCaqMUO8ZnrKen-e1br0Yk_zPQgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/height%2Band%2Bdistance%2Bfrom%2Bcougher_Fig%2B18b.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig. 18b (&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/violent-expiratory-events-on-coughing-and-sneezing/475FCFCBD32C7DB6C1E49476DB7A7446&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Violent expiratory events: on coughing and sneezing&quot;&gt;Bourouiba et al., 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bourouiba L (2020). &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Turbulent Gas Clouds and Respiratory Pathogen Emissions: Potential Implications for Reducing Transmission of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;JAMA&lt;/i&gt; March 26.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granville-Chapman J, Dunn RL.

 &quot;No single agency has provided the public with an accurate, up-to-date record of coronavirus cases, tracked to the county level. To fill the gap, The New York Times has launched a round-the-clock effort to tally every known coronavirus case in the United States.

 &lt;p&gt;As school closures and quarantines take place across the globe, the overwhelming anxiety is palpable in the newfound realities of a pandemic. Trips to the grocery store are now strategized, as shoppers face empty shelves and shortages of household staples. This will undoubtably continue as anxiety thrives on uncertainty increasing stress and driving us to seek answers and information in an evolving landscape. Keeping ourselves healthy and safe is a tall order and is further compounded by the challenge of maintaining our values and goals as parents. Still, it is vital that we support ourselves as individuals first, because maintaining our mental and physical health is the foundation from which we support our children during these trying times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First and foremost – plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than ever, it is important to follow the warnings and guidelines of trusted resources. This includes the WHO, state and local governments, and public health agencies. For personal advice, turn to your doctor and your child’s pediatrician. Websites, including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.healthychildren.org/&quot;&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, are another source of trusted information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disconnect to reconnect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After keeping up to date with developments in the pandemic, schedule time to disconnect from the consumption of social media and news outlets. Being bombarded with information fuels panic and inhibits preparedness. Further, media consumption turns you away from face-to-face interactions with your partner/spouse and children leading to missed opportunities for connection and comfort. By imposing limits, we can model how to manage our handling of difficult information, and also limit our child’s exposure to anxiety ridden media and social media content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, take this hibernation as an opportunity to recharge and strengthen bonds as a family. The forced decluttering of our schedules allows us to foster one-on-one interactions, a sense of togetherness, and protects us from anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain your foundation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undoubtably routines, habits, and daily activities are disrupted by cancellations in schools, activities, and events. These disruptions are unavoidable, unnerving, and trigger negative emotions that may stray us away from essential self-care routines needed to support our health and mental health. Self-care takes many forms including daily mediation practice, home-based hobbies (such as cooking/baking, gardening, redecorating, channeling your inner Marie Kondo), exercise, crafting or sewing, writing, art, collecting, reading, etc. By taking care of yourself first you are fueling your ability to care for others and minimizing your vulnerability to illness, irritability, and anxiety – all of which draw you away from mindful parenting. For example, I have committed to starting each day with a yoga practice and ending many days with a meditation practice. These few quiet moments ensure that no matter how much arguing my kids do (with myself or each other), I reduce my vulnerability to stray from my parenting goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reconnect with natural joys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exercise and nature are pillars for maintaining our health and mental health, making them an essential part of our daily routine. Vitamin D, daily exposure to the elements, and physical activity help maintain our health, ensure better sleep, and protect us from negative moods. This is also a great way to pass time with kids or grab a few moments of needed solitude. This can be as simple as doing daily activities outside such as meals, reading, work, and schoolwork or more adventurous such as exploring your neighborhood or local hiking paths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice gratitude and altruism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reflecting on the gifts of today is an essential element of happiness and contentment. And while it is easy to ruminate on our loss of freedom and normalcy, focusing on the negative only perpetuates despair. Although it may not be automatic, taking a few minutes each day to mindfully list things you are thankful for will change your perspective and increase your sense of well-being. The practice of gratitude is also great for the whole family, allowing children to focusing on the positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for helping others in a time of need. Can you run errands for your elderly neighbor? Or help organize activities for kids and share them with other parents? Take this opportunity to sort out old toys, books, and clothes and make donations to charity? By helping others, we strengthen our sense of belonging and gain a sense of community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know when to seek help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, as you and your family will undoubtably experience anxiety during the coming days and weeks it is important to know when and where to seek help. Panic will only fuel impulsive behavior, reduce intelligent decision making, and increase our vulnerability. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America has compiled &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://adaa.org/finding-help/coronavirus-anxiety-helpful-resources&quot;&gt;a list of trusted resources&lt;/a&gt; and expert tips. Taking care of your mental health is a vital part of ensuring that your kids and teens navigate this time successfully. We know from well-established scientific studies that children’s mental health improves when parents seek mental health care first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/mother-little-son-sitting-windowsill_6632009.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;by prostooleh via Freepik&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/a-guide-to-parent-self-care-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/&quot;&gt;A guide to parent self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620455710/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620455710/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/the-story-of-covid-19-by-the-numbers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The story of COVID-19, by the numbers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/why-covid-19-could-change-how-we-work/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why COVID-19 could change how we work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-city-will-survive-coronavirus/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The city will survive coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Reverse correlation is a tried-and-tested nonlinear systems identification method to understand biological neurons. The idea is to open the black box that is a biological neuron by using random stimuli to probe how the neuron responds. We present a series of random stimuli to a sensory neuron. By averaging those that generated a response, we obtain the spike-triggered average. The spike-triggered average is equal to the weights of a linear filter that approximates the response of a neuron. Under this linearity assumption, it is also a neuron’s preferred stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reverse correlation has fallen out of favour as people have graduated to more complex models (e.g. GLMs and deep nets) with more complex stimuli (natural scenes) to probe brain representations. However, the machinery underlying reverse correlation is making somewhat of an unexpected comeback in different corners of machine learning. This is something that I’m sure will surprise many machine learning people as well as neuroscientists. Digging deeper into these subfields yields some insights on improvements in nonlinear systems identification that we can take back to computational neuroscience. In this article, I discuss two of these ideas:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;evolution strategies, which are black-box optimization methods&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;locally interpretable models, which are linearization models to open up black box models like deep neural nets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before I dig into these methods, let’s dig into the theory behind reverse correlation so we can understand its deep structure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;The theory behind reverse correlation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reverse correlation seemed pretty magical when I first encountered it! Put noise into a system, measure responses – out comes the kernel (?!). I ended up &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/thesis-superduperfinal.pdf&quot;&gt;writing my PhD thesis on systems identification&lt;/a&gt;, so you’d think that by the time I graduated my thinking on this was solidified. In the years since, I’ve found that reverse correlation is actually pretty darn subtle, and I’ve developed a new appreciation for all the subtle aspects of the technique.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a good exposition of the ideas behind reverse correlation in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/neco.2006.18.12.3097&quot;&gt;Franz &amp;amp; Schölkopf (2006)&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s say that we are trying to characterize a nonlinear system that receives &lt;img alt=&quot;N&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;N&quot; /&gt; real inputs and outputs a noisy scalar &lt;img alt=&quot;y&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;y&quot; /&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\mathbb E [y|x] = f(\bold x) \newline \text{where } \bold x \in \mathbb R^N&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+E+%5By%7Cx%5D+%3D+f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%5Cnewline+%5Ctext%7Bwhere+%7D+%5Cbold+x+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb+R%5EN&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\mathbb E [y|x] = f(\bold x) \newline \text{where } \bold x \in \mathbb R^N&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, under certain regularity conditions, we can write the mean response function of the system &lt;img alt=&quot;f(\bold x)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;f(\bold x)&quot; /&gt; as a polynomial expansion, the Volterra expansion:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;f(\bold x) \approx h_0 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T \cdot h_1 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T h_2 (\bold x - \bold x_0) + \ldots&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%5Capprox+h_0+%2B+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29%5ET+%5Ccdot+h_1+%2B+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29%5ET+h_2+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29+%2B+%5Cldots&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;f(\bold x) \approx h_0 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T \cdot h_1 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T h_2 (\bold x - \bold x_0) + \ldots&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note that the kernels &lt;img alt=&quot;h_i&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_i&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;h_i&quot; /&gt; have increasing order: &lt;img alt=&quot;h_0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;h_0&quot; /&gt; is a scalar, &lt;img alt=&quot;h_1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;h_1&quot; /&gt; a vector, &lt;img alt=&quot;h_2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;h_2&quot; /&gt; a matrix, &lt;img alt=&quot;h_3&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_3&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;h_3&quot; /&gt; a three-index tensor, etc. The form of the expansion is similar to a Taylor expansion, and it’s tempting to identify the two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misconception: the Volterra expansion is a Taylor expansion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Volterra expansion is more general than a Taylor expansion: a Taylor expansion requires well-defined derivatives to every order, while a Volterra expansion does not. For example, the function &lt;img alt=&quot;f(x) = \exp(-1/x^2)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29+%3D+%5Cexp%28-1%2Fx%5E2%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;f(x) = \exp(-1/x^2)&quot; /&gt; has 0 derivatives everywhere. Hence, its Taylor expansion around 0 is exactly 0. However, it has a perfectly good non-null Volterra expansion, which can be found through polynomial regression. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Expansion-Schmexpansion.ipynb&quot;&gt;Here’s a notebook that shows you how it’s done&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Approximating a function with zero derivatives with a Volterra expansion&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/volterra2.png&quot; /&gt;Approximating a function with a null Taylor series with polynomials.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This subtle difference might seem like some nit-picking, but in practice, it is very important: discontinuous functions and stochastic functions can both be approximated with Volterra series. Biological Neurons are both stochastic and have potentially very sharp nonlinearities, yet we can still approximate them using a Volterra expansion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wiener expansion is an orthogonalized version of the Volterra expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To estimate the coefficients of the Volterra expansion, conventional reverse correlation first rearranges the Volterra expansion into an equivalent series of functionals, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_series&quot;&gt;Wiener expansion&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;f(\bold x) = \sum_i G_i[\bold x]&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%3D+%5Csum_i+G_i%5B%5Cbold+x%5D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;f(\bold x) = \sum_i G_i[\bold x]&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And imposes that these functionals are orthogonal to each other:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\mathbb E_D[G_i(x)G_j(x)] = 0 \text{ for } i \ne j&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+E_D%5BG_i%28x%29G_j%28x%29%5D+%3D+0+%5Ctext%7B+for+%7D+i+%5Cne+j&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\mathbb E_D[G_i(x)G_j(x)] = 0 \text{ for } i \ne j&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;img alt=&quot;D&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;D&quot; /&gt; is the data distribution. Orthogonality is imposed via a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;img alt=&quot;G_0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_0&quot; /&gt; to the output of the Volterra kernel of order 0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;img alt=&quot;G_1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_1&quot; /&gt; to the output of the Volterra kernel of order 1, and back-project &lt;img alt=&quot;G_0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_0&quot; /&gt; from &lt;img alt=&quot;G_1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_1&quot; /&gt; to make &lt;img alt=&quot;G_1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_1&quot; /&gt; orthogonal to &lt;img alt=&quot;G_0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;img alt=&quot;G_2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_2&quot; /&gt; to the output of the Volterra kernel of order 2, and back-project &lt;img alt=&quot;G_0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_0&quot; /&gt; and &lt;img alt=&quot;G_1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_1&quot; /&gt; from &lt;img alt=&quot;G_2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_2&quot; /&gt; to make &lt;img alt=&quot;G_2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_2&quot; /&gt; orthogonal to both, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the itty-bitty subtle bit: it turns out that the expectations of every order are straightforward to calculate when the data distribution &lt;img alt=&quot;D&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;D&quot; /&gt; is normal. The 0’th order and 1st order functionals are simply the constant and linear Volterra kernels. The 2nd order functional is the quadratic kernel minus a correction for the diagonal terms of the kernel, since the square of a normally-distributed variable distribution has a mean equal to the square of the standard deviation, &lt;img alt=&quot;\mathbb E[x^2] = \sigma^2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+E%5Bx%5E2%5D+%3D+%5Csigma%5E2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\mathbb E[x^2] = \sigma^2&quot; /&gt;. Thus:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;G_0 = k_0 \newline G_1 = (x - x_0)^T k_1 \newline G_2 = (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) - \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj}\newline&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0+%3D+k_0+%5Cnewline+G_1+%3D+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_1+%5Cnewline+G_2+%3D+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_2+%28x+-+x_0%29+-+%5Csigma%5E2+%5Csum_j+k_2%5E%7Bjj%7D%5Cnewline&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_0 = k_0 \newline G_1 = (x - x_0)^T k_1 \newline G_2 = (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) - \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj}\newline&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since each functional are orthogonal over the data distribution, we can easily calculate them using an iterative procedure:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Estimate the Wiener kernel &lt;img alt=&quot;k_0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;k_0&quot; /&gt; from the measured response &lt;img alt=&quot;y&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;y&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Project the 0’th order functional out of &lt;img alt=&quot;y&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;y&quot; /&gt; to obtain &lt;img alt=&quot;y_{res}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bres%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;y_{res}&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Estimate the Wiener kernel &lt;img alt=&quot;k_1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;k_1&quot; /&gt; from the residual &lt;img alt=&quot;y_{res}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bres%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;y_{res}&quot; /&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimating Wiener series with white noise means finding estimates that minimize sum-of-squares between prediction and measurement over the stimulus ensemble. We use a few shortcuts enabled by properties of white noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What does &lt;em&gt;estimate&lt;/em&gt; mean in this context? Least-squares! To estimate the zero-order kernel, we have:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\hat k_0 = \arg \min_{k_0} \sum(y - k_0)^2 = \bar y&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat+k_0+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bk_0%7D+%5Csum%28y+-+k_0%29%5E2+%3D+%5Cbar+y&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\hat k_0 = \arg \min_{k_0} \sum(y - k_0)^2 = \bar y&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first-order kernel:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\hat k_1 = \arg \min_{k_1} \sum(y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T k_1 )^2 \newline = ((x - x_0)^T (x-x_0))^{-1} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y) \newline \approx \frac{1}{N \sigma^2} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat+k_1+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bk_1%7D+%5Csum%28y+-+%5Cbar+y+-+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_1+%29%5E2+%5Cnewline+%3D+%28%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+%28x-x_0%29%29%5E%7B-1%7D+%28x-x_0%29%5ET+%28y+-+%5Cbar+y%29+%5Cnewline+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN+%5Csigma%5E2%7D+%28x-x_0%29%5ET+%28y+-+%5Cbar+y%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\hat k_1 = \arg \min_{k_1} \sum(y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T k_1 )^2 \newline = ((x - x_0)^T (x-x_0))^{-1} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y) \newline \approx \frac{1}{N \sigma^2} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here the approximate sign comes from the fact that with normally distributed data, &lt;img alt=&quot;(x - x_0)^T (x-x_0) \approx N\sigma^2 I&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+%28x-x_0%29+%5Capprox+N%5Csigma%5E2+I&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;(x - x_0)^T (x-x_0) \approx N\sigma^2 I&quot; /&gt;. The second order kernel is a little more tricky. We first define &lt;img alt=&quot;r = y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+y+-+%5Cbar+y+-+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;r = y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T&quot; /&gt;. Then:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;k_2 = \arg \min_{k_2} \sum \left(r - (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) + \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj} \right)^2 \newline = \text{unstack}((D^T D)^{-1} D^T r) \newline&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_2+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bk_2%7D+%5Csum+%5Cleft%28r+-+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_2+%28x+-+x_0%29+%2B+%5Csigma%5E2+%5Csum_j+k_2%5E%7Bjj%7D+%5Cright%29%5E2+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Ctext%7Bunstack%7D%28%28D%5ET+D%29%5E%7B-1%7D+D%5ET+r%29+%5Cnewline&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;k_2 = \arg \min_{k_2} \sum \left(r - (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) + \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj} \right)^2 \newline = \text{unstack}((D^T D)^{-1} D^T r) \newline&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The columns of the matrix &lt;img alt=&quot;D&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;D&quot; /&gt; is composed of all the cross-products &lt;img alt=&quot;x_i x_j - \delta_{ij} \sigma^2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i+x_j+-+%5Cdelta_%7Bij%7D+%5Csigma%5E2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;x_i x_j - \delta_{ij} \sigma^2&quot; /&gt; for &lt;img alt=&quot;i \ge j&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cge+j&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;i \ge j&quot; /&gt;. The operator &lt;img alt=&quot;\text{unstack}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7Bunstack%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\text{unstack}&quot; /&gt; takes this linear representation of the coefficients and transforms them into a matrix. Here again, we find that for normally distributed inputs, the non-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix &lt;img alt=&quot;D^TD&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%5ETD&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;D^TD&quot; /&gt; have an expected value of zero. The inverse of the diagonal is a bit more tricky to calculate, but a little bit of grinding shows that we pick up a scalar factor &lt;img alt=&quot;\frac{1}{2!\sigma^{4}}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%21%5Csigma%5E%7B4%7D%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\frac{1}{2!\sigma^{4}}&quot; /&gt;. In fact, we can show that the estimate of the kernels can be written as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;k_i(j_1, j_2, \ldots j_i) = \frac{1}{i!\sigma^{2i}N} [y - \sum_{m=0}^{i-1} G_m(\mathbf x)] x_{j_1} x_{j_2} \ldots x_{j_i}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_i%28j_1%2C+j_2%2C+%5Cldots+j_i%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bi%21%5Csigma%5E%7B2i%7DN%7D+%5By+-+%5Csum_%7Bm%3D0%7D%5E%7Bi-1%7D+G_m%28%5Cmathbf+x%29%5D+x_%7Bj_1%7D+x_%7Bj_2%7D+%5Cldots+x_%7Bj_i%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;k_i(j_1, j_2, \ldots j_i) = \frac{1}{i!\sigma^{2i}N} [y - \sum_{m=0}^{i-1} G_m(\mathbf x)] x_{j_1} x_{j_2} \ldots x_{j_i}&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;img alt=&quot;G_j&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_j&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_j&quot; /&gt; are the orthogonalized Wiener functionals (equation 2, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3382067&quot;&gt;Korenberg et al. 1988&lt;/a&gt;). Notice the &lt;img alt=&quot;i!&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%21&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;i!&quot; /&gt; factors, which look an awful lot like a Taylor expansion. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Second-order-estimate.ipynb&quot;&gt;This formula actually works! Here’s a notebook to show you how it’s done for a second order Wiener expansion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Is your head spinning yet? Mine sure was! Grinding through the kernels one by one makes a few things clear:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wiener-Volterra analysis isn’t magic. It’s orthogonal polynomial regression estimated through least-squares, with approximations that are enabled by the use of a very special distribution of the inputs, the normal distribution. This means that expectations of different moments can be analytically calculated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Wiener kernel definitions change when you change the distribution of the input. This is because orthogonalization is dependent on the input distribution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The easy estimation of the kernels via backprojection and simple multiplication with cross-products of the inputs is lost when the input distribution is not normal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The special properties of white noise were very important technically in 1958 when the series was proposed: the kernels could be estimated with very minimal computing resources. A memoryless accumulator is sufficient. Today, we’re no longer bound by these limitations, and we can do Wiener-Volterra analysis in a much wider range of contexts. Casting Wiener-Volterra analysis as polynomial regression fit via least-squares immediately opens up many extensions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finding better estimates via the minimum variance unbiased estimator, that is, maximum likelihood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finding better estimates by better modeling the noise, for example, taking into account the Poisson nature of neural noise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generalizing to non-normally distributed ensembles of inputs, again using maximum likelihood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using alternative expansions, for example, cascades of linear-nonlinear filters (i.e. deep nets), fit with stochastic gradient descent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, some of the ideas behind Wiener-Volterra theory – local polynomial expansion, probing stimuli at random – have made their way into far-flung machine learning methods. Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Evolution strategies (ES)&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Evolution_strategies&quot;&gt;Evolution strategies&lt;/a&gt; (ES) are a family of black-box, gradient-free optimizers for potentially non-differentiable functions. At the heart of most optimizers over continuous variables is the computation of the gradient. If the gradient is unaccessible because of discontinuities, or because it is very expensive to calculate, we can obtain a &lt;em&gt;smoothed&lt;/em&gt; gradient via the ES method.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The setup is quite clever. We have a function &lt;img alt=&quot;f&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;f&quot; /&gt; that we are trying to optimize. Instead of computing its derivative &lt;img alt=&quot;\nabla f(z)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+f%28z%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\nabla f(z)&quot; /&gt; directly, we compute the derivative of the expectation of the function, &lt;img alt=&quot;\mathbb \nabla \mathbb E_\pi[f(z)]&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+%5Cnabla+%5Cmathbb+E_%5Cpi%5Bf%28z%29%5D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\mathbb \nabla \mathbb E_\pi[f(z)]&quot; /&gt; in a local neighborhood &lt;img alt=&quot;\pi(\theta, z)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%28%5Ctheta%2C+z%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\pi(\theta, z)&quot; /&gt;. Think of this expectation as a smoothed derivative.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To compute the expected value, we expand it via its definition, and obtain:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\nabla_\theta \mathbb E_\pi(z, \theta)[f(z)] = \nabla \int \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \log \pi(z, \theta) \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla_%5Ctheta+%5Cmathbb+E_%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%5Bf%28z%29%5D+%3D+%5Cnabla+%5Cint+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cint+%5Cnabla+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cint+%5Cnabla+%5Clog+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\nabla_\theta \mathbb E_\pi(z, \theta)[f(z)] = \nabla \int \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \log \pi(z, \theta) \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The last equality, which is also called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.shakirm.com/2015/11/machine-learning-trick-of-the-day-5-log-derivative-trick/&quot;&gt;log-derivative trick&lt;/a&gt;, is derived from:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\nabla \log \pi(z,\theta) = \frac{\nabla \pi(z, \theta)}{\pi(z, \theta)}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+%5Clog+%5Cpi%28z%2C%5Ctheta%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cnabla+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%7D%7B%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\nabla \log \pi(z,\theta) = \frac{\nabla \pi(z, \theta)}{\pi(z, \theta)}&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A neighbourhood which is often used in practice is the isotropic Gaussian centered at $\mu$ with a standard deviation $\sigma$. If we take a Monte Carlo estimate of the expectation, we find an approximation for the gradient as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\nabla \mathbb E[f] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \nabla_\mu \log N(\mu, \sigma^2) \newline = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \frac{1}{\sigma^2} (z-\mu) f(z)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+%5Cmathbb+E%5Bf%5D+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN%7D+%5Csum_%7B1%7D%5EN+%5Cnabla_%5Cmu+%5Clog+N%28%5Cmu%2C+%5Csigma%5E2%29+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN%7D+%5Csum_%7B1%7D%5EN+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7D+%28z-%5Cmu%29+f%28z%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\nabla \mathbb E[f] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \nabla_\mu \log N(\mu, \sigma^2) \newline = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \frac{1}{\sigma^2} (z-\mu) f(z)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice this remarkable equation: this is exactly the response-triggered average with an isotropic gaussian stimulus ensemble. This reveals an unexpected link between reverse correlation and optimization: we can view reverse correlation as estimating an approximate gradient of the response function of a neuron.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The response-triggered average tells us how we should change a stimulus locally to increase the response of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Taking ES to reverse correlation&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;From the OpenAI blog, https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/es.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies/&quot;&gt;From the OpenAI blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The unexpected link between reverse correlation and optimization opens up a lot of different avenues. For instance, we could adapt ES to maximize the response of a neuron in a closed-loop fashion. This strategy has the advantage of being trivial to compute and highly intuitive (i.e. no complaints from reviewer 2 about the method being inscrutable).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ES is also embarrassingly parallel, which has been used to good effect in the context of reinforcement learning – OpenAI showcased ES with 1024 parallel evaluations. We could consider evaluating the gradient of a neuron’s response function in parallel with several other neurons – perhaps in a different animal, in a different lab – and optimize for a stimulus that maximizes the sum of the responses. Indeed, we don’t have to focus on maximizing just the mean response of a neuron: we can maximize the diversity of responses, their dimensionality, etc. This works as long as the metric that we’re measuring is a scalar function of the measured responses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ES comes in a variety of different flavours that aim to increase the efficiency of the method. Two of the most popular variants are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES&quot;&gt;CMA-ES (Covariance-matrix-adaptation)&lt;/a&gt;. This takes the derivative of the neighborhood with respect to the covariance of the normal distribution, in addition to its mean. Thus, the covariance stimulus ensemble is tweaked to capture the largest dimensions of descent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/wierstra14a.html&quot;&gt;NES (Natural evolution strategies)&lt;/a&gt;. This uses natural gradients rather than gradients, which naturally deals with rescaling of the axes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both of these more efficient variants could be applied to find preferred stimuli in a population of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, because the ES objective is a Monte Carlo estimate, we can import many of the tricks from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_reduction&quot;&gt;variance reduction literature&lt;/a&gt; to increase the efficiency of reverse correlation. For example, we can use control variates or use stratified sampling strategies. My favourite trick to increase the efficiency of estimation: pairing every stimulus with its negative. With this trick, the mean of the realized stimulus ensemble is exactly the mean of the distribution. &lt;a href=&quot;https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Paired-sampling.ipynb&quot;&gt;This antithetic sampling can, in some circumstances, increase the efficiency of the estimation of the preferred stimulus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Locally interpretable models&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s another area where the ideas underlying reverse correlation have recently come together: &lt;a href=&quot;https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/lime.html&quot;&gt;locally interpretable models&lt;/a&gt;. Suppose that we have a complex black-box model that we are trying to better understand. This black box model can be, for example, a deep neural network. We can locally approximate this complex function with a simpler, local expansion. This local explanation does not capture all the subtleties of the model, but it can reveal insights that are useful for humans that want to understand the model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black-box models are good for predictions by machines. White-box models are good for understanding by humans. LIME transforms black-box models into locally white-box models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Toy example to present intuition for LIME.The black-box model’s complex decision function f(unknown to LIME) is represented by the blue/pinkbackground, which cannot be approximated well bya linear model. The bold red cross is the instancebeing explained. LIME samples instances, gets pre-dictions using f, and weighs them by the proximityto the instance being explained (represented hereby size). The dashed line is the learned explanationthat is locally (but not globally) faithful. From Ribeiro et al. 2016&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/lime-caption.png&quot; /&gt;From the LIME paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938&quot;&gt;Ribeiro et al. 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In general, we try to find a model &lt;img alt=&quot;g&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;g&quot; /&gt; which approximates a complex function &lt;img alt=&quot;f&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;f&quot; /&gt; according to a weight window &lt;img alt=&quot;\pi&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\pi&quot; /&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\arg \min_{g\in G} L(f, g, \pi) + \Omega(g)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bg%5Cin+G%7D+L%28f%2C+g%2C+%5Cpi%29+%2B+%5COmega%28g%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\arg \min_{g\in G} L(f, g, \pi) + \Omega(g)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;img alt=&quot;L&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;L&quot; /&gt; is a loss function and &lt;img alt=&quot;\Omega(g)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28g%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\Omega(g)&quot; /&gt; captures the complexity of &lt;img alt=&quot;g&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;g&quot; /&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=7315&amp;amp;action=edit&quot;&gt;In LIME, or locally interpretable model explanations&lt;/a&gt;, the authors suggest to use a Gaussian-shaped neighborhood around an anchor &lt;img alt=&quot;a&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;a&quot; /&gt;, and a sum-of-squares loss, leading to the weighted loss:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;L = \sum_i \exp \left(-\frac{||x_i - a||^2}{\sigma^2} \right) (f(x_i) - g(x_i)) ^ 2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L+%3D+%5Csum_i+%5Cexp+%5Cleft%28-%5Cfrac%7B%7C%7Cx_i+-+a%7C%7C%5E2%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7D+%5Cright%29+%28f%28x_i%29+-+g%28x_i%29%29+%5E+2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;L = \sum_i \exp \left(-\frac{||x_i - a||^2}{\sigma^2} \right) (f(x_i) - g(x_i)) ^ 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several choices are possible for &lt;img alt=&quot;\Omega(g)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28g%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\Omega(g)&quot; /&gt;. For example, we may privilege functions that focus on few input dimensions; we can impose that &lt;img alt=&quot;g&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;g&quot; /&gt; is sparse in parameter space using an L1 penalty as &lt;img alt=&quot;\Omega(g)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28g%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\Omega(g)&quot; /&gt;. The model class &lt;img alt=&quot;G&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G&quot; /&gt; can be anything that is “easy to interpret” for humans. This could mean:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a GAM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a decision tree&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a linear model&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we choose no penalty for complexity and choose a linear model class, our model and error function is equivalent to reverse correlation and evolutionary strategies. This highlight something that’s underappreciated about reverse correlation:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spike-triggered average is a simplified, locally valid explanation for how a neuron works. While complex models like deep nets can capture more of the variance in the data, the goal in reverse correlation is different: explaining neurons to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Taking LIME to reverse correlation&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An underappreciated fact about reverse correlation is that the size of the neighbourhood around which we’re linearizing is arbitrary and that different neighbourhoods will lead to different estimates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many articles have documented that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/31/6991.short&quot;&gt;receptive fields appear to change with changing stimulus ensembles&lt;/a&gt;, for example natural vs. artificial stimuli. However, this has been explained in terms of a special, adaptive response of neurons to natural image statistics; for instance, that they increase the degree of feedforward inhibition they receive. In fact, the same phenomenon could happen simply because we’re measuring a nonlinear function, so that its locally linear expansion depends on the stimulus ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of the parameters of the probing distribution are arbitrary:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the size of the neighborhood (big vs. small)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the shape of the neighborhood (isotropic Gaussian vs. non-isotropic vs. natural stimuli)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the center of the neighborhood (gray image or another reference)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the most interesting applications of nonlinear systems identification have manipulated each of these factors. For example, by shifting the center of the neighbourhood to an appropriate anchor point, we can locally linearize quadratic responses (i.e. complex cells) by choosing an appropriate anchor point. This is the idea behind Movshon et al. (1978), where the line weighting function of a complex cell is found by using another line in the center as an anchor:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Local linearization of receptive fields&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/movshon-1978.png&quot; /&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1113/jphysiol.1978.sp012489&quot;&gt;Movshon et al. 1978&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are some other excellent nuggets in the LIME paper that could serve us well. For instance, they suggest using a maximally diverse ensemble of examples (SP-LIME) to illustrate the functioning of the models to humans. &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10589&quot;&gt;A similar idea was used in Cadena et al. (2018) to visualize diverse features&lt;/a&gt; that triggered large responses in early stages of a deep neural net around an anchor point (invariant or equivariant features).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can have our cake and eat it too: we can fit very complex models of neurons that explain much of the variance in sensory systems using deep nets, and visualize how these models work using locally linear explanations. It sounds a little silly to fit a model to a model, but it’s a technique that has been used fruitfully both to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/109/16/E972.short&quot;&gt;explain sensory neurons&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531&quot;&gt;compress neural networks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both ES and LIME use local linearization strategies similar to reverse correlation to explain complex black box function. From ES, we learn that the reverse correlation estimate gives us a local approximation for the gradient, which can be used as a starting point for closed-loop experiments. From LIME, we see that we can perform reverse correlation centered around different neighbourhoods, yielding different results. By following these new research trends in machine learning, we can find innovative ways of opening the black boxes that are biological neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

 A co-editor of the Journal of Neurology has retracted a 2018 paper he helped write because the way the paper was written misled readers about the nature of the research.  The article, “Menière’s disease: combined pharmacotherapy with betahistine and the MAO-B inhibitor selegiline—an observational study,” purported to describe the effects of a combination treatment to … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2020/03/27/a-german-vocabulary-lesson-paper-retracted-because-an-individuelle-heilversuche-is-not-a-clinical-trial/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;A German vocabulary lesson: Paper retracted because an “individuelle Heilversuche” is not a clinical trial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/IS098TI3W-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the Cesarean section (CS) &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2689-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;rate has been increasing&lt;/a&gt; with the main reason being a woman’s prior CS history. Trial of labor after Cesarean (TOLAC), with the aim of achieving vaginal birth rather than repeat CS, is considered a safe and reasonable option. However, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14662227&quot;&gt;rate of TOLAC is decreasing&lt;/a&gt;, especially in Japan, and most women who are eligible for TOLAC choose elective repeat Cesarean delivery (ERCD) without receiving detailed information about the merit of TOLAC. Obstetricians who do not offer the option of TOLAC underline for these women that TOLAC is a “dangerous” option even though the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1440-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;risk of uterine rupture&lt;/a&gt; is around 0.5% and ERCD has also a variety of complications, in contrast to successful TOLAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been thinking that the patient’s decision, rather than the doctor’s, is the most important to improve success rate of TOLAC. Therefore, we have performed a prospective study based on women’s decisions after receiving a detailed explanation of the risks and benefits of both TOLAC and ERCD. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-2833-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Our new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showed promising results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our criteria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our TOLAC criteria, which are based on earlier studies, are shown in Table 1.  For pregnant women who met all these TOLAC criteria, we explained the risks and benefits of both TOLAC and ERCD with detailed documents, at 32 weeks of gestation. The documents about TOLAC included the risks of uterine rupture which occurs in around 0.5% of women, which is much higher than that of ERCD, and carries a risk of mortality for the fetus and/or the mother. On the other hand, ERCD has higher risks of bleeding, infection, thrombosis, and complication of subsequent pregnancies. The women in our study could choose their delivery mode after counseling on these risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table 1. Criteria for TOLAC in this study&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;height: 447px;&quot; width=&quot;573&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;1) only one previous Cesarean delivery&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;2) former Cesarean delivery was a low transverse Cesarean&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;3) no obstetric contraindications for vaginal delivery&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;3) singleton pregnancy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;4) vertex presentation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;5) no history of myomectomy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;6) in general, no medical induction of labor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;7) well informed on the risks of TOLAC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We screened 1,086 pregnant women for eligibility and 735 met the above criteria. Of these, 64.1% opted for TOLAC. Earlier studies also showed the same rate, which means that if women receive sufficient education and support, they tend to choose TOLAC as their desirable mode of delivery. Obstetricians should understand this fact and should not underline only the risk of rare complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High success rate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study had a rate of successful TOLAC (vaginal birth) of 91.3%, similar to the vaginal birth rate of women who have no history of Cesarean, with the rate of uterine rupture being 0.6%. There were no infant deaths or long-term sequelae among all 471 TOLAC attempts. Apgar scores of &amp;lt;7 at 5 minutes, which is a marker of fetal asphyxia, did not significantly differ between the two groups. Women with history of vaginal birth in addition to a prior CS had a high chance of successful TOLAC (96.4%), and when labor spontaneously occurred before 40 weeks of gestation, the success rate was favorable (97.6%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have shown that TOLAC can be considered a reasonable means of birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have tried to reveal the reasons for this high success rate and showed that in the successful TOLAC group, 70.5% of women had a previous CS without labor due to non-recurrent indications, including breech presentation, placenta previa, severe preeclampsia, or suspected cephalopelvic disproportion. On the other hand, over 40% of women who chose repeat ERCD had a previous CS that followed unsuccessful labor due to indications such as labor arrest disorders or non-reassuring fetal status (p&amp;lt;0.01). We believe these differences may have positively impacted the TOLAC success rate, partly because unsuitable candidates may have self-excluded from the TOLAC group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factors associated with failed TOLAC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study revealed that factors related to failed TOLAC included ≥40 weeks of gestation and prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM). After 40 weeks of gestation, success rates decreased (from 97.6% to 76.9%). Half of failed TOLAC cases experienced PROM. Until now, there have been limited studies into the impact of PROM on TOLAC. Obstetricians should be encouraged to have ongoing discussions with women about their mode of delivery after the due date or PROM, as these may be indications to change from planned TOLAC to ERCD. Ongoing discussions throughout pregnancy are important for preventing complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have shown that TOLAC can be considered a reasonable means of birth not only for mothers but also for neonates, with over 60% of eligible women choosing TOLAC and over 90% of those achieving successful TOLAC. History of vaginal birth in addition to CS increased odds of successful TOLAC, while PROM or ≥40 weeks of gestation were risk factors for failed TOLAC. Obstetricians have to discuss the planned mode of birth throughout pregnancy in order to prevent complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our results we would recommend that mothers who have elected ERCD choose a date of CS later than 39 weeks of gestation as some studies suggest a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0803267&quot;&gt;risk of increased negative respiratory outcomes&lt;/a&gt; in elective CS before 39 weeks. If spontaneous labor occurs before the planned date of ERCD, these women could be encouraged to attempt TOLAC instead of emergency CS, because when labor spontaneously occurred before 40 weeks of gestation, the success rate of TOLAC was favorable.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Figure-1_Flattening-the-Curve-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closure of schools and offices has wreaked havoc on families. The cancellation of airline flights, public events, social functions, and the disruption of our economy has been exasperating. We have been thrown into an era dominated by uncertainty, anxiety, and fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are these measures truly necessary to mitigate the current COVID-19 pandemic? The answer is yes. With the lack of a preventive vaccine or definitive treatment for COVID-19, the only way to stop spread is by social distancing and “flattening the curve”. This previously unfamiliar expression is now part of the vernacular. Flattening the curve refers to reducing the number of cases to allow doctors, hospitals and government officials to function at their best without being overwhelmed. It is important to recognize that hospitals have only a finite number of rooms, ventilators and healthcare personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The info-graphic below demonstrates why slowing the spread of the infection is nearly as important as stopping it. While shaped differently, the 2 bell-shaped curves below represent the same number of infected patients. The y-axis or peak of the bell indicates the daily number of cases and the x-axis indicates the time since the first case. The dotted line across the center represents the point at which too many cases in a short period of time will overwhelm the healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large number of people becoming severely ill with COVID-19 over a short period of time as shown in the tall, narrow curve, could result in a shortage of hospital beds, equipment or doctors. On the other hand, as shown in the flatter, longer curve, if the same number of patients presented to the hospital at a slower rate, the likelihood of the hospital to have adequate supplies, beds and health care providers would be higher (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11795 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;343&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Figure-1_Flattening-the-Curve-300x166.jpg&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in order to mitigate the impact of this pandemic, we need to keep the number of cases to below the dotted line. By doing so, we let our healthcare system function at its best. This also allows time for scientists and researchers to create drugs, therapies and potentially an efficacious vaccine against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An especially important factor to consider with respect to flattening the curve, is the necessity to keep our healthcare workers–physicians, nurses, and hospital staff–healthy and safe. With an increasing number of cases in the community, the potential for this workforce to get sick is much higher. If healthcare workers become sick, they will need to be excluded from patient care for many weeks. This effect of this is profound, as it will result in less healthcare workers and less qualified individuals available to take care of the sickest COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social distancing may be our only hope to help flatten the curve and slow the spread of disease. Social distancing involves keeping a physical distance between people, at least 6 feet away, to avoid spread of the COVID-19 virus. This decreases the chances of acquisition of the virus and the disease. With the continued acceleration of this pandemic, no measure can be considered too drastic. The horrifying situation in Italy, wherein patients with COVID-19 have inundated the overburdened healthcare system, forcing doctors to make agonizing triage decisions about who should receive lifesaving care, should not be repeated in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School closures for the purpose of social distancing have especially impacted children and young families. Although current data suggests that children do not appear develop severe illness, it is well-documented that children can still spread the virus to their family members and contacts. Prior influenza pandemics have shown that the highest attack rates were seen in school children due to their close contact. Being separated from friends, can be difficult for children and especially teenagers. Social distancing does not mean social isolation. We can continue to interact using different platforms, such as social media and video applications to help them stay connected during this challenging time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an unprecedented time and although social distancing may be thought to be a dramatic measure, in truth, together as a unified society, we can help slow down the spread of COVID-19. By staying home, you are not just protecting yourself but also other people. It’s the responsible thing to do and although challenging, will help us avoid a situation similar to that of Italy wherein war-like triage decisions and death has become a commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is currently in an unprecedented state of upheaval and uncertainty. As countries fight to minimise the spread of COVID-19, everyone is adjusting to the “new normal”, remaining at home and practising social distancing. And the same is true of the psychologists whose work we report on every day at &lt;em&gt;Research Digest&lt;/em&gt;: labs have been shut and experiments have suddenly been put on hold in the wake of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many psychologists have also begun launching new research to understand how the present crisis is affecting us, and to inform our response to it. So this week, I’ve been talking to some of these researchers to find out more about their work.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39388&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring our mental health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that the new routines that we are now following are going to be necessary for quite some time. A new study led by social epidemiologist Daisy Fancourt is asking how people are responding to these changes in lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know that our mental health can be affected by isolation, says Fancourt, and there’s never been a situation where so many people have been required to remain physically separated from others. “We’ve not really had something like this in living history,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, the team is examining the trajectories of people’s mental health during the pandemic — and investigating what kinds of activities can help protect against the negative effects of isolation. Any UK resident over 18 can &lt;a href=&quot;https://redcap.idhs.ucl.ac.uk/surveys/?s=TTXKND8JMK&quot;&gt;sign-up online&lt;/a&gt; and fill in an initial, 10 minute survey. Then, once a week, they will automatically get sent a follow-up questionnaire asking about their experiences of COVID-19, how they’ve been spending their time, and their physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By tracking a large number of participants over time, the team hopes to figure out what people can do at home to protect their mental health. They will release the findings regularly to the public and to the government and health authorities, beginning from next week. And they’re in it for the long haul, says Fancourt. “As long as this pandemic is going on, and we’re having these isolation measures, we want to make sure that there is a way that we’re tracking the experiences of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fancourt emphasises that it is crucial that people stay home — doing so will save lives. And there are activities known to be good for our mental health that we can already be doing, she adds: practising music and arts, for instance, or volunteering and providing support for others in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy Orben from the University of Cambridge is part of another team planning a large, year-long study tracking the responses of adolescents and adults during the pandemic. The researchers, who are currently in discussion with funders, plan on tracking participants’ mood and mental health through the use of an app, which will send questions to their phones on a regular basis. Importantly, this app will also record behavioural data: what other apps people are using, for instance, and how long they are spending on their phones, as well as their movement and sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in Fancourt’s study, the researchers hope the work will untangle how people’s activities relate to their mental health. They also plan on looking at how any events and announcements related to the pandemic affect participants’ responses. Orben says the team is keen to rapidly share data with the research community so that it can be analysed as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Orben, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/28/episode-19-should-we-worry-about-screen-time/&quot;&gt;whose research focuses on the psychological effects of media use&lt;/a&gt;, one of the key questions will be how technology is being utilised in a time where face-to-face interaction is extremely limited. “I think it will allow us to move away from just thinking about time spent online and on screens to having more nuanced conversations about … what activities on screens are people actually engaging in,” she says. “Which ones of those are beneficial and help mitigate the effects of social isolation, and which ones might actually exacerbate stress?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring messaging and behaviour &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some researchers have already conducted preliminary research and published the results — as preprints, at least. Many of these studies have attempted to examine the value of different forms of public health messaging, or determine how people are behaving during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/9yqs8&quot;&gt;recent preprint&lt;/a&gt; which surveyed more than 1,000 Americans across two days in March. The team, led by Jim Everett at the University of Kent and Molly Crocket at Yale University, looked at how moral messages could promote public health behaviours. Participants read a Facebook post urging people to stay at home, which was either accompanied by a “deontological” argument, telling people it was their duty to protect their community; a “utilitarian” argument, asking people to think of the negative consequences of not making these sacrifices now; an appeal to virtue, reminding people that staying home is what a good person would do; or no moral argument. They then indicated how likely they would be to adopt public health-related behaviours like washing their hands after getting home, or avoiding public gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were more likely to indicate they would share the deontological message — the one that appealed to their sense of duty — than a post with no moral argument or a virtue-based one.  And there was some evidence that the deontological argument might increase people’s intentions to engage in health-related behaviours: participants reported a stronger intention to wash their hands after reading this message compared to the virtue-based one, for instance, although this effect did not reach statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that messages focused on citizens’ duties and responsibilities to others may be particularly useful. But the work is preliminary and there are important caveats: it only looks at people’s &lt;em&gt;intentions&lt;/em&gt; rather than actual behaviour, and the effects are small and are not always significant. “What we’re very much &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; suggesting is that framing these judgments in more ‘deontological’ ways is unequivocally going to have huge impacts on behaviour,” acknowledges Everett. But still, the findings are consistent with past work, he says, adding that even interventions that produce small changes could, together, have an impact in the pandemic. The team is now working with other groups to see whether similar effects are found outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have also looked at how differences in personalities influence how likely we are to accept constraints to our quality of life (like social isolation) in order to protect ourselves or others from the virus. Ingo Zettler and colleagues from the University of Copenhagen &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/pkm2a/&quot;&gt;have posted a preprint&lt;/a&gt; based on a survey of 799 Danish citizens who completed personality questionnaires. Participants who scored higher on the so-called “Dark Factor” — which relates to people’s willingness to pursue their own interests at the expense of others — were less likely to accept these constraints. In contrast, those who scored higher on the trait of emotionality, who tend to be more anxious and empathetic, were more likely to follow them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other rapid studies have included research into &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/dz428&quot;&gt;Americans’ perceptions of risk and behaviours&lt;/a&gt; early on in the pandemic, how &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/y2cg5/&quot;&gt;empathy relates to social distancing&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/epcyb/&quot;&gt;“optimism bias”&lt;/a&gt; when people consider the chance they will contract or pass on the virus. Again, it’s important to point out that most of this research consists of preprints which have not yet been peer-reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proceeding quickly… &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These studies represent just a snapshot of the work psychologists are conducting in the midst of the current crisis. J Nathan Matias from Cornell University and Alex Leavitt from Facebook Research have set up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/natematias/covid-19-social-science-research&quot;&gt;COVID-19 Social Science Research Tracker&lt;/a&gt;, in which researchers can record details of projects they are working on. As of 26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; March, more than 100 projects are listed, on everything from the spread of conspiracy theories to the effects of remote teaching on education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the list is to help researchers who are planning studies find ways of working together and determine where they should be channelling their efforts, says Matias. The tracker will also ensure people are aware of new results as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other networks are also getting involved in the response. The Psychological Science Accelerator, a network of labs which collaborate on large-scale studies, recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://psysciacc.org/2020/03/21/join-the-psas-rapid-response-covid-19-project/&quot;&gt;put out a call for “rapid and impactful studies”&lt;/a&gt; to understand the psychological side of the pandemic. The group has decided to go ahead with three of the proposals, including a study that will examine the behavioural benefits of framing public health information in terms of gains (e.g. lives saved) rather than losses (e.g. deaths). Several journals have also joined &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurochambers.blogspot.com/2020/03/calling-all-scientists-rapid-evaluation.html&quot;&gt;an initiative calling for submissions of Registered Reports&lt;/a&gt; on research related to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;strong&gt; but with caution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While researchers conduct rapid research and stick preprints online, there’s another key effort that scientists can get involved in, says Matias: peer-review. “As we move quickly to organise the production of new knowledge, we absolutely need people who can take the time to look through those preprints … and get us to the point of verified knowledge in time for it to be useful,” he says. Orben echoes these concerns: “Just because things are urgent doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be scrutinised.” That scrutiny itself will need to become more instantaneous, she adds. Many journals, including the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lauragesmith/status/1240712219731558402/photo/1&quot;&gt;British Journal of Social Psychology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BPSOfficial/status/1242892821629153280?s=20&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;British Journal of Health Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are already promising expedited peer review of papers related to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some psychologists have stressed that it’s also important this rapid response is informed by past work, whether that consists of studies into outbreaks specifically, or just well-grounded psychological science more generally. “The first rule of preventing harm is learning from what’s been done before,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vaughanbell/status/1241991708436504577?s=20&quot;&gt;tweeted Vaughan Bell recently&lt;/a&gt;. “If it’s urgent, the urgency is to do it right”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although many researchers are able to conduct psychological research in the midst of a pandemic, Matias emphasises that not everyone is in a position to do so.  “A lot of people have been impacted themselves in ways that make it difficult to continue research. And that’s okay,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who do have the time or means to do so, however, it can be rewarding. “It’s easy to feel quite helpless at the moment,” says Everett. “I’m really glad I’m doing it – it makes me feel like I am perhaps able to contribute in some small part”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psychologist&lt;em&gt; also has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-33/april-2020/coronavirus-psychological-perspectives&quot;&gt;growing collection of resources&lt;/a&gt; relating to COVID-19&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 2.6 million babies a year are stillborn. Although it’s always devastating to lose a baby,  parents grieving for a stillborn child are more likely to experience depression and post-traumatic stress than those when the child had been born alive.  There is considerable stigma, social shame and marginalization associated with parental grief for a stillborn child with the result that it has attracted little attention by health care providers, resulting in inadequate support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents grieving for a stillborn child are more likely to experience depression and post-traumatic stress than those when the child had been born alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farrales et al. recently ran a qualitative participatory research study to explore the experiences of bereaved parents when interacting with health care providers during and after the stillbirth of their child.Results showed was that both mothers and fathers needed acknowledgement from their health care provider that the baby was a irreplaceable individual in its own right, recognized that they were parents that were grieving, recognized how traumatic stillbirth is and recognition that the parents will continue to feel bereaved for a time and that they needed support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cocites.com/&quot;&gt;CoCites&lt;/a&gt; was developed by Janssens et al. at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html&quot;&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike many other tools for searching though the scientific literature, CoCites uses citations rather than keywords. It has been designed to be more efficient than the traditional keyword-based methods and works on the assumption that the user knows at least one highly relevant article within their chosen research area, pulling out all articles that have previously been cited together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11776 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/student-849822_1920-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article describes the results of using CoCites to reproduce the literature searches of a number of published systematic reviews and meta-analyses; these showed that CoCites retrieved a median of 75% of the articles that were included in the original reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who play sports are often faced  with a dilemma when they are injured. Should they continue playing or stop. Until now, the implications of playing sport when injured on both joint health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has not been investigated. With this in mind, Bullock et al. performed research on the relationship between playing while injured, HRQoL, osteoarthritis and persistent joint pain, comparing findings across both elite and recreational cricket players. The study involved asking participates to fill in a questionnaire describing their history &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-11777&quot; height=&quot;255&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/cricket-724617_1920-300x255.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;of playing sport while injured and details on any diagnosed osteoarthritis and/or persistent joint pain. It was found that, indeed, cricketers who played injured had their HRQoL adversely affected and were at increased risk of osteoarthritis and joint pain. The authors conclude that the long-term impact of playing while injured should be considered when advising athletes on their ability to compete following an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-020-1946-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;How many words are Australian children hearing in their first year of life?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is evidence to suggest that parents from more socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds interact verbally with their children less than parents from more advantaged background, resulting in what has been coined “the 30 million-word gap”. Brushe et al. decided to explore this further, investigating the number of worlds children hear in their first year of life and whether this is influenced by the level of education attained by the mother. The five year study involved grouping the mothers into high or low education groups and then collecting data from audio-recordings when the children were 6 months old and again when they were a year old.  The number of words spoken by the mothers when they were talking to their children were counted using the Language Environment Analysis software. Results showed that there was a large variation of words spoken by the mother within each education group, but no meaningful differences between the different educational groups. This suggests that a word gap associated with the level of education attained by the mother is not apparent in the first year of a child’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll probably be familiar with the idea of behavioural “nudges” — interventions that encourage people to make better choices, without changing the actual options available. As a concept, nudging has become hugely popular, with at least 200 “nudge units” in governments and institutions around the world. We’ve certainly reported on a few studies finding that simple nudges &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/03/giving-people-simple-moral-nudges-encourages-them-to-donate-much-more-to-charity/&quot;&gt;encourage people to give more to charity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/19/simply-changing-the-order-of-fast-food-menus-nudges-customers-towards-healthier-soft-drink-choices/&quot;&gt;help people to make healthier soft drink choices from fast food menus&lt;/a&gt;, for example. You might be forgiven for thinking, then, that there are no limits to what nudging can do….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0795-z&quot;&gt;set of studies&lt;/a&gt; designed to “nudge” commuters’ behaviour, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour &lt;/em&gt;and involving a total of almost 69,000 people, has found that there definitely are limits. “The failure of these well-powered experiments … highlights both the difficulty of changing commuter behaviour and the importance of publishing null results to build cumulative knowledge about how to encourage sustainable travel,” write Ariella S. Kristal and Ashley V. Whillans, of Harvard Business School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39383&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants were employees of a major European airport. About half had reported driving by themselves to and from work. But almost 60% of this group said they would consider carpooling, and 41% said that finding a “matched” person with a similar commute to carpool with was a key reason why they weren’t already doing it. Many employees also reported that if they were given discounts on public transport, they’d be more likely to use it. The airport did already have a carpool service, and was also well connected to subway, rail and bus infrastructure. It seemed, then, like the ideal place to nudge people towards commuter behaviours that would benefit their own health and pocket, as well as, of course, the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first experiment, Kristal and Whillans tested a letter and email campaign designed to encourage employees to sign up for carpooling by highlighting the benefits and providing testimonials from carpoolers. Though this intervention did increase registrants, this increase was tiny, and, statistically, it made absolutely no difference to the numbers who actually used the service. (For this study, the researchers sent out 15,000 letters. Only 33 employees registered for the service as a result. One month later, only three who’d received the initial letter were active carpoolers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second study, they gave employees details of good personal carpooling matches, and reminded them that carpooling would save them money. (Remember, a lack of knowledge about someone suitable to carpool with was reported in initial surveys as a key barrier to doing it.) But  again, this intervention did not increase carpooling behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, they tried giving a different group of more than 7,000 employees a free one-week bus trial. But this intervention failed to subsequently increase registration for discounted bus passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fourth experiment, the pair provided just over 1,000 employees with comprehensive personalised travel plans. These plans included information about carpooling matches, bus and train routes and times, transit pass discounts and bike routes. These employees were also offered a one-on-one session with the airport commuter team to talk this through. Only 21 people signed up for these sessions. And, overall, the intervention made no difference whatsoever to the participants’ commuter behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one significant limitation to the study that the researchers themselves point out: this particular airport offers employees a free parking space. Perhaps these attempted nudges would have had more impact on people who have to pay for their parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they do draw a few cautionary conclusions from their findings. One: the work “suggests that people do not always reveal their true intentions or barriers to sustainable commuting.” Though many had initially said that they &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; carpool or use public transport if they had discounted travel, this isn’t what transpired. Further work will be needed to investigate exactly why this is (maybe they don’t really want to talk to co-workers during the commute, for example). But it does seem that nudges aren’t enough to change commuter behaviours. Heavier-handed policies, such as congestion charges and parking bans, may be necessary to bring about shifts in this type of behaviour, the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, though, they think the findings also suggest that nudges might not be that effective at changing habitual behaviours, in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An accompanying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0832-y&quot;&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; in the journal welcomes the publication of this paper. Though the majority of studies reporting nudge interventions have found them to be successful, given the known problem of bias towards publishing positive results, “it’s possible that many more unsuccessful interventions exist but have never been reported,” the editorial observes. And clearly, this is an example of a case where null results have policy implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the editorial notes, “the study points to the limits of nudges and reminds us that they are not a panacea. While they can be a low-cost and simple way to shift many behaviours, it’s important to remember that not all behaviours are equally easy to shift.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0795-z&quot;&gt;What we can learn from five naturalistic field experiments that failed to shift commuter behaviour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our relationship with our parents can have a big impact on our life trajectory. Research has found that those of us &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/04/lying-to-your-kids-could-make-them-more-dishonest-and-less-well-adjusted-as-adults/&quot;&gt;lied to by&lt;/a&gt; caregivers often end up less well-adjusted, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/11/is-your-work-ethic-rooted-in-the-quality-of-the-relationship-you-had-with-your-parents/&quot;&gt;hard workers&lt;/a&gt; are more likely to produce children with good work ethics, that cognitive skills can be improved by having &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/06/04/largest-observational-study-of-its-kind-finds-talkative-parents-have-kids-with-better-cognitive-skills-but-its-not-clear-why/&quot;&gt;talkative parents&lt;/a&gt;, and that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/12/15/positive-parenting-gets-under-the-skin-showing-up-years-later-in-the-cortisol-response/&quot;&gt;positive parenting&lt;/a&gt; can impact cortisol levels even years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But though we might pay less attention to it, how parents relate to one another is also important for children’s long-term development. A new study, published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13524-019-00851-w&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demography&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;has taken a look at affection within parental relationships, finding that loving spousal relationships can have a positive long-term impact on children’s life paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39379&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The researchers focused on Nepal, which they say provides an interesting backdrop for an investigation into marriage. Marriage has changed significantly in the country over the last few years: marrying for love (as opposed to arranged marriage) is now more common than it used to be, and rates of divorce and premarital cohabitation are also increasing in the country, though remain rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data was gathered from a longitudinal study, where marital relationship quality and the educational and personal progress of children were tracked for twelve years. The first set of data was collected from 151 neighborhoods in the Western Chitwan Valley in 1996. The quality of relationships among married participants was measured by asking partners separately how much they loved their husband or wife on a three-point scale, and participants were also asked whether their spouse had ever beaten them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To look at how parents’ relationships influenced children’s own marriage behaviour, the researchers then tracked the age at which children married over the next 10 years. In 2008, they also re-interviewed participants, asking mothers whether or not their children had dropped out of school, and if so at what age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggested that marriage quality was in fact associated with children’s educational prospects. Children with parents who reported greater love for each other were less likely to drop out of school, whilst those whose parents reported less love were more likely to stop education. Children with parents who reported spousal violence were also more likely to drop out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educational outcomes were also related to both class and ethnicity: children from ethnic groups with higher social status, from wealthier households, or whose parents had higher educational backgrounds were more likely to remain in education. The relationship between marriage quality and children’s life outcomes was still significant after controlling for these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children’s own marriage timing was also linked to levels of their parents’ spousal love: the more positive the parental relationship, the later children got married. It’s important to note that in the context of the study, this was considered to be a good thing — in Nepal, later marriage can imply a better match, and that children feel less need to leave the family home at any cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as expected, the quality of parents’ marriages had a significant impact on their children, both in terms of educational attainment and on their own relationships later in life. However, the findings may not bear out in the rest of the world, where other cultural factors may come into play. There may also have been nuances that were missed in the measures. For instance, participants were asked only about instances of &lt;em&gt;extreme&lt;/em&gt; conflict between spouses; conflicts or abuse may have occurred that were more subtle or less extreme than domestic violence, but that had an impact on children nonetheless. Similarly, educational attainment was measured only by when children dropped out of school, failing to take into consideration what students did after leaving school or the grades they achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limitations aside, the results do pose an interesting question about how spousal relationships impact children. It’s understandable that parents spend much of their time focusing on their interactions with their children — but looking at the way they feel about their partner may be just as useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13524-019-00851-w&quot;&gt;Parents’ Marital Quality and Children’s Transition to Adulthood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a musician is playing a piece, and the audience is enjoying it, they can develop physical synchronies. Both might tap their feet, sway their bodies, or clap their hands. “Through music, the producer and the perceiver connect emotionally and behaviourally,” note the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920301427?dgcid=rss_sd_all&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt;. And now this team, led by Yingying Hou at East China Normal University, has uncovered a connection right down at the neural level. The team has observed “inter-brain coherence” (IBC) — a synchronisation in brain activity — between a musician and the audience. What’s more, the strength of this coherence could be used to predict how much the audience enjoyed a piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39376&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The team used a technique called near-infrared spectroscopy to monitor the brain activity of a professional violinist while he was videoed playing a series of 12 brief, classical pieces. They then used the same technique (which involves shining beams of light through the skull, to monitor changes in blood flow) on 16 women while they watched the video, and listened to all of these pieces. (Because gender differences in inter-brain synchronisation have previously been observed, only women were recruited as listeners.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The violinist had been instructed to look directly at the camera and maintain a neutral expression while he played the pieces, which each lasted about 100 seconds. If he was enjoying one piece more than another, the team hoped this would not be obvious to the viewers. They were told to gaze at the violinist’s face while they listened. After each piece, they rated how much they liked it on a seven-point scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data revealed inter-brain coherence between each of the listeners and the musician, for all of the violin pieces. That is, there were similar patterns of heightened activity in certain key regions of the brain while the violinist played and the other participants listened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key regions included the left temporal cortex (which is thought to focus on processing the rhythm of sound information), the right inferior frontal cortex and the postcentral cortices. These two latter regions have been highlighted as important hubs of a hypothesised mirror system that allows a sender and receiver to share brain representations. “In the present study, the frontoparietal mirror neuron system allows audiences to experience or comprehend the mind of the performer as if they were to ‘walk in another’s shoes’,” the researchers believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also produced an average IBC score for each piece of music, and compared these with the listeners’ averaged liking scores for each piece. They found clear correlations. The more popular pieces were marked by stronger inter-brain coherence in the left temporal cortex between the audience as a whole and the performer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also reported that the link between level of coherence and popularity only developed during the second half of each piece. This could be because there are two stages to music appreciation, they suggest. The first stage involves recognising rhythms, and identifying the potential musical structure of a piece. During the next stage, the listener develops aesthetic judgements and experiences emotional resonance, and generates stronger predictions about the sounds that ‘should’ follow. “If the expectation matches the incoming information, the musical performance will be experienced as pleasant,” the team thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More work will be needed to explain why the coherence-liking effect only emerged at a group level, and to explore whether the results obtained here will also apply to other types of musical instrument, and other genres. The team also note that the near-infrared technique only allowed them to look at blood flow in the cortex, not other deeper areas that might be involved in the response to music production and perception, too, such as limbic structures. Also, by design, this study only involved women. Whether men will respond in the same way is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s fascinating research. “This study expands our understanding of music appreciation,” the researchers write, adding: “The results can potentially be applied to the development of brain indices for predicting public attitudes towards various musical performances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920301427?dgcid=rss_sd_all&quot;&gt;The averaged inter-brain coherence between the audience and a violinist predicts the popularity of violin performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020&quot;&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; was announced on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization, marking a turning point for the public health systems serving the health of constituent populations across the globe. This declaration moment is important for narrative on COVID-19 because it is the point at which it is accepted that the virus is not only travelling to different countries, but is now circulating in those countries. Governments are now required to take action to moderate the impact of the infection, reducing harm for the polity until the virus – through the mutation of its biological properties, human immunity, vaccines or some combination of these – takes its place, we hope, among the many other microbes with which human life has found co-existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO declaration is also an important moment for the COVID-19 story because it reveals how data about notifications of diagnosed infection and deaths are used to make decisions and therefore reveals how, in the circumstances of a pandemic, it is keenly apparent that numerical and narrative futures constitute each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandemics are narrated into meaningful existence and COVID-19 is no exception. In Australia, for instance, news stories on the novel coronavirus have escalated since January 2020 to become headlined on many broadcast and digital news platforms. This pattern of media interest conforms to what has been seen in previous outbreaks. Swine flu in 2009 was a significant media event that did not go unremarked in the interviews and focus groups I and colleagues conducted with members of the general population variously impacted by the pandemic threat. Ebola, too, was a prominent news story in 2014 as was Zika in the run up to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro  in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 resembles these other outbreaks and pandemics, but the news stories about it seem to have a distinctively numerical quality. The number of known infections in a particular place over a period of time gives an index of the transmissibility of an infection. Mortality rates – a measure of the proportion of people that die with an infection – are also woven into pandemic stories, in general. But COVID-19’s numbers seem to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; its story. News feeds continually update the counts of diagnoses and deaths, and have numerically tracked the contagion from a supposed source in China to other countries, notably South Korea, Iran and Italy, and then to most other parts of the world. This pandemic by numbers approach charts the particular transmissibility and severity of this virus, but also lends itself to our increasingly complex small-screen media diet, where numbers and graphs alongside images and videos more easily convey the COVID-19 story than do long form narrative texts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 also comes into a context where public health systems have increasingly turned to mathematical models to make decisions about how to manage various infections, notably HIV and influenza. Models are used to decide how to apply resources and strategies to best effect. For example, modelling has shown how HIV can be prevented by HIV treatments, because they reduce the likelihood of the transmission of the virus. For influenza, models are used to calculate what proportion of the population needs to be vaccinated to protect the whole population from an emerging infection. These models can be adjusted to fit what is known about the biosocial properties of a particular infection, the efficacy of treatments and vaccines, and cost. In the case of COVID-19, for example, models may be indicating that containment will reduce the speed and scope of transmission and therefore reduce mortality, the burden on the health system, and ultimately the cost for governments. COVID-19 may be a fully-fledged algorithmic pandemic in the sense that its storyline is transparently about its numbers and because it is managed in terms of the models that combine numerical indices of transmission, mortality, burden, and cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathematical models and narratives also have a point of contact in relation to futures and pasts: they both offer means of trying to shape what might happen through action in the present guided by understandings of what has happened. Decision-makers want to know how to act now to reduce the future impact of a pandemic and models support these decisions by analysing pre-existing data about transmission, mortality, the benefits and costs of treatments, vaccines and containment, for example. Modelling, then, looks to what the future might be by assessing a pandemic’s past numbers. This is strictly true even during the course of a particular pandemic. Narratives on pandemic futures also recall the past, for example, through reference to the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, swine flu in 2009, and other outbreaks, and on that basis orient the narrator and their interlocutors to possible futures. Public policy statements about containment requirements and news media vision of empty supermarket shelves both reflect action in the present that is predicated on pasts and aims to shape futures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all its life threatening, anxiety-making potential, though, the numerical narrative on COVID-19 is surprisingly impersonal. Stories of the many lives affected by the pandemic and the full tenor of its corporeal horrors are crowded out by governmental advice and updating of the numbers. One reason for this separation of pandemic knowing and lived experience is their incommensurability. Pandemics are constituted in the sheer scale and spread of their numbers, so much so that no one person can experience a pandemic without recourse to some signification of this calculated, collective plight. Infections, in contrast, are visceral and personal, including for those who devote themselves to providing care. Moreover, narrative arguably meets its limits in the experience of an infection because, like traumatic experience, living through a debilitating one is not an easy story to tell. Some accounts of how people experienced the 1918-1919 pandemic remark on the lack of affect, giving the impression that emotion was bracketed aside as irresponsible, impossible or even a luxury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerical narrative, then, may not only be one of the ways we can know a pandemic is happening; it may provide the means of living with emerging threat. As they say, time – and numbers – will tell how things turn out for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: “people walking on train station” by Liliya Lisa.

 &lt;p&gt;Diets and superfoods are all the rage. From acai berries to the Zone diet, many a dietary trend has come along promising a range of benefits, such as weight loss, heart health, and improved cognition. But the science behind these claims is often sketchy at best. One dietary regime that has stood the test of time – and importantly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/5-studies-on-the-mediterranean-diet&quot;&gt;scientific scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; – is the Mediterranean diet. Earlier this year, U.S. News and World Report named the Mediterranean diet as &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://health.usnews.com/wellness/food/articles/how-us-news-ranks-best-diets&quot;&gt;the best diet of 2020&lt;/a&gt; for the third year in a row. The diets were scored by a panel of nationally recognized experts in diet and nutrition. In second place was another consistent high performer in the rankings, the DASH diet (DASH stands for dietary approaches to stop hypertension) which focuses on lowering blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are on a DASH diet or the Mediterranean diet you are probably eating fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods, as well as whole-grain foods, fish, poultry, and nuts.  You are also probably consuming olive oil as a substitute for unhealthy vegetable or coconut oils.  Olive Oil, particularly the extra virgin preparation, contains lots of antioxidants (just look at that rich color; it screams anti-oxidants) and also has significant anti-Inflammatory properties. Everyone knows that these are the two most important properties of healthy foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body clearly benefits from eating olive oil. Does your brain care?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answering this question is not easy. First of all, olive oil is a complex blend of various chemicals. It would be nice to know which of these is most advantageous and whether they influence brain health directly or indirectly. A recent study attempted to find answers using an animal model that mimics conditions of multiple sclerosis in the human brain. Multiple sclerosis is characterized by brain inﬂammation leading to numerous degenerative changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain inflammation present in multiple sclerosis patients is thought to be driven by changes in the gut microbiome. Scientists now understand that the gut microbiome plays a signiﬁcant role in both the progression and severity of the disease. This is the likely scenario: an imbalance in the gut bacteria leads to inflammation, chemical debris released from the bacteria migrate out of the gut into the blood and then into the brain. The most harmful of these bacterial debris is called lipopolysaccharide and it can induce a powerful inflammatory response inside the brain. People with multiple sclerosis have elevated levels of lipopolysaccharide in their brains, spinal cords, and blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olive oil modifies how your gut microbiome communicates with your brain. Olive oil’s beneficial effects on the human brain and body are likely related to the presence of the polyphenols hydroxytyrosol and oleic acid. Hydroxytyrosol protects cells that are under oxidative stress. Oleic acid has beneficial effects on blood cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1080/1028415X.2018.1469281&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of olive oil demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Administering olive oil animals significantly reduced the number of harmful chemicals that can cause tissue injury and aging, particularly within the brain. Olive oil administration also increased levels of the enzymes that provide protection against oxidative damage in the brain and also reduces the negative actions the lipopolysaccharide released by bacteria in the gut. Olive oil also reduced the level of inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, yes, your brain benefits a lot from adding olive oil to your diet and these benefits originate in response to the changes that olive oil makes to your gut microbiome. Olive oil should become a big part of the diet for anyone with an aging brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: Photo by Steve Buissinne from &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/olive-oil-salad-dressing-cooking-968657/&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-olive-oil-promotes-brain-health/&quot;&gt;How olive oil promotes brain health&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620131832/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620131832/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-importance-of-character-during-war/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The importance of character during war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/why-we-like-a-good-robot-story-2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why we like a good robot story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/protecting-workers-from-covid-19/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Protecting workers from COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 2020 World Happiness Report has been published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, with Finland ranking as the world’s happiest country. “&lt;/strong&gt;Happiness” in the report doesn’t refer to the expression of emotion &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/world/europe/world-happiness-report.html&quot;&gt;writes Maria Cramer&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, but is rather about a sense of satisfaction in life and belief that members of one’s community care for each other — a particularly poignant definition given present circumstances.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39371&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An imaging technique adapted from geophysics could provide a new way of looking at the human brain, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://physicsworld.com/a/seismic-imaging-technology-sees-deep-inside-the-brain/&quot;&gt;reports Ian Randall&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Physics World&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers have traditionally been unable to scan the brain using ultrasound, as the waves are scattered by the skull. But now a team have shown that ultrasound &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be used to record signals from inside the skull, with the help of a method normally used to construct images from below the surface of the Earth based on seismometer recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have developed an AI capable of smelling certain odours&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2237534-ai-can-pick-out-specific-odours-from-a-combination-of-smells/&quot;&gt;reports Gege Li&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist.&lt;/em&gt; Chemical sensors respond to particular odours in the environment, and an algorithm then uses that pattern of response to identify the smell, similar to the processes used by the mammalian olfactory bulb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a myth that autistic people aren’t social&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/autistic-people-make-great-social-partners-if-you-actually-give-them-a-chance/&quot;&gt;writes Scott Barry Kaufmann&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;. Negative impressions about the social life of autistic people are driven by the biases of others –— including researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volunteers who thought they were taking part in a psychedelic drug study experienced mood changes and even hallucinations — but hours into the experience, they learned they had only been taking a placebo&lt;/strong&gt;. At &lt;em&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/the-amazing-psychedelic-bamboozle&quot;&gt;Neuroskeptic describes&lt;/a&gt; the lengths that researchers went to, in order to trick participants into thinking they were taking an active drug. The study highlights the importance of disentangling placebo effects from those actually caused by psychoactive substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can crosswords teach us about memory?&lt;/strong&gt; At &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/this-is-your-brain-on-crosswords/&quot;&gt;Adrienne Raphel examines&lt;/a&gt; how word puzzles provide a glimpse into the inner workings of our mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, a selection of  coronavirus-related psychology coverage from this week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, Sarita Robinson &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-self-isolation-a-psychologist-explains-how-to-avoid-cabin-fever-133317&quot;&gt;suggests some measures&lt;/a&gt; you can take to avoid cabin fever during self-isolation, while Emma Maynard &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-how-to-help-children-through-isolation-and-lockdown-133990&quot;&gt;discusses how to make the situation easier for children&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Open Access and Open Science are critical, especially in times of crisis. The COVID-19 outbreak shows how important it is for medical professionals, scientific experts, and every member of the public to have immediate access to the latest science. Equal access to the latest research can assuage public fears or spur government action. Today, we’re happy to report that &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; published its first COVID-19 paper since we started &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/&quot;&gt;fast-tracking submissions on January 31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science leaders have &lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/covid19-open-access-letter.pdf&quot;&gt;recently requested&lt;/a&gt; that the publishing community make their content open and re-usable. PLOS &lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/publishers-make-coronavirus-covid-19-content-freely-available-and-reusable&quot;&gt;already supports&lt;/a&gt;, and calls on others to support, COVID-19 research being shared such that it can be centrally text- and data-mined, and also versioned in places where it can be most conveniently discovered by those tackling this crisis in real time. We always push &lt;u&gt;all &lt;/u&gt;PLOS content to PubMed Central.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230548&quot;&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; was conducted by Mingli Yuan and colleagues from the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The researchers studied 27 patients infected with COVID-19 and admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan. In this patient group, the authors associated clinical features identified from computed tomography (CT) scans of patients’ lungs with eventual outcomes. They scored patients based on features they observed such as ground glass opacity, abnormality on both sides, and widespread distribution of pathology in the lungs, to produce an overall severity score for each patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Yuan adds: “This study allows us to compare radiologic findings with the mortality of patients infected with COVID-19.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since February 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, PLOS’ family of journals have received approximately 175 coronavirus-related submissions. This paper had a turnaround time of less than 21 days from submission to acceptance. A fast, open and transparent process of publishing reliable, peer reviewed science &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;its underlying data is an important contribution towards tackling this outbreak, and we are happy to make contributions to this effort. We are forwarding all of our submissions to the World Health Organization for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov&quot;&gt;database of publications on coronavirus disease (COVID-19)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are compiling all our Coronavirus-related papers into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://collections.plos.org/covid-19&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/a&gt; as they publish. Meanwhile, you can keep tabs on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/dfs&quot;&gt;Disease Forecasting and Surveillance Channel&lt;/a&gt; for curated research related to coronavirus. We encourage all researchers investigating pressing issues like disease outbreaks and climate change, to also consider posting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/why-preprint&quot;&gt;Preprint&lt;/a&gt;.  You can find the most recent preprints relating to the coronavirus outbreak – posted across bioRxiv and medRxiv on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/181&quot;&gt;search link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults are vulnerable to all kinds of body illusions. We can be made to feel that a&lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-27/edition-3/interview-people-have-been-ignoring-body-long-time&quot;&gt; fake hand, or even a fake body, is our own; that we’ve left our body; even that we’re the size of a doll&lt;/a&gt;. These illusions work because our brains use information from various senses to create mental representations of our bodies. Mess with some of these sensory signals, and you can alter those representations, sometimes drastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work to date suggests that young children don’t show the same susceptibilities to body illusions, presumably because the systems that underpin them are still developing. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59979-0&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;, has found that a bizarre auditory-induced illusion that affects adults doesn’t work in quite the same way in young kids, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39359&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/10/28/how-listening-to-an-ipod-shrinks-your-sense-of-personal-space/&quot;&gt;Ana Tajadura-Jiménez&lt;/a&gt;, now at Charles III University of in Madrid, has led all kinds of fascinating work showing that body illusions can be triggered through the manipulation of sound. Take her “&lt;a href=&quot;http://magicshoes.es/the-team/&quot;&gt;magic shoes&lt;/a&gt;“, for example. Microphones record the sound of the wearer walking. But this sound is then filtered, so only the the higher-pitched portions are played on to them, through earphones. This has the effect of making the wearer sound lighter, which leads them to report &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; lighter and more sprightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new study, Elena Nava at the University of Milano-Bicocca and Tajadura-Jiménez turned to what’s known as the “auditory Pinocchio illusion”. In earlier work, Tajadura-Jiménez and colleagues had found that if adults pull up on their index finger while listening to brief sounds of rising pitch, they have the feeling that their finger is getting longer. Why? Other research has found that we associate a “high” pitch with a high position in physical space, and so, Tajadura-Jiménez suspects, this metaphor is influencing our perceptions. Like adults, even babies get the “high” vs “low” pitch metaphor — so perhaps young children would experience this illusion, too. But when the pair tried a version of it on a group of 30 four- to six-year-olds, and on a group of 30 adults, they found some differences between the responses of the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this study, the participants didn’t pull on their own fingers. Rather, they pressed their palm up against a vertical wooden surface, and their hand was screened with a cloth, so they couldn’t see it. An experimenter then repeatedly either pulled or pressed on their middle finger while they heard a tone that ascended in pitch, descended in pitch or remained constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; data-shortcode=&quot;caption&quot; id=&quot;attachment_39361&quot; style=&quot;width: 202px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Navva &amp;amp;amp; Tajadura-Jimenez 2020&quot; class=&quot;  wp-image-39361 aligncenter&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;39361&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Navva &amp;amp;amp; Tajadura-Jimenez 2020&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020.png?w=491&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020.png?w=225&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;491,655&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/19/this-weird-sound-induced-illusion-makes-you-feel-that-your-finger-has-grown-longer/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020/&quot; height=&quot;269&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020.png?w=202&amp;amp;h=269&quot; width=&quot;202&quot; /&gt;Example of the experimental set-up. &lt;em&gt;Via&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59979-0&quot;&gt;Nava &amp;amp; Tajadura-Jiménez (2020)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time, the participant used a scale on the side of the board to indicate where they felt the tip of their middle finger to be in space. They were also asked about whether they &lt;em&gt;perceived&lt;/em&gt; their finger to be getting longer, shrinking, or staying the same length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that when ascending notes were played during finger-pulling, adults indicated that their middle finger tip was higher (and so the finger was longer) than it actually was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children, on the other hand, did not indicate that their finger tip was higher during these ascending notes — and yet like the adults, they reported &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; that their finger was getting longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that by around the age of four to six, a child’s thoughts and feelings about what’s happening to its body — its “body image” — is adult-like (at least, in this context). However, its unconscious body “schema” — the brain’s map of the body in space — is not yet being calibrated in the same way as an adult’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers did not find that tones of descending pitch played while the finger was being pressed made adults or children think that their finger was getting smaller. “Why can the brain ‘accept’ a longer finger but not a shorter one?” the researchers ask. “This asymmetry could reflect the fact that the brain experiences, throughout development, the enlargement of most parts of the body, while it never experiences shrinkage,” they suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a subsequent study, the pair then tried a version of the same experiment, but with the participants’ arms and hands positioned horizontally, rather than vertically. In this orientation, the longer finger effect that they had just found in adults was not repeated. As the high/low metaphor for pitch is vertical in nature, not horizontal, this “supports our hypothesis that crossmodal ‘metaphoric’ correspondences influence the binding of multisensory information,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; data-shortcode=&quot;caption&quot; id=&quot;attachment_39363&quot; style=&quot;width: 196px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Navva &amp;amp;amp; Tajadura-Jimenez 2020_2&quot; class=&quot;  wp-image-39363 aligncenter&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;39363&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Navva &amp;amp;amp; Tajadura-Jimenez 2020_2&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020_2.png?w=487&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020_2.png?w=224&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020_2.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;487,653&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/19/this-weird-sound-induced-illusion-makes-you-feel-that-your-finger-has-grown-longer/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020_2/&quot; height=&quot;263&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020_2.png?w=196&amp;amp;h=263&quot; width=&quot;196&quot; /&gt;In the second experiment participants’ hands were positioned horizontally. &lt;em&gt;Via&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59979-0&quot;&gt;Nava &amp;amp; Tajadura-Jiménez (2020)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They would now like to see further work to establish when a child’s body map becomes adult-like, and also to explore whether individual differences in the way signals from various senses are integrated might predict our susceptibilities to body illusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59979-0&quot;&gt;Auditory-induced body distortions in children and adults&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;By Joerg Heber, Editorial Director, PLOS and Editor-in-Chief, &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As the global research community, along with everyone else, adopts measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, we wanted to update you on how we are dealing with the situation at PLOS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLOS Operations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If you have a paper in process at any PLOS journal, it is being processed as normal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are conscious of the challenges that many of you face during this crisis. We will remain supportive and flexible, which may affect individual paper processing times (more below). We are also carefully monitoring the health and well-being of our staff, managing and coordinating workloads, and supporting each other with flexibility. While the situation is far from normal in both of our primary locations (USA and UK), at this point we do not anticipate issues preventing the efficient publishing of our seven journals. We are facilitating the prompt evaluation of any papers related to the coronavirus and resulting pandemic, and all other papers are also being handled as per our standard processes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reassurance for Our Research Communities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We understand that the global research community is significantly but also variably affected by this pandemic, and so we want to provide the following clarifications and reassurance:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To Authors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are flexible regarding turnaround times for revisions and other tasks during this stressful time. Please keep in touch with us if you need any extensions or if you experience any challenges around manuscript preparation; we will work with you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are fast-tracking all relevant research related to the coronavirus and resulting pandemic, and are processing all other submissions as normal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are forwarding all submissions and papers related to the outbreak to the World Health Organization for their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;database &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;of publications on coronavirus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We encourage all researchers to also consider posting a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Preprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Please remember that – across all our journals – we protect primary research studies from being considered “scooped” by closely related, parallel studies recently published in other journals. So, there is no need to rush your research, or revisions, for the sake of being selected for novelty!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To Reviewers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If you have agreed to do a review, or would like to do a review, for a PLOS journal but need extra time, please just let us know. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If you can, please review &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/181&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Preprints related to coronavirus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; directly via the preprint’s commenting options or on the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://outbreaksci.prereview.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Rapid PreReview server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;  — this can speed up the review process down the line, as constructive comments may be vetted and used in a review process at a journal (read about PLOS’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;initiative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;) or authors can respond rapidly to comments made&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In light of the now-limited resources for experimental research due to closed laboratories, we encourage you to carefully consider the need for additional experiments or analyses in revision requests, especially if the conclusions are adequately supported by the data. (Note: while we recommend this for all journals during this crisis, this is always standard practice at PLOS ONE and simply a reminder in this case.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;How companies and teams make decisions can be very challenging. Poor or ill-structured decision-making processes can make the organization less successful and create destructive conflicts in decision-making teams. But there are a few strategies companies can try that help organizations make big decisions in a better way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People operate in complex and dynamic environments, making decisions with limited information under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity. In contrast to routine decisions, strategic decisions are often made at top-management level and they have an impact on the whole organization in terms of its future direction and the scope of its activities. Such important decisions have a significant impact of the organization’s resource allocation that require trade-offs between alternatives and the setting of organizational priorities. In addition the strategic decision making process  rarely results in one clear best solution to the problem, but an organization makes a  decision it will be difficult to reverse. This is because the implementation of a decision involves a significant resource commitment and change in organizational activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we have ways to assess risk through probability theory, dealing with strategic decision problems is much more difficult where the information we gather to support a decision and the actual decision outcomes are uncertain and ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxfordre.com/psychology/psychology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-262&quot;&gt;In complex decision situations, groups are better at solving problems than acting alone&lt;/a&gt;. This may be because group members bring a variety of information, critical judgment, solution strategies, and a wide range of perspectives to the decision problem. However, groups can be subject to destructive conflict and cognitive biases that may hinder the quality of decision outcomes and group members’ decision acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main group decision-making biases are &lt;em&gt;risky shift&lt;/em&gt;, as groups tend to make risker decisions than individuals alone, and &lt;em&gt;groupthink&lt;/em&gt;, as group members strive for consensus and harmony in their decision-making. In addition, group conflict may arise when people with competing opinions and solution alternatives clash.  Group decision-making, therefore, presents a managerial conundrum. On the one hand, multiple perspectives of group members can add insight into the problem situation. On the other hand, group diversity can produce fragmentation, conflict, or groupthink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group member interaction in decision-making situations may produce two types of conflict: cognitive and affective conflict. Task-focused&lt;em&gt; cognitive conflict&lt;/em&gt; arises when group members focus on a task or an issue and debate to come up with a creative solution.  Cognitive conflict improves decision-making quality as the goal of the decision-makers is to find the best possible solution rather than win the argument. However, there is a danger that this beneficial cognitive conflict spills into a dysfunctional, affective conflict. Instead of working constructively to achieve the best possible solution, the debate becomes personal, adversarial, and a lose-win paradigm where one view prevails while others are discarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affective conflict tends to be emotional and focuses on personal incompatibilities or disputes. These disputes can result from group members’ personal judgments that they are not fully able to explain to group members. The more these personal judgments influence decisions, the more there is potential for decision-making group members to speculate and find reasons to distrust the motivation and hidden agendas of other group members. Hence, too much affective conflict may hinder overall group performance as the decision will not be accepted by some decision-making group members regardless of the quality of the decision outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management consultants have developed several decision-making techniques to encourage critical interaction between decision-making group members. &lt;em&gt;Devil’s advocacy&lt;/em&gt; is a decision-making technique where one or more people in the group works to point out all the flaws and risks with an option under consideration. &lt;em&gt;Dialectical inquiry&lt;/em&gt; is a decision-making technique where divide into two camps: those advocating for an idea and those advocating against it. Both sides highlight the advantages of their assigned decision and outline the disadvantages of the opposing idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both dialectical inquiry and devil’s advocacy lead to higher quality assumptions and decision outcomes than a consensus approach in decision-making. However, consensus-seeking groups express more satisfaction and desire to continue to work with their groups and indicate a greater level of decision acceptance than those who were asked to apply dialectical inquiry and devil’s advocacy in their groups’ decision-making process. Hence, management scholars’ attention has turned to developing techniques that maintain moderate levels of cognitive conflict to ensure high quality decision outcomes, but simultaneously preserve group cohesion to prevent emergence of affective conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Causal mapping is a visual decision-making technique that is designed to help groups improve their strategic decision-making processes and promote cognitive conflict, while at the same time preventing the emergence of affective conflict&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Visual tools are particularly useful in strategy work as decisions are often made collectively in group working situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a causal map, ideas are causally linked to one another through the use of arrows and nodes. The arrows indicate how one idea or action leads to another. In effect, the maps are word-and-arrow diagrams where the arrows mean “might cause,” “might lead to,” or “might result in.” Causal mapping facilitates a visual articulation of a large number of ideas, actions, and their consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example of a fully developed causal map is depicted in below. The map incorporates the collective understanding of a decision-problem by a decision-making group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;310&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/gggggg-180x90.jpg&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; /&gt;Image Credits: Mikko Arevuo, ‘Epistemic objects in collective decision-making: a practice perspective on the use of causal maps as situated material artifacts’, PhD Thesis, Cranfield School of Management, Cranfield CERES (2015). [accessed 16.07.2019]&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Causal maps that have been created in groups bring together the thinking of many people, including conflicting views, subtly different slants on the same issues, and different perspectives held by individual people. Such causal maps provide simplified representations of the beliefs of the greater group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group causal mapping could be perceived as a form of brainstorming, but there is a distinction between group maps and a free-flowing brainstorming of ideas. Group mapping that is used for decision-making is focused on raising issues and concerns. These are usually activities or events that can either support or challenge the decision-making aspiration of the group. In contrast to eliciting “off-the-wall” ideas in group brainstorming sessions as the means of unleashing creativity, group mapping focuses on bringing together the group members’ current wisdom and experience, as well as issues surrounding the problem. Therefore, group mapping is a process of engaging in a dialogue to uncover the causality between the problem and a number of potential solution outcomes, represented as a visual object. The mapping process provides the means for the decision-making group to structure and merge differing perspectives that should lead eventually into a shared understanding of the issue in a holistic manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.amazon.co.uk/Visual-Strategy-Mapping-Nonprofit-Organizations-ebook/dp/B00JZUPLPU/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1583250943&amp;amp;refinements=p_27%3AJohn+M.+Bryson&amp;amp;s=digital-text&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;text=John+M.+Bryson&quot;&gt;There is increasing evidence that&lt;/a&gt; the causal mapping process prevents decision-making groups from talking over each other and going around in circles. It helps group members to speak and be heard. The mapping process produces a lot of ideas and can ultimately clarify the most suitable course of action. Furthermore, the shared and collective enactment of a group causal map can increase individual ownership, acceptance, and the feeling of fairness of the decision outcomes. This is because the map shows evidence that people have listened to everyone in the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: AbsolutVision, ‘Photo of bulb artwork’ via &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/82TpEld0_e4&quot;&gt;Unsplash &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-strategists-are-improving-team-decision-making-processes/&quot;&gt;How strategists are improving team decision-making processes&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620039770/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620039770/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fgggggg-180x90.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-importance-of-character-during-war/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The importance of character during war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/why-covid-19-could-change-how-we-work/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why COVID-19 could change how we work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/why-we-like-a-good-robot-story-2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why we like a good robot story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/adult-aging-alone-american-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrated care is characterized by a proactive and person-centered approach to care, which is seamlessly coordinated across multiple professional disciplines and care interfaces. Integrated care aims to improve outcomes such as functioning, quality of life, and quality of care. The organisation of integrated primary and community care is considered an essential step towards supporting older people to age in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintaining people’s safety at home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support older people living at home, it is essential to maintain their safety. Older people encounter limitations in multiple domains of life, which could pose risks to their ability to live safely and independently at home. Such risks may relate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/47/6/830/626240&quot;&gt;different factors&lt;/a&gt;, including people’s functioning and behavior, their physical and social environments, and the health and social care they receive. This wide range of risks could lead to a multitude of problems that challenge people’s safety at home, ultimately resulting in emergency department visits, (re)hospitalization, institutionalization and mortality. Given its proactive, interdisciplinary and comprehensive character, integrated care is expected to provide opportunities to address &lt;a href=&quot;https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/18/6/424.long&quot;&gt;the prevention of such risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-1482-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Our recently published scoping review&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Geriatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that integrated care programs for older people living at home address a broad range of safety risks. After examining included programs according to the predefined conceptual framework shown in Figure 1, findings show that all programs addressed risks related to people’s functioning and behavior, and several programs addressed risks associated with people’s health and social care management. Fewer programs addressed risks related to people’s social and physical environments. However, as the number of people receiving care and support at home keeps rising, risks related to people’s socio-economic conditions, their home environments, and increasing caregiver responsibilities, for example, are becoming more prominent. Therefore, addressing such risks is important, especially since &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-017-0521-5&quot;&gt;older people themselves also express their concerns&lt;/a&gt; regarding these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11783&quot; style=&quot;width: 299px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11783 size-full&quot; height=&quot;289&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/pic.jpg&quot; width=&quot;289&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 1. Domains of risks that could challenge people’s ability to live safely at home.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timely identification of risks, combined with relevant clinical, behavioral and environmental interventions and support, as well as care coordination or case management, would enhance care providers’ ability to support older people’s safety at home. Prioritizing such a proactive and multidimensional approach requires combining the expertise of professionals from different disciplines of health and social care. However, our scoping review suggests that these linkages between health and social care are not yet common practice in integrated care programs for older people living at home. Investing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016885101930260X&quot;&gt;collaborative skills&lt;/a&gt; and inter-professional dynamics, as well as addressing financial and organisational incentives for collaboration, are deemed necessary to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6484371/&quot;&gt;strengthen these linkages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balancing safety, autonomy, quality of care and quality of life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review showed that integrated care programs can potentially incorporate many ways of addressing and preventing risks. However, it remains challenging to priorities these activities in a way that is meaningful for older people. Adopting a person-centered way of working, in which professional expertise is tailored to people’s individual needs and preferences, is considered one of the core components of integrated care. In this light, it is important to acknowledge that safety is not the only aspect to consider, especially in the care provided in the context of people’s homes. People’s homes are not only care settings, but the setting of their daily lives, and older people may have preferences or make choices that value quality of life over safety. This means that safety risks cannot be addressed independently of older people’s perspectives. Instead, professionals are tasked to consider their professional perceptions in combination with older people’s preferences, and find a balance between aspects such as safety, prevention, autonomy and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truly supporting people to age in place requires a societal shift towards a broader paradigm of health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in practice, this raises the question of responsibility and accountability for the safety of older people living at home. Naturally, professionals have no control over how older people live their lives and the choices they make. As such, professionals cannot be held accountable for the adverse consequences of those choices. What then, exactly, is the responsibility of health and social care professionals? And what is the responsibility of older people themselves, their families, or society? How is accountability for adverse events shared across these different stakeholders? These questions necessitate a widespread debate on our perceptions and expectations of quality of care, prevention, and ethics, as well as individual, professional and societal responsibility and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding the health care paradigm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concluding, integrated care provides both a platform and tools that could be harnessed further to support older people living at home in a manner that balances safety with other values important to older people. However, it is important to note that efforts to integrate health and social care alone are not enough. Truly supporting people to age in place requires a societal shift towards a broader paradigm of health and well-being – a paradigm that recognizes the role that health, social, and environmental factors play in older people’s ability to live safely at home, and in which many different actors in the wider community play their part and perform their responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though some &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/01/23/do-smells-really-trigger-particularly-evocative-memories/&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has challenged the common conception that scent is the most evocative of all the senses, it can be undeniably powerful when you catch a whiff of something that jogs a memory. We also &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/30/people-with-a-keener-sense-of-smell-find-sex-more-pleasant-and-if-they-are-female-have-more-orgasms-during-sex/&quot;&gt;know&lt;/a&gt; that scent plays a part in sexual attraction: people with a keener sense of smell often find sex more pleasant and may even have more orgasms during sex, and the scent of a partner can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29293018&quot;&gt;reduce stress&lt;/a&gt; and increase feelings of safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So new research findings from a team at the University of British Columbia may not come as a complete surprise. In a paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620905615?rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;amp;journalCode=pssa&quot;&gt;published in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620905615?rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;amp;journalCode=pssa&quot;&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Marlise Hofer and Frances Chen suggest that the scent of your lover may not just be comforting but can also help you drift off to sleep.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39349&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team asked 155 heterosexual participants in long-term romantic relationships to sleep with a t-shirt for a pillowcase on two separate nights. One of these shirts had previously been worn for 24 hours by their romantic partner, and the other was a control shirt, which had either not been worn, or worn by a “scent donor” unknown to participants. T-shirt wearers were asked to refrain from using any scented body products and to avoid activities likely to produce odours such as exercise, smoking, sex or eating pungent foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each night, participants’ “sleep efficiency” — i.e. the proportion of time they spent in bed that they were actually asleep — was measured via a smartwatch  Then, in the morning, participants were asked what time they went to bed and got up, how they would rate their sleep quality, how well rested they felt, and whether or not they believed the scent was their partner’s or the control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, sleep efficiency was higher on nights spent sleeping with a partner’s shirt rather than with a control shirt — and this was still the case when controlling for multiple factors, including participants’ relationship quality and length, attachment style and levels of stress. Efficiency was increased by an average of 2.1% — around the same increase induced by melatonin supplements, often used to improve sleep. And though participants were able to identify their partner’s scent 70% of the time, the results also suggested that sleep efficiency improved whether or not participants were aware that the t-shirt was their partner’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to sleep quality, however, participants only reported having higher quality sleep when they &lt;em&gt;believed&lt;/em&gt; they were spending the night with their partner’s shirt, whether or not they were actually exposed to their smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual differences, the team notes, are likely to moderate these effects, something the study did not explore in depth. Women, for example, were more likely to see an increase in sleep efficiency than men, and factors like relationship quality are likely to have a variety of impacts on both quality and efficiency of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for anyone who’s ever struggled to drift off when alone, the results are still cheering. Melatonin is all well and good — but a worn t-shirt could be the real secret to getting a good night’s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620905615?rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;amp;journalCode=pssa&quot;&gt;The Scent of a Good Night’s Sleep: Olfactory Cues of a Romantic Partner Improve Sleep Efficiency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Rampant panic buying, superstore shelves emptied of toilet paper, selfish people hoarding hand sanitizer. Worries about elderly relatives, jobs, money, health care costs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already have a serious anxiety disorder, how can you possibly cope in the current climate of fear and uncertainty? What if one of the core recommendations to help prevent disease transmission is the very pathology you've worked so hard to overcome?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contamination fears cause many individuals with OCD to compulsively wash their hands. Meanwhile, the directive to frequently wash your hands with soap &amp;amp; water for 20 seconds could be quite triggering for some. The International OCD Foundation has provided helpful resources:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iocdf.org/covid19/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Resources for the OCD and related disorders community during the COVID-19 outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;In times like these, what the experts are recommending temporarily becomes our new normal.  This may mean that you need to make some changes to your treatment, including which exposures you do, when you do them, how frequently, etc. What might normally be considered a “baseline” for people with OCD to aspire to should shift to match the recommended guidelines for as long as those guidelines are in place. A good suggestion would be to talk about the guidelines with your treatment team at your next session and go over how, if at all, your plan might change for the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important for all of us in the OCD and related disorders community to remember that this is temporary, and understand that it may feel uncomfortable. You are not going backwards in your recovery journey because the baseline changes. These troubled times will end, and you will keep doing your best in the meantime.&lt;/blockquote&gt;They also provide recommendations for what you should and should NOT do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Examples of &lt;b&gt;What to do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;set a time limit of 5 minutes &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;per day for reading news and updates from &lt;b&gt;trusted sources&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;take breaks and allow yourself to do things you enjoy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;consult your treatment team &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;u&gt;Examples of &lt;b&gt;What NOT to do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;avoid the temptation to learn “everything” about COVID-19&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;do not excessively wash your hands &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;don’t let “social distancing” rob you of your support networks &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;

Some patients on an acute psychiatric unit may be agitated, uncooperative, or even violent, and it’s not hard to imagine the distress of anyone who has a patient spit on them as we’re all trying to remember not to shake hands. Inevitably, there will be patients who present for psychiatric admission with no respiratory symptoms, who are admitted and then become ill and are diagnosed with COVID-19. In the meantime, the potential is there for contagion to other patients on the unit, the hospital staff, and visitors to the unit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Readers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; if you have any suggestions for helpful resources or personal coping strategies, feel free to comment here or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/neurocritic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;feedflare&quot;&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be the best-studied of all our senses, but surprises about the way our vision works just keep on coming. Recent research has startling and also salutary lessons about how we see.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39341&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your brain makes up a lot of what you “see”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re walking around or sitting at a desk, you no doubt feel that you can see pretty clearly all around you. Yes, so you might be looking ahead as you walk through a park, say, but you can see a rich world of grass, trees and people to either side of you. Well, you might be seeing it — but that doesn’t mean it’s all actually there. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797616672270&quot;&gt;research published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; in 2016&lt;/a&gt; revealed, your brain uses information from the clearly-focused central region of the visual field to fill in detail in the relatively data-poor periphery. In fact, as the lead author, Marte Otten at the University of Amsterdam, commented at the time, “Our findings show that, under the right circumstances, a large part of the periphery may be a visual illusion”. It’s what’s known as a “uniformity illusion”, and you can try it for yourself at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uniformillusion.com&quot;&gt;www.uniformillusion.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, not all peripheral vision is the same… &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/114/17/E3573&quot;&gt;work published the following year&lt;/a&gt; suggests that we all have “good” and “bad” regions. Some of the participants in this study, led by John Greenwood at UCL, had sharper left-side than right-side peripheral vision, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this could have real-world effects, says Greenwood — someone searching a room for missing keys, for example, could fail to spot those keys if they’re on their “bad” side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s easy to make someone hallucinate (without drugs)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a willing partner to hand, you can try one hallucination-inducing technique right now. All you have to do, according to research led by Giovanni Caputo and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/18/weird-things-start-to-happen-when-you-stare-into-someones-eyes-for-10-minutes/&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Psychiatry Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is to sit in chairs placed opposite each other, about a metre apart, in a fairly dimly lit room, and look into each other’s eyes. When the 20 young adults in the study tried this for 10 minutes, they reported all kinds of odd experiences. Along with altered perceptions of sounds and time, 90 per cent saw some deformed facial features, while three-quarters said they saw a monster. A state of dissociation might explain these results, the researchers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/09/researchers-show-there-is-a-simple-way-to-induce-synesthesia-in-people-with-normal-perception/&quot;&gt;published last year by Anupama Nair and David Brang&lt;/a&gt;, found that it’s possible to induce synaesthesia-type visual sensations in regular people. For this work, participants sat with their eyes closed in a darkened room for five minutes. Then they were given a simple mental imagery task, designed purely to raise activity levels in the visual cortex. During this task, occasional, unpredictably-timed beeps were played. Overall, nearly 60 per cent reported at least one sound-induced visual perception, such as seeing colourful small circles, flashes or sparkles of light or visual pulses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s known that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(14)00458-8?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982214004588?showall=true&quot;&gt;visual cortex processes auditory data, too&lt;/a&gt;. Short-term visual deprivation can, it seems, make it more likely that sounds will actually trigger visual hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time stops when you blink&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For about 10% of your waking hours, your eyes are actually shut, because of blinking. Your brain stitches together retinal information from around these gaps, giving you the impression that your vision is uninterrupted. However, these brief but regular dark moments do have an impact: a study led by Ayelet Landau suggests they cause your sense of the passing of time to stop temporarily. This work, published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; in 2019 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/14/your-brain-stops-time-when-you-blink/&quot;&gt;covered by me on the Research Digest&lt;/a&gt;, shows that processing in the visual cortex influences our perceptions of time. It’s possible that when we’re engaged in tasks that stimulate plenty of other senses (when we’re outside, say, rather than sitting at a desk, staring at a screen, reading about psychological research…), this effect could be counteracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can see infrared and ultraviolet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few animals, such as pit vipers and common vampire bats, are infamous for being able to sense the infrared body heat of their prey. This is not a human ability. In fact, we’re not meant to be able to detect infrared at all. However, as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/111/50/E5445&quot;&gt;initially serendipitous discovery by researchers at the University of Washington reveals&lt;/a&gt;, there are very particular circumstances in which it becomes possible. While working with an infrared laser, which is meant to be invisible to the human eye, researchers at the university reported seeing occasional green flashes. Vladimir Kefalov and colleagues investigated. They found that if two long-wavelength infrared photons of light hit a light-sensitive molecule in a cone cell in the retina in rapid succession, they have the same energy impact as a shorter, visible photon — and this triggers a green perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If such infrared vision is very rare, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/lastword/mg24432591-000-super-seers-why-some-people-can-see-ultraviolet-light/&quot;&gt;anecdotal reports&lt;/a&gt; that seeing very short, ultraviolet wavelengths of light — an ability normally associated with birds and butterflies, for instance — is much more achievable. The cornea and lens absorb this light, so, it’s true, we normally can’t see it. However, people who have had their lenses removed — often because of cataracts — have reported seeing (in blueish-purple) everything from patterns on flowers to ultraviolet light beams from counterfeit banknote detectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Childhood experience can create strange visual categories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It probably wouldn’t surprise you to learn that you have dedicated circuits of neurons in your visual cortex dedicated to processing particular categories of visual stimulus — such as one for faces, and another for words. But, it seems, these category regions are established through experience in childhood, and as long as your youthful experience with a given type of visual stimulus is intense enough, your visual cortex may well set up a dedicated response unit to handle it on into adulthood. The main recent evidence for this comes from a study by Jesse Gomez and his team, showing that adults who played Pokémon extensively as kids had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/06/14/adults-who-played-pokemon-extensively-in-childhood-have-a-pokemon-sensitive-region-in-their-visual-cortex/&quot;&gt;visual region that was more active when viewing Pokémon characters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you’re afraid, you literally see things differently&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a popular model of perception, what you see is generally a function of data coming from the retina to your brain and what your brain expects to see. Depending on the situation, sometimes the retinal data will be given more weight, but other times the brain will rely more on expectation in generating your visual perceptions. We all have a tendency to err on the side of caution — given the potential risk vs benefit, if you’re walking through snake-infested territory, say, it’s safer to see a long shape on the ground as a snake rather than a stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13854&quot;&gt;work published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; in 2017&lt;/a&gt; provided evidence that when our heart is beating rapidly — when we’re afraid (and perhaps also angry) — we’re especially likely to see threats when there are none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, racial biases also came into play. The team —Ruben Azevedo, Sarah Garfinkel, Hugo Critchley and Manos Tsakiris — showed images of either black or white individuals holding either a gun or a mobile phone. When the images were presented on the heartbeat, rather than between heartbeats, they were 10% more likely to see the object as a gun when it was held by a black person. The researchers think this effect might explain at least some shootings of black unarmed men by police officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/14/what-does-fear-do-to-our-vision/&quot;&gt;published a year earlier by Maria Lojowska’s team&lt;/a&gt;, found that when we’re afraid, we perceive some aspects of the world more clearly, but at the cost of ignoring much of the detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to mess with your colleagues’ minds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many optical illusions are presented in 2D, on paper, or on a computer screen. But in 2018, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/02/14/a-psychologist-noticed-this-cool-chair-illusion-in-his-office/&quot;&gt;mind-bending 3D chair illusion&lt;/a&gt; showed itself in the office of Nick Scott-Samuel at the University of Bristol. The set of stackable chairs seem to be arranged in an impossible position — a little like an Escher drawing, only stranger. This is because, Scott-Samuel and his colleagues report, the brain gets confused about apparent depth cues when &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/2041669517752372/suppl_file/StackingChairsMovie.mp4&quot;&gt;viewing the chairs at an angle&lt;/a&gt;. Just four chairs are apparently enough to achieve the effect. So next time you’re early for a meeting, you know what to do…&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_578&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/03/eleonora.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Image of Eleonora Presani, Executive Director of arXiv&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-578 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/03/eleonora-300x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Eleonora Presani, Executive Director&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s leading source of open access scientific research, is pleased to welcome Dr. Eleonora Presani as its first executive director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Presani earned her PhD in astroparticle physics at the University of Amsterdam and then completed her postdoc at CERN, where she worked remotely on the International Space Station’s AMS02 instrument. After that, she was publisher at Elsevier for high energy physics journals, and her projects included SCOAP3, SoftwareX, and Physics of the Dark Universe. In the last four years her career shifted to digital product development, working as Product Manager in Scopus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As executive director, Dr. Presani now leads arXiv’s operations, as well as technical and business planning, governance, and fundraising efforts. Based in New York City, she oversees a growing staff distributed across Cornell University’s Ithaca campus, Cornell Tech in NYC, and other locations. She also coordinates a global network of volunteer advisory board members and moderators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am honored and thrilled to take the helm of arXiv, a groundbreaking service with incredible potential for technological growth and innovative development,” Dr. Presani says. “arXiv was a ‘disrupter’ of traditional academic publishing before the world wide web became popular, and it continues to be a central point of global scientific knowledge sharing. I have been a user of arXiv since my undergraduate study in physics, and it was such an important source of information to me throughout my academic career, as it has been and continues to be for millions of researchers around the world. I look forward to engaging with the scientific and member advisory boards, as well as the larger, global community, to take us to the next level, and make this knowledge more accessible to everyone who wants it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Presani is passionate about bringing the art and complexities of technology to a wider audience, using accessible and creative methods. She also enjoys bridging together systems and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are very fortunate to have someone of Eleonora’s experience and background joining the arXiv team,” says Carol Hoover, member of arXiv’s Member Advisory Board (MAB) and Digital Information Resources Manager at Los Alamos National Laboratory Research Library. “She is a strong communicator with deep technical capabilities and has a solid understanding of arXiv’s purpose and mission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Licia Verde, chair of arXiv’s Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) and ICREA Professor, says, “We are proud that we can count on Eleonora, her skills, talents and expertise in scientific dissemination and the publishing ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv was founded in 1991 by physicist Paul Ginsparg and is a groundbreaking invention that popularized free, open-access scholarly research. Today, it continues to allow researchers from around the world to share scientific findings quickly, in fields ranging from astrophysics to economics. More than 180 moderators shepherd scholarly articles through the submission process, and more than 230 institutional members contribute financial support, in addition to the Simons Foundation, Cornell University, and other funders. arXiv has grown exponentially in the past decade, with more than 1.6 million submissions and more than a billion downloads in its 29-year history.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The human brain is often described as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-18233409&quot;&gt;most complex object in the known universe&lt;/a&gt; – we know so much, and yet so little, about the way it works. It’s no wonder then that the study of brain today encompasses an enormous range of topics, from abstract understanding of consciousness to microscopic exploration of billions of neurons. Brain Awareness Week takes place this year March 16-22. To mark the occasion, we’ve put together a list of books that explore the matter between your ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/birth-of-intelligence-9780190908324&quot;&gt;Birth of Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Daeyeol Lee &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is intelligence? Does a high level of biological intelligence require a complex brain? Can man-made machines be truly intelligent? In &lt;em&gt;Birth of Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;, distinguished neuroscientist Daeyeol Lee tackles pressing issues that will be key to preparing for future society and its technology, including how the use of AI will impact our lives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-not-to-train-the-brain-9780198789673&quot;&gt;How (not) to train the brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amir Raz and Sheida Rabipour &lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ENihhJkDjS0-143x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;143&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can we improve cognitive performance through deliberate training? The short answer is yes, albeit with some caveats. In this book, the authors review data from hundreds of articles and provide an overarching account of the field, separating scientific evidence from publicity myth and guiding readers through how they should – and should not – train the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-evolutionary-road-to-human-memory-9780198828051&quot;&gt;The Evolutionary Road to Human Memory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Elisabeth A. Murray, Steven P. Wise, Mary K. L. Baldwin, and Kim S. Graham &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book tells an intriguing story about how evolution shaped human memory. As our ancestors faced the problems and opportunities of their time, their brains developed new forms of memory that helped them gain an advantage in life. Sometime during human evolution, another new kind of memory emerged that ignited the human imagination, and empowered every individual, day upon day, to add new pages to the story of a life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/musical-illusions-and-phantom-words-9780190206833&quot;&gt;Musical Illusions and Phantom Words&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Diana Deutsch &lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EF4XXCFsD6Q-145x220.png&quot; width=&quot;145&quot; /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is perfect pitch so rare? Why do some people hallucinate music or speech? In this ground-breaking synthesis of art and science, Diana Deutsch, one of the world’s leading experts on the psychology of music, shows how illusions of music and speech—many of which she herself discovered—have fundamentally altered thinking about the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/sex-lies-and-brain-scans-9780198752882&quot;&gt;Sex, Lies, and Brain Scans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barbara J. Sahakian and Julia Gottwald &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sex, Lies, and Brain Scans&lt;/em&gt; takes readers beyond the media headlines. The authors consider what the technique of fMRI entails, and important ethical questions these techniques raise. Should individuals applying for jobs be screened for unconscious racial bias? How far will we allow neuroscience to go? It is time to make up our minds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-elephant-in-the-brain-9780190495992&quot;&gt;The Elephant in the Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Kevin Simler and Robin Hanson &lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EOGhBuYI0KI-145x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;145&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our brains are designed not just to hunt and gather, but also to help us get ahead socially, often via deception and self-deception. But while we may be self-interested schemers, we benefit by pretending otherwise. The less we know about our own ugly motives, the better – and thus we don’t like to talk or even think about the extent of our selfishness. This is “the elephant in the brain.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/your-brain-on-food-9780190932794&quot;&gt;Your Brain on Food, Third Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Gary L. Wenk &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This essential book vividly demonstrates how a little knowledge about the foods and drugs we eat can teach us a lot about how our brain functions. The intersection between brain science, drugs, food and our cultural and religious traditions is plainly illustrated in an entirely new light. Wenk tackles fundamental and fascinating questions, such as: &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://medium.com/@OUPAcademic/feed-an-injured-brain-fad1cb8b729d&quot;&gt;Are some foods better to eat after brain injury&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These books showcase some fascinating areas of brain research. But we’ve still got a long way to go before most of our questions about this intricate organ are answered. A comprehensive understanding of the brain is especially critical to combating public health issues, including rising rates of dementia and psychiatric disorders. As such, the continuing progress of brain research will be beneficial to us all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: Owned by Oxford University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/seven-books-on-the-fascinating-human-brain-reading-list/&quot;&gt;Seven books on the fascinating human brain [reading list]&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/619898700/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/619898700/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fENihhJkDjS0-143x220.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-importance-of-character-during-war/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The importance of character during war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/why-we-like-a-good-robot-story-2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why we like a good robot story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-olive-oil-promotes-brain-health/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How olive oil promotes brain health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<title type="html">A Vim script function to select signatures in Neomutt</title>
		<link href="http://ankursinha.in/2020/03/15/a-vimscript-function-to-select-signatures-in-neomutt.html"/>
		<id>tag:ankursinha.in,2020-03-15:/2020/03/15/a-vimscript-function-to-select-signatures-in-neomutt.html</id>
		<updated>2020-03-15T09:39:20+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;I've been using &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neomutt.org/&quot;&gt;Neomutt&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/2017/12/16/transitioning-to-neomutt-and-friends-for-e-mail.html&quot;&gt;while now&lt;/a&gt;.
It allows me to stick to the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.byobu.org/&quot;&gt;Byobu&lt;/a&gt; based terminal workflow that I'm used to.
Most importantly, it lets me use &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vim.org/&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; to write my e-mails, so I don't need to
really learn another tool now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neomutt.org/&quot;&gt;Neomutt&lt;/a&gt; can be configured to add a signature at the end of the e-mail, and one
can select a signature depending on various parameters, such as the senders
address using &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neomutt.org/man/neomuttrc&quot;&gt;hooks&lt;/a&gt;. However,
sometimes, one does need to select other signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vim.org/&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; way, of course, is to simply delete the last few lines, and
then read in the new signature using &lt;code&gt;:r &amp;lt;filename&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This takes a few
more key strokes than one would like (well, than I like) so I thought I'd
dabble in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)#Vim_script&quot;&gt;Vim script&lt;/a&gt; a bit and automate it. Here's what I've come up with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code vim literal-block&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&quot; A function to load the right signature when I'm using neomutt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; LoadSignature&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;signature&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;    &quot; Only work for mail files&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; this_file_type &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;filetype&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; this_file_type &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;mail&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        echo &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;This is not a mail file! Not running!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;endif&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
    &quot; Get the current signature's line&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;    &quot; Go to last line&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; saved_cursor_position &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; getpos&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;    &quot; Set cursor to file end and search backwards&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; cursor&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;99999999999999999999&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;:sigstart &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; search&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'-- '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;    &quot; Confirm that the line was found&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; sigstart &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
        echo &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;No signatures detected.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;endif&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
    &quot; Check if signature file exists&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;:sigdir &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; escape&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;expand&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'$HOME'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'\'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; . &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/Sync/99_private/neomuttdir/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;:sigfile &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; sigdir . &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;:signature . &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;.sig&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; filereadable&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sigfile&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;        &quot; delete the current lines after the &quot;-- &quot; line&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;:delstart &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; sigstart &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
        execute delstart . &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;,$d&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;        &quot; Read the new signature&lt;/span&gt;
        execute sigstart . &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;read &quot;&lt;/span&gt; . sigfile
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;        &quot; Return cursor to wherever it was&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; setpos&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; saved_cursor_position&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
        echo &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;File &quot;&lt;/span&gt; . sigfile . &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot; not found!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        echo &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Available signature files:\n&quot;&lt;/span&gt; . globpath&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sigdir&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'*.sig'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;endif&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;endfunction&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, adding this to &lt;code&gt;~/.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; would let one run &lt;code&gt;:call
LoadSignature('signature')&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vim.org/&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; to select a signature. Each signature is a
different file with a &lt;code&gt;.sig&lt;/code&gt; file extension in the location given by
&lt;code&gt;sigdir&lt;/code&gt;, and the name of the file is the argument that needs to be given
to the function. If the signature file cannot be found, it'll list available ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's quite simple really, and I'm sure it can be made better, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This episode is an exploration of glial cells with R Douglas Fields, author of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2W5xVfA&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;amazon&quot;&gt;The Other Brain: The Scientific and Medical Breakthroughs That Will Heal Our Brains and Revolutionize Our Health&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; Glial Cells outnumber the neurons in our nervous system, but until the last few years they were thought to merely support cells. Dr. Fields takes us through the discovery that they have their own signaling methods and are much more important than we ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This interview first aired in 2010, but Dr. Fields reviewed the original transcript and made no significant corrections.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">
 &lt;p&gt;As the global impact of COVID-19 becomes apparent, we write to share updates relevant to the arXiv community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, arXiv is unaffected by the outbreak and continues to operate as usual. Our intention is to maintain the same speed and service that our community values so deeply. As arXiv’s scientific director Steinn Sigurdsson said, “With quarantines and major conferences being cancelled, arXiv will be as important as ever to sharing research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we acknowledge that our team is global, and the situation is evolving rapidly. Our highest priority is the health and safety of our community, and we recognize that staff and volunteer moderators may need to take time off to address their personal well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we plan to keep papers flowing as much as possible, we need to accept that delays might happen. We hope that by keeping open communication among moderators, staff, and users, we can avoid any major disruptions. If your paper is delayed, we graciously ask for your patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, we’ve added a&lt;a href=&quot;https://status.arxiv.org&quot;&gt; status page&lt;/a&gt; that will allow anyone to monitor and subscribe to updates around arXiv’s operational status, including planned maintenance, unscheduled outages, and other events that may affect the availability of arXiv services. More information about the status page is available on our recent&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2020/03/02/communicating-arxivs-operational-status/&quot;&gt; blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience and understanding during this complicated moment.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Today, PLOS joins a list of endorsers of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openpharma.blog/position-statement-on-open-access/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Position Statement on Open Access&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; coordinated by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openpharma.blog/about-us/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Open Pharma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, a group of pharmaceutical clients, publishers, patients, academics, regulators, editors, non-pharmaceutical funders, and societies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS is a fully Open Access publisher, with all content published with a CC-BY license. We are  therefore ready to support the aims of Open Pharma without delay or need to alter policies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We support any and all moves to open science, and to improve the integrity of research. The pharmaceutical industry &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openpharma.blog/position-statement-on-open-access/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;funds roughly half&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; of all biomedical research, yet has been slower to adopt the Open Access and Open Science policies that are now becoming mainstream. Our hope, by endorsing this position statement, is to ensure the pharmaceutical industry understands it is just as welcome and able to submit to PLOS journals as any other research group. Our robust editorial policies, open data policy, and Open Science mission will help the industry validate and demonstrate the credibility of its work. We look forward to continued collaboration to improve medical science and patient care. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We have been telling stories about machines with minds for almost three thousand years. In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095957574&quot;&gt;Iliad&lt;/a&gt;, written around 800 BCE, Homer describes the oldest known AI: “golden handmaidens” created by Hephaestus, the disabled god of metalworking. They “seemed like living maidens” with “intelligence… voice and vigour”, and “bustled about supporting their master.” In &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199546091.001.0001/acref-9780199546091-e-8365?rskey=Q1Xhgy&amp;amp;result=1&quot;&gt;the Odyssey&lt;/a&gt;, Homer also gave us the first autonomous vehicles — the self-sailing ships that take Odysseus home to Ithaca, navigating “by thought,” along with biomimetic robots — a pair of silver and gold watchdogs which guard a palace not with teeth and claws but with their “intelligent minds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such stories have been told continually ever since. They come in a wide range of forms: myths and legends, apocryphal tales, film and fiction, and serious-minded speculations about the future. Today more than ever, intelligent machines are staples of blockbusters and bestsellers, from &lt;em&gt;Star Wars &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Westworld&lt;/em&gt; to Ian McEwan’s &lt;em&gt;Machines Like Me&lt;/em&gt;. Currently, we might call such machines “AI” — artificial intelligence — a term coined in 1955. But they have had many other names, all of which have different nuances, including “automaton” (since antiquity), “android” (1728), “robot” (1921), and “cyborg” (1960). It seems that thinking machines are, as Claude Lévi-Strauss once said of animals, good to think with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? A few scholars have tried to explain this fascination with humanoid machines. The first was Ernst Jentsch, who claimed in his 1906 essay “&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.art3idea.psu.edu/locus/Jentsch_uncanny.pdf&quot;&gt;On the Psychology of the Uncanny&lt;/a&gt;” that “in storytelling, one of the most reliable artistic devices for producing uncanny effects easily is to leave the reader in uncertainty as to whether he has a human person or rather an automaton before him.” He illustrated this with a brief mention of the 1816 short story &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~art3idea.psu.edu/metalepsis/texts/sandman.pdf&quot;&gt;“The Sandman”&lt;/a&gt; by E.T.A. Hoffmann, which features a young man Nathanael, enchanted by the beautiful Olimpia, who lives in the house opposite with her father. She is an excellent dancer, but does not speak beyond saying “Ah-ah!” Nonetheless, Nathanael is so distraught when he discovers the object of his rapture is in fact an automaton, constructed by her “father,” that he commits suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his essay &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://commapress.co.uk/resources/online-short-stories/the-uncanny-sigmund-freud/&quot;&gt;“The Uncanny”&lt;/a&gt; a few years later, Sigmund Freud further developed this idea — and in so doing made that term a staple of literary analysis. But his analysis of ‘The Sandman’ actually diverts attention away from Olimpia’s artificial nature, and towards something quite different: “the theme of the [mythical] ‘Sand-Man’ who tears out children’s eyes.” The notion of the uncanny has nonetheless remained central to thinking about our reaction to human-like machines to this day: the Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori famously coined the term &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254060168_The_Uncanny_Valley_From_the_Field&quot;&gt;“uncanny valley”&lt;/a&gt; to describe the unsettling effect of being confronted with a machine that is almost, but not quite, human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.umsl.edu/~umslhistory/Faculty/kang.html&quot;&gt;Minsoo Kang&lt;/a&gt; argued in his book &lt;em&gt;Sublime Dreams of Living Machines&lt;/em&gt; (2011) that Freud is wrong to only focus on the fears associated with automata, such as being deceived by a machine into thinking that it is human as in the case of “The Sandman.” Throughout history people have also linked hopes and positive feelings to automata. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.brynmawr.edu/people/elly-truitt&quot;&gt;E.R. Truitt&lt;/a&gt;, writes in her book &lt;em&gt;Medieval Robots&lt;/em&gt; (2015) about the chateau of Hesdin in medieval France, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;amp;httpsredir=1&amp;amp;article=1850&amp;amp;context=mff&quot;&gt;where automata pulled pranks on unsuspecting visitors&lt;/a&gt;; or Star Wars fans might think of the comic relief provided by the robots C-3PO and R2-D2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kang’s own view is that the humanoid machine is fascinating because it is “the ultimate categorical anomaly. Its very nature is a series of contradictions, and its purpose is to flaunt its own insoluble paradox.” The uncanny is one aspect of this, in challenging the categories of the real and the unreal. But is it not the whole story, as such machines also challenge our divisions between, for example, the living and the dead, or creatures and objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kang’s analysis is surely right — but again, not the whole story. Writer and critic Victoria Nelson added &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.eaas.eu/publications/book-reviews/104-victoria-nelson-the-secret-life-of-puppets&quot;&gt;another piece of the puzzle&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that repressed religious beliefs motivate many of the stories we tell about humanoid machines. This too seems right. Classicist Adrienne Mayor describes mythical tales of intelligent machines as “&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://phys.org/news/2019-03-ancient-myths-reveal-early-fantasies.html&quot;&gt;ancient thought experiments&lt;/a&gt;” in the potential of technology to transform the human condition. This too seems like an important function, and we argue in the book that stories — in particular, the last hundred years of science fiction — offer the most nuanced explorations available of life with AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So one explanation for why humanoid robots are so good to think with is that they can fulfil so many functions, and be by turns unsettling, funny, or thought-provoking. To this we want to add another piece: in a way, they can be what we want them to be, unbounded by what would count as “realistic” for a human. In this, they can fulfill narrative roles akin to those of gods or demons, embodying archetypes and superlatives: the ruthless unstoppable killer, the perfect lover, or the cerebral, ultra-rational calculating machine. They allow us to explore extremes — which is one reason why robot stories tend towards the utopian or dystopian. Stories about such machines are therefore always really stories about ourselves: parodying, probing, or problematizing our notions of what it means to be human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credits by Pete Linforth from &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~image%20by%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https://pixabay.com/users/TheDigitalArtist-202249/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;amp;utm_content=3486900%22%3EPete%20Linforth%3C/a%3E%20from%20%3Ca%20href=%22https%3A//pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;amp;utm_content=3486900%22%3EPixabay%3C/a%3E&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/why-we-like-a-good-robot-story/&quot;&gt;Why we like a good robot story&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/619728956/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/619728956/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/619728956/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/619728956/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/619728956/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/619728956/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/619728956/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/619728956/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/619728956/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/619728956/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-importance-of-character-during-war/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The importance of character during war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/why-we-like-a-good-robot-story-2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why we like a good robot story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-surprising-scientific-value-of-national-bias/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The surprising scientific value of national bias&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/World-Kidney-day-2020-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 850 million people worldwide.  This global health burden continues to increase each year.  There are no symptoms in early CKD.  It is not until CKD has progressed to the point of needing dialysis that patients develop recognizable symptoms.  This means that it is vital that patients are screened for CKD, since early diagnosis can prevent the progression of kidney disease.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldkidneyday.org/2020-campaign/2020-wkd-theme/&quot;&gt;World Kidney Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on 12th March 2020 will focus on &lt;strong&gt;“Kidney Health for Everyone Everywhere – from Prevention to Detection and Equitable Access to Care”&lt;/strong&gt;.  Primary care providers (PCPs) are on the frontline against CKD progression by making the early diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-01731-x&quot;&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; by Neale &lt;em&gt;et al., &lt;/em&gt;published today in &lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology,&lt;/em&gt; evaluated the barriers and enablers to the diagnosis and management of CKD in primary care.  Most reviews focus on barriers&lt;em&gt; or&lt;/em&gt; enablers but this article was able to address both, which go hand-in-hand in helping PCPs tackle the growing health burden of CKD.  Twenty studies were included in the review. The most common barriers identified were lack of time, fear of delivering the CKD diagnosis, and dissatisfaction with CKD guidelines.  The most common enablers were the presence of supportive technology to identify and manage CKD and collaborative relationships among members of the healthcare team. These and some other identified barriers and enablers from Neale &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;are listed in table 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11768&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11768 size-large&quot; height=&quot;345&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Worl-Kidney-Day-Blog_Table1-1-1024x552.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 1: Management and Detection of CKD in Primary Healthcare.  The most common are highlighted orange. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategies to Enhance Early Detection and Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare professionals frequently complain of the inadequate amount of time they can spend with patients. However, PCPs have one of the highest workloads, managing preventative care, acute complaints, multiple co-morbidities, etc.  Developing strategies to streamline the identification and management of CKD through electronic medical records and increasing the use of calculators for estimated GFR and kidney failure risk would benefit PCPs.  In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/350/bmj.h176.full.pdf&quot;&gt;adopting policies&lt;/a&gt; that enable longer consultations for complex patients will allow protected time to deal with the management of chronic diseases like CKD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective co-management of patients with CKD between PCPs and nephrologists is recognized as a key strategy to deliver high-quality CKD care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving CKD knowledge and confidence in diagnosis will empower PCPs to provide early diagnosis.  If patients know they have CKD in the primary care setting, they can take steps to increase their own CKD knowledge and self-management of CKD, promoting future favorable outcomes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0272638614010610?token=595049B828280D60DE74EE3A6F2A4F0DFFA62F5357753C421BE25E03C6210DA1999D18113CA869B6495D8EF3AB581D07&quot;&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; implemented a toolkit to enhance awareness of CKD among PCPs.  This quality improvement activity led to greater identification of CKD, increased referral to nephrology, increased communication among PCPs and nephrologists, and the development of co-management plans. Toolkits like this one should be used more frequently for providing continuing education and resources for our PCPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidelines rarely deal with comorbidities, but practice guidelines that consider the co-morbid nature of CKD would increase understanding and use among PCPs.  It will help with prioritizing the patient’s problem list and management strategies.  One potential solution is to develop guidelines that consider common clusters of chronic conditions. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.european-renal-best-practice.org/content/erbp-documents-topic&quot;&gt;ERBP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kdigo.org/guidelines/&quot;&gt;KDIGO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kidney.org/professionals/guidelines/guidelines_commentaries&quot;&gt;KDOQI&lt;/a&gt; have already started to address this by providing guidelines on CKD and co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hepatitis C, and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11606-019-04975-y.pdf&quot;&gt;Effective co-management of patients&lt;/a&gt; with CKD between PCPs and nephrologists is recognized as a key strategy to deliver high-quality CKD care.  Interventions facilitating the exchange of information, clear delineation of roles/responsibilities, and greater access to specialist advice improve the co-management of patients with CKD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCPs and nephrologists working together in a multi-disciplinary team to care of these complex patients can only lead to future healthcare benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Ohki Katakura will talk about the paper &quot;Spatiotemporal network coding of physiological mossy fiber inputs by the cerebellar granular layer&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The granular layer, which mainly consists of granule and Golgi cells, is the first stage of the cerebellar cortex and processes spatiotemporal information transmitted by mossy fiber inputs with a wide variety of firing patterns. To study its dynamics at multiple time scales in response to inputs approximating real spatiotemporal patterns, we constructed a large-scale 3D network model of the granular layer. Patterned mossy fiber activity induces rhythmic Golgi cell activity that is synchronized by shared parallel fiber input and by gap junctions. This leads to long distance synchrony of Golgi cells along the transverse axis, powerfully regulating granule cell firing by imposing inhibition during a specific time window. The essential network mechanisms, including tunable Golgi cell oscillations, on-beam inhibition and NMDA receptors causing first winner keeps winning of granule cells, illustrate how fundamental properties of the granule layer operate in tandem to produce (1) well timed and spatially bound output, (2) a wide dynamic range of granule cell firing and (3) transient and coherent gating oscillations. These results substantially enrich our understanding of granule cell layer processing, which seems to promote spatial group selection of granule cell activity as a function of timing of mossy fiber input.&lt;/p&gt;

The authors of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12920-019-0612-6?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedgenomics.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;BMC Medical Genomics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; discuss the topic further in this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A case of genetic testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samila* had been suffering from shortness of breath and exhaustion when, at the age of 19, she was diagnosed with a heart that did not pump properly. Attempting to understand what caused this condition, her cardiologist suggested genetic testing. The test showed no underlying genetic factors for her heart issues and her medication was so effective that Samila thought it all might have been a fluke. However, when she was 26, her cardiologist unexpectedly contacted her with some upsetting information: part of her DNA had been identified as being involved in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Fictionalized case&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genetic testing: uncertainty amidst possible expectations of certainty &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A genetic test inspects parts or even the entirety of the genome, which contains all our hereditary information encoded in the DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of human genetics studies the workings of human genomes and how variations within it might play a role in the development of medical conditions. Through these studies, our genes can offer us important insights into why we have developed certain conditions, whether we could develop them in the future, and whether our children are at increased risk of developing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We frequently attribute a great deal of certainty to genetic testing and the information it produces in terms of what it can tell us regarding current and future health risks. However, for all our expectations, the connection between our genes and discuss our health is anything but clear-cut. The information provided by genetic testing often contains a multitude of uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such uncertainty is that the meaning of genetic information can change over time. Depending on the moment a genetic test is performed or its data interpreted, patients may receive different results. This can be unsettling for patients and pose a real challenge to genetic professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stable genomes, changing understandings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People change, their genomes do not. Our genome is inherited at conception and generally stays constant beyond the day we die. Patients like Samila may, therefore, wonder why they receive new genetic information many years later after their DNA was initially “cleared”. Despite its fixed nature, our understanding and interpretation of the genome is anything but stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing enables us to inspect an individual genome for variations that differ from a template (i.e. ‘the’ human reference genome). Everyone has millions of variations that differ from this reference, but most are harmless or even beneficial. For patients, then, we need to establish whether these variations can explain or predict conditions or whether they are innocent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11758&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Suspect gene&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11758 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;198&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Fig-1-300x198.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Professionals in human genetics might be likened to molecular detectives. &lt;em&gt;Illustration by Julia El Mecky.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, geneticists are kind of molecular detectives. They uncover evidence in order to ascertain whether their “suspects” – i.e. variations in an individual’s genome – are guilty or innocent regarding the development of specific conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complicating the task of reviewing evidence, like in an actual criminal investigation, is that new evidence might unfold as time passes. This new evidence may redefine how genetic variation might be involved in medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Samila’s case, for instance, it was uncertain if some of the initially identified genetic variation was harmless or suspicious. But as time went on, more patients with the same condition appeared to have this genetic variation, which indeed could be associated with cardiomyopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New evidence: important implications for patients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11759&quot; style=&quot;width: 270px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Guilty gene&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11759 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Fig-2-260x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;260&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;New evidence can change the “verdict” that is given to genetic variation. &lt;em&gt;Illustration by Julia El Mecky&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolving genetic evidence can have significant implications for patients and their relatives in terms of treatment decisions, medical protocols, and life decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Samila’s case, this new interpretation indicated a chronic heart condition that was likely to progress, irrespective of any treatment. Samila was advised to look for a job that was not too stressful. Her children have a 50% chance of having the genetic variation, putting them at higher risk of developing a similar condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Challenges for professionals in genetic healthcare&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New genetic technologies produce information regarding genetic variation at unprecedented rates, continuously providing new data on the relationship between genetic variation and medical conditions as time moves on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changing nature of genetic knowledge raises highly challenging questions for professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, a laboratory geneticist’s role is to interpret the meaning of genetic variation. What are their responsibilities with respect to identifying and providing up-to-date, important health information to individuals who have been tested in the past?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If laboratories would enact a policy of routinely inspecting all new evidence and update the interpretation of genetic data in their registry, patients such as Samila could receive vital medical information at an earlier time. Samila might then have considered measures to prevent her children from inheriting the genetic variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the workload for professionals to review massive amounts of new evidence is exorbitant and would strain resources, potentially cutting into time spent on other healthcare-related activities. Should the responsibility therefore lie with Samila or her primary care practitioner to regularly request updated interpretations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial that these issues are explored through research that includes the perspectives of those involved. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12920-019-0612-6?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;looks at these questions in the context of the genetic laboratory. We invite everyone interested to read this paper, which raises important points of consideration for clinical genetics practice.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/19432_text_animation_re-size-150x150.gif&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We’re excited to share a new logo and a new “look” for PLOS! The new visuals you’ll see are a reflection of a broader set of important changes happening here over the past few years. This post gives a little bit of context about the “why” behind this work (and for the design nerds  more keenly interested in the background and some of our process… this is for you!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;So much has changed… but our “look” hadn’t. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Scientific communication has changed since PLOS’ original founding (transforming it has been our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/about/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; from the very beginning). Open Access is no longer a new idea. And while PLOS remains one of the original pioneers of OA in the global north, Open Access itself is increasingly mainstream. Yet, our look, feel, and color palette has been static for 7+years. And the PLOS “globe” logo had been essentially unchanged since our founding in 2003. (That’s a long time!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Developing a “look” true to PLOS’ roots, while truly visually new, felt daunting at times. Could we develop a visual brand reflective of the trust our communities place in us that ALSO shows our energy and willingness to break boundaries along the way? Can we capture both our expertise AND daring? And could our “look” channel the passion and excitement we experience daily in our work with researchers all over the world?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We knew we wanted to maintain a connection between the old and new. This work hasn’t been about starting from scratch but about moving forward. Here’s a peek behind the scenes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The design process&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We were voracious in seeking out inspiration, resulting in many, many storyboards from our incredibly talented in-house designer (more about her later…). While we’d love to share all her research, here’s a snapshot of some of our favorite themes: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=old+space+posters&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiIlPy_6PLnAhVHh60KHbbgDPwQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;amp;oq=old+space+posters&amp;amp;gs_l=img.12...0.0..21020...0.0..0.0.0.......0......gws-wiz-img.188YLLhhl_Y&amp;amp;ei=b0dYXsigBseOtgW2wbPgDw&amp;amp;bih=930&amp;amp;biw=1557&amp;amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS887&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vintage space posters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Beautiful on their own, these also call back to the original PLOS “globe”. Please click on that link to see a range of examples!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bold use of color: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Building on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;new &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;bold color palette&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; (launched in 2018) our new approach to color gives us a daring and different, yet professional look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/color-on-color.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-9096 size-large&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/color-on-color-1024x540.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use of overlapping shapes: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We’ve created interesting details by zooming in and out; layering colors and transparencies; and creating new, more complex shapes by overlapping simpler ones. This was inspired by our intersecting communities and the multiple ways we work with them!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/PLOS-rebrand-overlapping-shapes-images.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9097&quot; height=&quot;278&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/PLOS-rebrand-overlapping-shapes-images-1024x278.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;And here’s our logo’s journey, with the final result!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/logo-journey.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9098&quot; height=&quot;192&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/logo-journey-1024x192.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We hope you like the final result as much as we do. Take a look around &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plos.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;www.plos.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and you’ll see our inspiration in action. Today’s launch is the beginning. Over the coming weeks and months, you’ll see all PLOS visuals and collateral evolve in line with this new direction!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are incredibly lucky to have such creative talent within our team at PLOS — none of this process was outsourced to a design agency. The entire PLOS rebrand was researched and developed by our Senior Manager for Marketing Creative, Masami Overstreet. The website development, migration, and redesign incorporating the rebrand, was carried out by Ian Hamilton of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.colorcrate.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;ColorCrate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. Thanks to them, and everyone else involved in this refresh. And, thank YOU for reading!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About PLOS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS is a nonprofit, Open Access publisher empowering researchers to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication. We’ve been breaking boundaries since our founding in 2001. PLOS journals propelled the movement for OA alternatives to subscription journals. We established the first multi-disciplinary publication inclusive of all excellent research regardless of novelty or impact, and demonstrated the importance of open data availability. As Open Science advances, we continue to experiment to provide more opportunities, choice, and context for readers and researchers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/placenta-2433431_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost every animal on the planet which produces a placenta eats it after birth. There are only a few exceptions to this rule – aquatic animals, camels, and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, humans are so averse to eating our own placentas after birth that it has not been recorded by any culture anywhere in the world in all of human history. We have buried them, burned them and occasionally sold them as medicine to other people, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03670244.2010.524106?casa_token=FRqe63-3CvwAAAAA%3A8UeE7jzb_OoZFMOjR5MnZKqzSlvG2YrCDtoXn8r1cyYnXK-eA_RMtkOrxHGsOQXvEJa_c2T33oPU&quot;&gt;as far as we know&lt;/a&gt;, we have never routinely eaten our own. That is, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03670244.2012.719356?journalCode=gefn20&quot;&gt;until the 1970s&lt;/a&gt;, when the practice started spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Post-partum human maternal placentophagy” is the term for the phenomena of the birthing parent eating their own placenta after they have given birth. It is something which existing research indicates is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03670244.2012.719356?journalCode=gefn20&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;done almost exclusively by married, heterosexual, middle- or upper-class white women in the Global North&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to answer that question, we can look in the place where people are already talking about it: the internet. More specifically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-2824-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;our research&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, looked at threads posted on the UK parenting forums Mumsnet and Netmums and analysed them to see if common themes could be established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parenting forums can be important spaces for women to seek advice, including about placentophagy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we found was that people usually decide to eat their placentas because they either previously had, or felt they were at risk of, a negative experience during birth and the post-partum period. Most commonly, these were women who had existing mental health problems or had previously experienced post-natal depression (PND) and were worried about a recurrence. PND can be an awful, isolating and stigmatized condition and people were willing to seek a broad range of possible preventative measures – including eating their placenta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rationale for this is that in the immediate postpartum period, the birthing parent experiences a large and sudden drop in pregnancy-related hormones that can result in low mood and energy. The placenta produces a lot of those hormones and so re-ingesting it could replace some of them. The theory is that taking placenta in the form of an encapsulated pill once or twice a day over a period of time can mitigate some of that loss and therefore reduce or treat depression, induce lactation, boost mood, reduce cramps, improve energy and so on. According to existing research, there is no evidence that this is true (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1871519217302081?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;fairly good evidence&lt;/a&gt; that it has no impact on these things), but that does not stop the popularity of the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Popularity of placentophagy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few potential factors increasing this popularity. Nobody finds the idea of eating a placenta particularly appetizing. The practice of encapsulation (steaming and/or dehydrating, grinding up and placing the placenta into capsules) helps alleviate the potential unpleasantness, making the practice palatable to more people. This process costs somewhere between £100-400 to pay someone else to do. For those who are handy, there are DIY guides and kits that can be purchased online. Some may instead choose to mix the placenta with fruit in a smoothie, or consume it some other way, but encapsulation is by far the most popular method. The media attention on the topic has also helped push it into the public view and the internet is being used as a tool for sharing logistical information and overcoming potential barriers to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Placentophagy can be understood as a way of exerting control and managing fears around birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data we looked at also demonstrated that parenting forums can be important spaces for women to establish normative parenting values and seek advice, including about placentophagy. Whilst there were the expected jokes about it, there was also an emphasis on personal choice, bodily autonomy and the value of each other’s experiences to support those who had done or were considering the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivations and concerns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that placentophagy can be understood as being practiced as a way of exerting control and managing fears around birth and the birthing experience. It is medically legitimized through its similarity to medication and the sterile procedures used to create the “pills,” yet there is also an element of eschewing medical or scientific advice and seeking knowledge from people who have been in the same situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some understandable concerns about the practice. Seeking to address the issue oneself may cause a delay in seeking treatment for PND or other post-natal problems and there is a small concern about potential infection risk if the process is not sterile. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/birt.12354&quot;&gt;large medical records study in the USA&lt;/a&gt; found no evidence of adverse outcomes associated with the practice, which is reassuring, but may not be applicable to other countries where methods may vary subtly or significantly. When it is brought up in clinical practice, healthcare professionals should be able to non-judgmentally and openly discuss with pregnant people the available medical evidence, or lack thereof, for placentophagy. They should also explore the reasons why someone might be considering it and if there is any additional support they want or need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-jetpack-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you’re beginning to use Python daily. Great! You might still have a critical set of Matlab scripts from back in the day that doesn’t have a neat equivalent in Python. How do you rewrite this code in Python without introducing many headaches? I’ve had to do this a handful of times and have developed a method based on test-driven development that avoids the biggest issues in code translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define what you want to translate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a test plan based on existing code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write tests in Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the code in Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterate until tests pass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the method, I’ve migrated a script that I found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19709635&quot;&gt;Susillo and Abbott (2009)&lt;/a&gt;. It simulates a chaotic neural network and trains it with recursive least-squares. I wanted to make sure I would run into issues (gotchas!) when I translated the code to exercise the method – and I did run into issues! The method I’m outlining highlighted the translation bugs early and helped squash them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is part 3 of my guide on transitioning from Matlab to Python. Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/&quot;&gt;part 1: a curriculum to learn Python&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/&quot;&gt;part 2: choosing environments, IDEs and packages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pick your battles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algorithmic code that does matrix manipulation is typically a good candidate for translation into Python. Importantly, the code you will translate needs to currently run in Matlab, since we’re going to have to run the code and capture its current behaviour. &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/build-python-c-extension-module/&quot;&gt;Mex code can be repurposed pretty straightforwardly into a Python extension&lt;/a&gt;, keeping the core C numerics intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to avoid direct translation of code with dependencies on Simulink, GUIDE, or esoteric toolboxes. For GUIDE in particular, I’ve found that the limitations of GUIDE enforce a certain style of coding – lots of globals and convoluted logic. You’re probably better off rewriting the GUI code from scratch than attempting direct translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every piece of Matlab code needs to be translated to Python. If your goal is to archive an existing pipeline so it continues to run despite deprecation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile&quot;&gt;containerizing Matlab with Docker&lt;/a&gt; is a good route. You can also call legacy Matlab code from Python directly using the official Matlab engine for Python from Mathworks or using shell calls. However, some situations will &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; translating Matlab code, for instance, if you want to run your code in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, consider doing the process for a smaller project first. It’s not that easy! You will learn a lot from doing this once on a smaller scale. I recommend that you &lt;a href=&quot;https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/&quot;&gt;create a git repo for your project and commit regularly&lt;/a&gt;, because you might be doing a lot of iterations to get everything to run correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating a test-based strategy for rewriting the code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve identified a good script or function to rewrite. Should we start writing Python? No! It is very easy to rewrite code in another language that &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; to work, but has subtle bugs. You can spend days or weeks chasing down these bugs, and it will drive you crazy! For this reason, we will use a test-based strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capture what the behaviour of the code is &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt; for a variety of inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewrite the code in Python and make sure it does exactly the thing that we want it to do. That is, for the same inputs, it gives us the same outputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing&quot;&gt;We will create unit tests to verify the behaviour of our code is correct&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that it matches the old code exactly. At this point, you may say – &lt;em&gt;hold on, I don’t just want to transfer the code over, I want to improve it&lt;/em&gt;! Our goal is to capture the logic part of the code – the number-crunching. This does not stop us from improving the reference code in a number of ways, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making constants changeable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making the code more modular&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Pythonic data structures, for example using &lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt; to store time series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we have to build on a solid foundation – a reference. Once we replicate the original behaviour and commit it to a repo, we can improve it later in a new commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Identify inputs and outputs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to identify the inputs and outputs of the script or function we want to rewrite. One very nice thing about Matlab is that functions tend to be stateless and do not modify their arguments (unless an input is a reference object type, which is pretty rare). Thus, we can reason pretty easily about the inputs and the outputs to a function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The inputs are the arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The outputs are the return variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions may have side-effects, such as creating a plot or saving a file. A side-effect to a function is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)&quot;&gt;an observable effect besides returning a value (the main effect) to the invoker of the operation&lt;/a&gt;. If the code you’re translating has side-effects, you should aim to remove them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, consider a function takes in data and returns nothing, saving the results to disk, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-matlab&quot;&gt;function [] = mycomplexop(outfile)
    data = zeros(100, 100);
    % Complex things happen in the middle...
    save(outfile, 'data');
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can transform this into a side-effect-free function by returning the results instead of saving them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-matlab&quot;&gt;function [data] = mycomplexop()
    data = zeros(100, 100);
    % Complex things happen in the middle...
    return
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer to comment out plotting code rather than trying to replicate it exactly. Again, we want to focus on the number crunching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Identify test cases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Matlab scripts are written in a style where the inputs to a function are set up, a function or set of functions are called, and then the output is plotted. We need to capture the inputs to this set of functions as well as the inputs. An easy way to do this is using &lt;code&gt;save&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-matlab&quot;&gt;% Set up the inputs.
t = 0:1000;
dt = .1;
g = 10;

save inputs.mat -hdf5

% Call the function
complexoutput = mycomplexfun(t, dt, g);

save outputs.mat -hdf5

% Plotting the output
plot(t, complexoutput);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used Octave here – but you can use &lt;code&gt;-v7.3&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;-hdfd5&lt;/code&gt; to save if you’re using Matlab. &lt;code&gt;mat&lt;/code&gt; files saved in these formats are actually hdf5 files that Python can read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay special attention to randomization. It will be hard to replicate Matlab’s random number generation exactly in Python. Ideally, functions should be independent of randomizations, because functions with random outputs are very hard to test for correctness. If a function requires random variables to implement an algorithm, we can circumvent this issue by giving the function the random data it needs. For example, let’s say we have a function that computes the distribution of the range of a random normal variable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-matlab&quot;&gt;function [dist] = rangedist()
    A = randn(100, 1000);
    dist = max(A, 1) - min(A, 1);
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can rewrite this function so that its source of randomness comes from outside the function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-matlab&quot;&gt;function [dist] = rangedist(A)
    dist = max(A, 1) - min(A, 1);
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we can generate the &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; variable in a script, and save that particular random draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to pick test cases that won’t take more than a few seconds to run. You will be running your tests many times, and these seconds will add up! Toy data is fine. It’s also good practice to test our code on simple inputs where the correct output is clear, for example, all zeros, all ones, etc. Save as many input-output pairs as is necessary to capture the range of behaviours of functions you want to capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to testing our script end-to-end, we may choose to test intermediate computations involved in the script. Testing more fine-grained computations will help you debug your code. If your function is already written as a function, it may call private functions – which can make things a bit tricky. You may need to refactor a bit of the Matlab code to make private functions public so that you can capture both their inputs and outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Writing a test scaffold&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit testing checks whether the results of a function are as expected given a set of inputs. Testing in Python can range from using simple inline &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; statements to sophisticated automated solutions that check that tests pass every time you push code into your repo. In our case, we will use a lightweight manual testing method: hiding test cases behind &lt;code&gt;__name__ == '__main__'&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will create a python module that is meant to be imported, for example, via &lt;code&gt;import mymodule&lt;/code&gt;. When we run the file on the command line, however, via &lt;code&gt;python module.py&lt;/code&gt;, the code hidden behind this &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement will be run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;import numpy as np

def my_complex_fun(A):
    # Complicated things occur.
    return A * 2

def _run_tests():
    # Load inputs.
    with h5py.File('inputs.mat', 'r') as f:
        A = np.array(f['A/value'])

    with h5py.File('outputs.mat', 'r') as f:
        B_ref = np.array(f['B/value'])

    # Call the function.
    B = my_complex_fun(A)

    # Check shapes are good.
    assert A.shape == B.shape

    # Check values are similar.
    np.testing.assert_all_close(B, B_ref)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Run the tests.
    _run_tests()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tests are inside the &lt;code&gt;_run_tests()&lt;/code&gt; function. This way, the module namespace will not be polluted with variables that could have the same name as other variables inside of a function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the code is run, the tests should raise errors if the output is not as expected, which will stop execution. You will see a big old error on the command line, and then you know that you must correct the code. You can raise an error by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; statement. It raises an error whenever the statement is False.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the methods in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.testing.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;np.testing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These methods can check whether, for example, the elements of numpy array are all close to a reference (within numeric error).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;raise&lt;/code&gt; statement to manually raise an error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s really all you need to test code. &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/python-testing/&quot;&gt;Numerous unit-testing libraries in Python exist&lt;/a&gt;, but at their core is the same idea: create code that raises an error when the output not what is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Picking organization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main effects are much easier to test than side effects in the unit-testing framework. You’ll often find yourself writing side-effect-free, modular and functional code for this reason. That’s great! You’ll tend to create smaller functions so that you can test each individual component. Your code will be easier to reason about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Python code you write may be objected-oriented. Although Matlab now has excellent support for classes, much Matlab code, especially older code, eschews the use of classes. If you don’t feel comfortable writing object-oriented code, don’t sweat it – Python code doesn’t have to use classes to be Pythonic. Classes make sense when something needs to remember and manage its own state. &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/&quot;&gt;Here’s a tutorial on Python classes if it’s something that intrigues you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Writing the code – common gotchas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve picked our tests, and picked how we’ll organize our code, we can start coding. Matlab’s matrix operations naturally translate to Numpy. Be careful with these common gotchas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reshape operations will cause you headaches. Matlab uses Fortran order, Python uses C by default. This means in Matlab:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-matlab&quot;&gt;A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]
A(:)

ans = 
    [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas in Python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(A.ravel())
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saving to hdf5 in Matlab and loading in Python will invert axes because of the distinction between C and Fortran order. You will have to swap axes front to back, for example. For example, if you save a three-dimensional tensor in Matlab &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and then load it back in Python via hdf5, you will need to call &lt;code&gt;A.swapaxes((2, 1, 0))&lt;/code&gt; to get back the original tensor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be careful with dimension-one vectors! If you have a one-dimension vector &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; of shape &lt;code&gt;(N, )&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;a.dot(a.T)&lt;/code&gt; gives you a vector of the shape &lt;code&gt;(N, )&lt;/code&gt;. It will not be a scalar, nor a matrix. If you wanted to computed the outer product of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; with itself, use &lt;code&gt;a.reshape((-1, 1)).dot(a.reshape((1, -1)))&lt;/code&gt; or better yet &lt;code&gt;np.outer(a, a)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hidden dot products can cause problems! The &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; operator applies to scalars and to vectors in Matlab, and the semantics are different depending on the dimension of the operands. &lt;code&gt;A.dot(B)&lt;/code&gt; replace Matlab’s &lt;code&gt;A * B&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/&quot;&gt;You may also see &lt;code&gt;A @ B&lt;/code&gt; being used but it’s still rather esoteric&lt;/a&gt;. * Objects in Python have pass-by-reference semantics. Several methods in numpy modify data in place. Be careful! Sometimes, you will explicitly need to &lt;code&gt;copy()&lt;/code&gt; your data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python uses 0-based indices and Matlab 1-based indices. Watch out!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at your data! Don’t fly blind!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you write a piece of code that you suspect may cause a bug, you can use inline &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; statements to make sure it works. I like to use this to check the dimensions of intermediate arrays, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the problems of direct index manipulation can go away by using &lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt; dataframes where appropriate. &lt;a href=&quot;http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;xarray&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; uses named dimensions for tensors, which can help avoid many mistakes caused by the need for swapping axes and reshaping. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;np.einsum&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can express complicated sums and products of tensors in an easy-to-read, less error-prone manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might want to consider translating parts of your numerics to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org/&quot;&gt;PyTorch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/&quot;&gt;Tensorflow&lt;/a&gt; directly, especially if you want to take advantage of automatic differentiation. Performance-sensitive code can be JIT’ed using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/jax&quot;&gt;jax&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://numba.pydata.org/&quot;&gt;numba&lt;/a&gt;, or rewritten in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cython.org/&quot;&gt;Cython&lt;/a&gt;. Start small and optimize as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using the method on a real script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/blob/master/original_force_external_feedback_loop.m&quot;&gt;The example script I rewrote is about 165 lines of code&lt;/a&gt;. It’s written in a pedagogic style and intersperses explanations, logic and plotting. In that sense, it’s similar to a jupyter notebook. I focused on transferring the logic of the main loop, which does a forward simulation of the network and trains it with the FORCE algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to change a handful of things related to plotting to get it to run in Octave, but I was able to get it to run within about 10 minutes. Not bad for 10-year code! The code is organized in this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sets up variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;runs the body of the computation (a big &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop). This body has side effects (plotting).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finishes in an end state that contains the results of the computation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the code is not set up as a function, it was fairly easy to isolate the inputs are – they’re what the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop needs to get started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;x0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;z0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ft&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the outputs are the variables computed in the main for loop, namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;zt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;w0_len&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I captured these inputs and outputs as a test case for my script. I commented out the forward simulation of the trained network that comes after the main for loop since it’s another logically separate component of the code that I could attack later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the end-to-end result of the script, I captured the result of the first iteration of forwarding the network state, to create a more granular test. I also checked array dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to write the code as a class, with methods &lt;code&gt;train&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;simulate&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/blob/master/chaotic_rnn.py&quot;&gt;The resulting code doesn’t look like Matlab code&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, because I’d set up a test scaffold, I could be assured that it works the same as the old Matlab code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation was hard! I ran into multiple very subtle issues translating the rather short code I was working (maybe 20 lines of real logic). The issues were subtle – incorrect manipulation of dimension-1 vectors, off-by-1 errors in a loop. Having reference code and functional tests allowed me to isolate these issues, fix them, and replicate the original functionality exactly. It took about 3 hours, which is a lot! I was very careful to set up a well-defined goalpost when I translated the code, so I knew when I would be done, which kept me going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/blob/master/chaotic_rnn.py&quot;&gt;The translated code is available here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/blob/master/Use%20chaotic%20RNN.ipynb&quot;&gt;I imported the code into a notebook and generated some figures from it&lt;/a&gt; – it runs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using test-driven development, it’s possible to systematically, incrementally transfer legacy Matlab code to the Python environment. You can be assured that the code will &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; in the end because you will have defined what &lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt; means. You will have created a test suite for your code with good coverage for your new Python code. You might even have spotted subtle bugs in the original Matlab code along the way! Future you will thank you for your attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 Elisabetta Ciani uses mouse models to help children with neurological genetic disorders. Problem is: her own lab members reported Ciani for data manipulation.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">
 &lt;p&gt;In January 2020, we quietly launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://status.arxiv.org&quot;&gt;status.arxiv.org&lt;/a&gt; — a landing page for arXiv’s operational status. After several weeks of trials, the status page is ready to be shared with the arXiv community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll use &lt;a href=&quot;https://status.arxiv.org&quot;&gt;status.arxiv.org&lt;/a&gt; to announce scheduled maintenance, unscheduled downtime, performance glitches, and other events that might affect your experience interacting with arXiv. If you’re interested in receiving these announcements as they happen you also have the option of subscribing to &lt;a href=&quot;https://subscribe.sorryapp.com/24846f03/email/new&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://subscribe.sorryapp.com/24846f03/slack/new&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; notifications. Most of our announcements will also be &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/arxiv&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. All of these links can also be found in our website footer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing a high level of service continues to be a primary goal, but we recognize that “stuff happens” and this tool will help us better communicate with you when it does. Thank you for your continued support of arXiv.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
