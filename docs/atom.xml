 Arbitrary and unfair behavior by scientific journals risks damaging the public's perception of science.

Two weeks ago, the Journal of Translational Science published a paper that reported a correlation between vaccination and autism in 666 children. On Monday, the paper disappeared from their website, with no explanation or retraction notice. Google's cache still has the paper here. Retraction Watch has more details.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you say it’s gonna happen now&lt;br /&gt;
When exactly do you mean?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask a psychologist the answer to this question – posed in this case by Morrissey in &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Smiths&lt;/i&gt; song, &lt;i&gt;How soon is now&lt;/i&gt;? – and she might reply “within the next three seconds”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that “now”, also known as the “subjective present”, is constrained within this time limit has proved popular&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; But a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-14703-001/&quot;&gt;new evaluation&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychological Bulletin&lt;/i&gt; of dozens of research papers on everything from embraces and reading poetry to tapping along to a beat concludes that there’s no good evidence for it. Our experience of the present cannot, it seems, be so strictly defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23769&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of events that we perceive as happening at the same time actually don’t quite co-occur, of course. An intriguing illustration of this comes, for example, from the neurological patient known in the literature as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945213000890&quot;&gt;PH&lt;/a&gt;. This man hears people’s voices before he registers the movement of their lips. At first, he thought the TV wasn’t correctly dubbed, but then he realised the same thing was happening with people he was talking to. Evaluation of his case led the researchers involved to conclude that there are various clocks in the brain, and PH has developed problems with the coordination of those linked to vision and hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there’s only about a 200-millisecond time difference between our brain’s processing of the sight of someone’s lips moving and the sound of their voice. So how big can a discrepancy get for a healthy brain not only to cease perceiving events as simultaneous, but to stop binding perceptions together into “the present”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his new critique of the three-second theory, Peter White at Cardiff University first considers evidence put forward from experiments into duration perception: if someone sounds a tone for two seconds, say, or eight seconds, how good is somebody else at holding down a button for the same length of time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernst Pöppel at the Ludwig-Maximillian University of Munich, Germany, has claimed that at about three seconds or under, we’re accurate, but beyond that, we under-estimate durations – which, he’s argued, supports the idea of two different brain processing modes: one for events that last less than three seconds, and one for events that take longer. This supports the idea that “now” lasts up to three seconds, he argues. In fact, a clear-cut boundary between performance below or over three-second durations does not exist, argues White. Rather, it seems that as the duration of a tone gradually gets longer, our performance tends to gradually worsen, too, and there’s no clear evidence of a shift in accuracy at the three-second mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about work investigating how well we can tap along to a beat? While some studies support the idea that we’re relatively accurate when the beat intervals are less than three seconds (which, again, Pöppel argues, suggests that we automatically process and integrate events that take three seconds or less as chunks of “now”), others just don’t, White points out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pöppel, and a surprising number of others, have also argued that human behaviours are structured in roughly three-second units. Wiping or rubbing something, pouring liquid from one pot to another, or reading a line of poetry, for example have been claimed to take approximately three seconds. Again, this is taken as evidence that our brains deal in three-second windows of time, with anything that happens within that time frame being viewed as a single event. (An &lt;a href=&quot;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10164-010-0260-y&quot;&gt;analysis of footage&lt;/a&gt; of athletes and coaches embracing at the Beijing Olympics even found that embraces tended to last an average of 3.17 seconds.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a significant methodological problem with at least some of the research, agues White: “How is a behavioural unit identified?” White cites research finding that when lay volunteers are shown videos or animations of human behaviour – such as an actor using a keyboard or chasing someone – and are asked to break these behaviours down into the smallest units that seem natural, their segments generally last a lot longer than three seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, White argues, while the idea of a three second subjective present is “simple and eye-catching, which probably contributes to its popularity”, it’s not accurate. There is, instead, he argues, an “envelope of integration” – a flexible period of time in which the brain incorporates data into an overall representation “that has no fixed time limit, but in any case extends well beyond the three second mark.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-14703-001/&quot;&gt;The Three-Second “Subjective Present”: A Critical Review and a New Proposal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="fr-FR">
 &lt;p&gt;Submitting papers to preprint servers (&lt;a href=&quot;http://biorxiv.org/&quot;&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;) is finally getting popular in biology. Unfortunately, many of these papers are formatted in a way that is very inconvenient to read, possibly because authors stick to the format asked by journals. Here are 10 simple rules to format your preprints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Format your preprint in the way you would like to read it. The next rules simply implement this first rule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use single spacing. No one is going to write between the lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert figures and their captions in the text, at the relevant place. It is really annoying when you have to continuously go back and forth between the text and the last pages. Putting figures at the end of the paper and captions yet at another place should be punished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t forget the supplementary material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don’t really need 10 rules. In fact the first rule is just fine.&lt;/li&gt;

 Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has enormous potential to provide improved cellular models of human disease. However, variable genetic and phenotypic characterisation of many existing iPSC lines limits their potential use for research and therapy. Here, we describe the systematic generation, genotyping and phenotyping of 711 iPSC lines derived from 301 healthy individuals by the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Initiative (HipSci: http://www.hipsci.org). Our study outlines the major sources of genetic and phenotypic variation in iPSCs and establishes their suitability as models of complex human traits and cancer. Through genome-wide profiling we find that 5-46% of the variation in different iPSC phenotypes, including differentiation capacity and cellular morphology, arises from differences between individuals. Additionally, we assess the phenotypic consequences of rare, genomic copy number mutations that are repeatedly observed in iPSC reprogramming and present a comprehensive map of common regulatory variants affecting the transcriptome of human pluripotent cells.

 &lt;p&gt;
 High-resolution serial-section electron microscopy (ssEM) makes it possible to investigate the dense meshwork of axons, dendrites, and synapses that form neuronal circuits. However, the imaging scale required to comprehensively reconstruct these structures is more than ten orders of magnitude smaller than the spatial extents occupied by networks of interconnected neurons, some of which span nearly the entire brain. Difficulties in generating and handling data for large volumes at nanoscale resolution have thus restricted vertebrate studies to fragments of circuits. These efforts were recently transformed by advances in computing, sample handling, and imaging techniques, but high-resolution examination of entire brains remains a challenge. Here, we present ssEM data for the complete brain of a larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) at 5.5 days post-fertilization. Our approach utilizes multiple rounds of targeted imaging at different scales to reduce acquisition time and data management requirements. The resulting dataset can be analysed to reconstruct neuronal processes, permitting us to survey all myelinated axons (the projectome). These reconstructions enable precise investigations of neuronal morphology, which reveal remarkable bilateral symmetry in myelinated reticulospinal and lateral line afferent axons. We further set the stage for whole-brain structure–function comparisons by co-registering functional reference atlases and in vivo two-photon fluorescence microscopy data from the same specimen. All obtained images and reconstructions are provided as an open-access resource.

            signalling</title>
		<link href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/N_vRyW5PwlM/nature22344"/>

 &lt;p&gt;
             The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) has a key role in the integration of
                various physiological stimuli to regulate several cell growth and metabolic
                    pathways. mTOR primarily functions as a catalytic subunit in two
                structurally related but functionally distinct multi-component kinase complexes,
                mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 (refs 1, 2). Dysregulation of mTOR signalling is associated with a
                variety of human diseases, including metabolic disorders and cancer.
                Thus, both mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activity is tightly controlled in cells. mTORC1
                is activated by both nutrients and growth factors, whereas mTORC2 responds primarily to extracellular cues such as
                growth-factor-triggered activation of PI3K signalling.
                Although both mTOR and GβL (also known as MLST8) assemble into mTORC1
                and mTORC2 (refs 11, 12,
                    13, 14, 15), it remains largely unclear what drives the dynamic
                assembly of these two functionally distinct complexes. Here we show, in humans
                and mice, that the K63-linked polyubiquitination status of GβL dictates
                the homeostasis of mTORC2 formation and activation. Mechanistically, the TRAF2 E3
                ubiquitin ligase promotes K63-linked polyubiquitination of GβL, which
                disrupts its interaction with the unique mTORC2 component SIN1 (refs 12, 13, 14) to favour mTORC1 formation. By contrast, the OTUD7B
                deubiquitinase removes polyubiquitin chains from GβL to promote
                GβL interaction with SIN1, facilitating mTORC2 formation in response to
                various growth signals. Moreover, loss of critical ubiquitination residues in
                GβL, by either K305R/K313R mutations or a melanoma-associated
                GβL(ΔW297) truncation, leads to elevated mTORC2 formation,
                which facilitates tumorigenesis, in part by activating AKT oncogenic signalling. In
                support of a physiologically pivotal role for OTUD7B in the activation of mTORC2/AKT
                signalling, genetic deletion of Otud7b in mice suppresses Akt activation and
                    Kras-driven lung tumorigenesis in vivo. Collectively, our study
                reveals a GβL-ubiquitination-dependent switch that fine-tunes the
                dynamic organization and activation of the mTORC2 kinase under both physiological
                and pathological conditions.

 The Jovian moon Io hosts the most powerful persistently active volcano in the Solar System, Loki Patera. The interior of this volcanic, caldera-like feature is composed of a warm, dark floor covering 21,500 square kilometres surrounding a much cooler central ‘island’. The temperature gradient seen across areas of the patera indicates a systematic resurfacing process, which has been seen to occur typically every one to three years since the 1980s. Analysis of past data has indicated that the resurfacing progressed around the patera in an anti-clockwise direction at a rate of one to two kilometres per day, and that it is caused either by episodic eruptions that emplace voluminous lava flows or by a cyclically overturning lava lake contained within the patera. However, spacecraft and telescope observations have been unable to map the emission from the entire patera floor at sufficient spatial resolution to establish the physical processes at play. Here we report temperature and lava cooling age maps of the entire patera floor at a spatial sampling of about two kilometres, derived from ground-based interferometric imaging of thermal emission from Loki Patera obtained on 8 March 2015 ut as the limb of Europa occulted Io. Our results indicate that Loki Patera is resurfaced by a multi-phase process in which two waves propagate and converge around the central island. The different velocities and start times of the waves indicate a non-uniformity in the lava gas content and/or crust bulk density across the patera.

             The heterogeneity of cellular states in cancer has been linked to drug resistance,
                cancer progression and the presence of cancer cells with properties of normal tissue
                stem cells. Secreted Wnt signals maintain stem cells in various
                epithelial tissues, including in lung development and regeneration. Here we show that mouse and human lung adenocarcinomas display
                hierarchical features with two distinct subpopulations, one with high Wnt signalling
                activity and another forming a niche that provides the Wnt ligand. The Wnt responder
                cells showed increased tumour propagation ability, suggesting that these cells have
                features of normal tissue stem cells. Genetic perturbation of Wnt production or
                signalling suppressed tumour progression. Small-molecule inhibitors targeting
                essential posttranslational modification of Wnt reduced tumour growth and markedly
                decreased the proliferative potential of lung cancer cells, leading to improved
                survival of tumour-bearing mice. These results indicate that strategies for
                disrupting pathways that maintain stem-like and niche cell phenotypes can translate
                into effective anti-cancer therapies.

 Animals partition their daily activity rhythms through their internal circadian clocks, which are synchronized by oscillating day–night cycles of light. The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster senses day–night cycles in part through rhodopsin-dependent light reception in the compound eye and photoreceptor cells in the Hofbauer–Buchner eyelet. A more noteworthy light entrainment pathway is mediated by central pacemaker neurons in the brain. The Drosophila circadian clock is extremely sensitive to light. However, the only known light sensor in pacemaker neurons, the flavoprotein cryptochrome (Cry), responds only to high levels of light in vitro. These observations indicate that there is an additional light-sensing pathway in fly pacemaker neurons. Here we describe a previously uncharacterized rhodopsin, Rh7, which contributes to circadian light entrainment by circadian pacemaker neurons in the brain. The pacemaker neurons respond to violet light, and this response depends on Rh7. Loss of either cry or rh7 caused minor defects in photoentrainment, whereas loss of both caused profound impairment. The circadian photoresponse to constant light was impaired in rh7 mutant flies, especially under dim light. The demonstration that Rh7 functions in circadian pacemaker neurons represents, to our knowledge, the first role for an opsin in the central brain.

 &lt;p&gt;
 The Notch signalling pathway mediates cell fate decisions and is tumour suppressive or oncogenic depending on the context. During lung development, Notch pathway activation inhibits the differentiation of precursor cells to a neuroendocrine fate. In small-cell lung cancer, an aggressive neuroendocrine lung cancer, loss-of-function mutations in NOTCH genes and the inhibitory effects of ectopic Notch activation indicate that Notch signalling is tumour suppressive. Here we show that Notch signalling can be both tumour suppressive and pro-tumorigenic in small-cell lung cancer. Endogenous activation of the Notch pathway results in a neuroendocrine to non-neuroendocrine fate switch in 10–50% of tumour cells in a mouse model of small-cell lung cancer and in human tumours. This switch is mediated in part by Rest (also known as Nrsf), a transcriptional repressor that inhibits neuroendocrine gene expression. Non-neuroendocrine Notch-active small-cell lung cancer cells are slow growing, consistent with a tumour-suppressive role for Notch, but these cells are also relatively chemoresistant and provide trophic support to neuroendocrine tumour cells, consistent with a pro-tumorigenic role. Importantly, Notch blockade in combination with chemotherapy suppresses tumour growth and delays relapse in pre-clinical models. Thus, small-cell lung cancer tumours generate their own microenvironment via activation of Notch signalling in a subset of tumour cells, and the presence of these cells may serve as a biomarker for the use of Notch pathway inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy in select patients with small-cell lung cancer.

 Most small molecules are unable to rapidly traverse the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and accumulate inside these cells, making the discovery of much-needed drugs against these pathogens challenging. Current understanding of the physicochemical properties that dictate small-molecule accumulation in Gram-negative bacteria is largely based on retrospective analyses of antibacterial agents, which suggest that polarity and molecular weight are key factors. Here we assess the ability of over 180 diverse compounds to accumulate in Escherichia coli. Computational analysis of the results reveals major differences from the retrospective studies, namely that the small molecules that are most likely to accumulate contain an amine, are amphiphilic and rigid, and have low globularity. These guidelines were then applied to convert deoxynybomycin, a natural product that is active only against Gram-positive organisms, into an antibiotic with activity against a diverse panel of multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. We anticipate that these findings will aid in the discovery and development of antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria.

             Nutrient signalling integrates and coordinates gene expression, metabolism and
                growth. However, its primary molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood in
                plants and animals. Here we report unique Ca2+ signalling triggered
                by nitrate with live imaging of an ultrasensitive biosensor in Arabidopsis
                leaves and roots. A nitrate-sensitized and targeted functional genomic screen
                identifies subgroup III Ca2+-sensor protein kinases (CPKs) as master
                regulators that orchestrate primary nitrate responses. A chemical switch with the
                engineered mutant CPK10(M141G) circumvents embryo lethality and enables conditional
                analyses of cpk10 cpk30 cpk32 triple mutants to define comprehensive
                nitrate-associated regulatory and developmental programs. Nitrate-coupled CPK
                signalling phosphorylates conserved NIN-LIKE PROTEIN (NLP) transcription factors to
                specify the reprogramming of gene sets for downstream transcription factors,
                transporters, nitrogen assimilation, carbon/nitrogen metabolism, redox, signalling,
                hormones and proliferation. Conditional cpk10 cpk30 cpk32 and nlp7
                mutants similarly impair nitrate-stimulated system-wide shoot growth and root
                establishment. The nutrient-coupled Ca2+ signalling network
                integrates transcriptome and cellular metabolism with shoot–root
                coordination and developmental plasticity in shaping organ biomass and
                architecture.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are a cause of stroke and seizure for which no effective medical therapies yet exist. CCMs arise from the loss of an adaptor complex that negatively regulates MEKK3–KLF2/4 signalling in brain endothelial cells, but upstream activators of this disease pathway have yet to be identified. Here we identify endothelial Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the gut microbiome as critical stimulants of CCM formation. Activation of TLR4 by Gram-negative bacteria or lipopolysaccharide accelerates CCM formation, and genetic or pharmacologic blockade of TLR4 signalling prevents CCM formation in mice. Polymorphisms that increase expression of the TLR4 gene or the gene encoding its co-receptor CD14 are associated with higher CCM lesion burden in humans. Germ-free mice are protected from CCM formation, and a single course of antibiotics permanently alters CCM susceptibility in mice. These studies identify unexpected roles for the microbiome and innate immune signalling in the pathogenesis of a cerebrovascular disease, as well as strategies for its treatment.

 The selective coupling of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to specific G proteins is critical to trigger the appropriate physiological response. However, the determinants of selective binding have remained elusive. Here we reveal the existence of a selectivity barcode (that is, patterns of amino acids) on each of the 16 human G proteins that is recognized by distinct regions on the approximately 800 human receptors. Although universally conserved positions in the barcode allow the receptors to bind and activate G proteins in a similar manner, different receptors recognize the unique positions of the G-protein barcode through distinct residues, like multiple keys (receptors) opening the same lock (G protein) using non-identical cuts. Considering the evolutionary history of GPCRs allows the identification of these selectivity-determining residues. These findings lay the foundation for understanding the molecular basis of coupling selectivity within individual receptors and G proteins.

		<id>http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/?p=19326</id>
		<updated>2017-05-09T22:36:29+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/05/Basket-and-Pyramidals-small-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;For most neuroscientists, long days in the lab pipetting or recording from cells doesn’t inspire one to pick up a paintbrush or sketchpad. But for others, the still-mysterious—and often breathtakingly beautiful—workings of the brain are a source of awe. One such individual is neuroscientist-turned-artist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gregadunn.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Greg Dunn&lt;/a&gt;. As a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, his own research merged with experimental forays into painting, adapting neural forms to the principles of Asian art. Greg joins us to discuss his personal journey to becoming a science artist, his visions for the burgeoning field of science-inspired art, and his advice for aspiring brain-loving artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You followed a unique career path compared to most scientists. Could you share a bit about your transition from scientist to artist and what inspired you to pursue this path?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GD&lt;/strong&gt;: I had always needed an artistic outlet in my life, and that became more true than ever when working on very complex biological systems in the lab. When experiments don’t work after a massive expenditure in your efforts, its nice to have something going in parallel that produces something tangible, such as art. I’ve always loved Asian art and the neuroscience images I saw every day in grad school began to merge with that interest, and over the course of several months in my first year of grad school I began to develop my aesthetic in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never felt that I was doing anything at the lab bench that others couldn’t have, but I do feel like I have a useful voice in combining science and art. I hope that my career trajectory serves as an example that specialized scientific knowledge can be applied to many different fields and can help to refine a person’s individual voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Art based on science (including neuroscience) is becoming increasingly popular. Why do you suspect this field is so appealing, even to non-scientists?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GD&lt;/strong&gt;: The brain is the ultimate frontier, it is more fundamentally US than anything else we possess. It is at the fundamental root of everything we could possibly be interested in or do with our lives. It is similar to why astronomy is popular to the lay public in this sense, it holds such great philosophical mysteries to explore. And on top of its conceptual and metaphorical meaning, it is aesthetically beautiful. It is so rich in possibility that it is the sort of thing a person can comfortably spend their whole life exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How, if at all, do you believe that neuroscience-inspired art can serve as an effective outreach tool? Have you witnessed this with your own work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GD&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes. Art harnesses the power of emotions and direct perceptions in a way that hard data and dry explanations can’t. I deliberately use the power of composition and design to try and make my works appealing on an instinctive level. With the world at our fingertips, people need to be given a reason to care about what they are looking at. Making compelling paintings is about drawing the viewer in initially and then giving them something to chew on in the long term, in this case pondering the nature of the brain and mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gregadunn.com/self-reflected/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Self Reflected&lt;/a&gt;, my latest work done in collaboration with Dr. Brian Edwards, the point was to demonstrate directly what complexity looks like. Telling somebody that the brain has 86 billion neurons is essentially meaningless because we have no ability to grasp what that number means. Showing somebody directly what the activity of 500,000 neurons looks like at once in a huge, wall sized microetching gives a person a stepping stone to begin to comprehend this astonishing fact. When you then tell them that the brain is actually hundreds of millions of times MORE complicated than that, that’s when a light goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_19336&quot; style=&quot;width: 512px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/05/Self-Reflected-in-violets.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-19336&quot; height=&quot;377&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/05/Self-Reflected-in-violets-1024x754.jpg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Self Reflected in Violets- the entire Self Reflected microetching under violet and white light– (photo by Greg Dunn and Will Drinker)&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you select the subject matter for your work? Do you have any favorite pieces that were particularly meaningful, or that you’re especially proud of?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GD&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m attracted by a variety of compelling images and subjects in neuroscience and meditation. I try to choose subjects that are of interest to different categories of people- some are more specialized neuro, others more general, some more abstract, etc. I’d say that some of my favorites are Basket and Pyramidals as I think it is a clear statement about how neurons fit in the fractal like organization of nature and how they are similar in form to trees, branches, etc that have been painted in gold leaf in Asia for centuries. Cortex in Metallic Pastels also turned out very well and is one of the first examples of my deep reflective gold leaf technique. And, of course, Self Reflected is the most ambitious project of any kind I’d ever attempted. Its scope and attention to detail I think will make it a useful visualization of the brain for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_19337&quot; style=&quot;width: 512px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/05/Cortex-in-Metallic-Pastels.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-19337&quot; height=&quot;254&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/05/Cortex-in-Metallic-Pastels-1024x509.jpg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Cortex in Metallic Pastels (21K gold, palladium, dye, ink, and metal powders on aluminized panel), 48” X 96”, 2012.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The overlapping fields of art and neuroscience are evolving rapidly. How to do you see the field changing over the next decade?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GD&lt;/strong&gt;: Representing brain aesthetics is only one part of it. There is a lot of art/sci work going on in using EEG signals or other neurofeedback devices to direct tasks of various sorts. I am looking forward to seeing some of the work that will come out of collecting unconscious brain activity data that will direct image generation software. I personally plan to try to elucidate states of consciousness that arise in deeper states of meditation through art, as this is more of a subjectively and experientially directed bit of neuroscience art. I think that it is important that art poke our brains into different types of perceptions to teach us a bit more about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any advice for others hoping to pursue a career in science-inspired art?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GD&lt;/strong&gt;: Find your own unique voice! Make a Venn diagram of what your passions are and think hard about how and where they intersect. That is where you will be more effective, motivated, and unique. Really strive to make something categorically new. Don’t always trust your first idea on how to do something, give yourself the time to really iterate an idea in your mind before you realize it. If you are trying to make a living at it, be smart about how to balance your passion with financial realities. Overall, work to convince the world that the barriers between science and art are indistinct at best, and that multifaceted approaches to problems are the most effective solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Predatory journals – which charge high fees and often offer little-to-no vetting of research quality – are a problem, and lately an easy target for authors eager to spoof the problems of the publishing system. Although many researchers try to steer clear, not all do – a recent paper showed that some top economists publish […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say that if you can laugh at it, you can live with it. Is this true? Does the ability to see the funny side of things really act like a psychological shield against stress? &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167217699583&quot;&gt;A series of new studies&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychological Bulletin&lt;/em&gt; provides some tentative support for the idea. But the research also illustrates why this is such a difficult topic to study – does humour really reduce stress or is it just easier to see the funny side when you are coping well? And it’s worth remembering the serious risk that if humour is shown to be protective by psychology research – and it’s a big &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; – that those who suffer most from stress will be put under social pressure to help themselves by cheering up, a situation only likely to intensify their distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23667&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heidi Fritz at Clarkson University and her colleagues began by conducting a diary study with 21 women and 1 man diagnosed with the chronic pain condition Fibromyalgia Syndrome. The participants first completed baseline questionnaires about their physical health, psychological state, their tendency to see the funny side of things (for example, they were asked whether they would typically experience mirth in situations such as a waiter spilling a drink over them), how much socialising and support they’d had with friends and relatives recently, and how much they tended to reappraise challenges, such as looking for the positives in a difficult situation. Then the participants spent the next four days completing diary entries several times each day about their physical and emotional state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more pronounced the participants’ sense of humour, the lower their psychological distress at the start of the study and the better their physical symptoms through the diary stage. But against the researchers’ expectations, the apparent benefits of humour weren’t explained by sense of humour being linked with a tendency to reappraise situations, nor to better social relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second study involved just over 100 undergrad students answering questions about their psychological and emotional state, their tendency to find things funny and make jokes, and they also recalled a previous distressing event and how much it continued to affect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the more that the students said the past trauma continued to affect them, the higher they scored for signs of psychological distress. But crucially this wasn’t the case for the students who were most inclined to humour and seeing the funny side of things – they said the trauma was still affecting their lives, but based on their emotional scores, they weren’t experiencing heightened distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious problem with these first two studies is that it might simply be that the less distressed participants were better able to experience humour, rather than their inclination for humour reducing their stress levels or, in the case of the first study, their physical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final study attempted to overcome this methodological problem and involved students affected by the September 11 terror attacks in New York.  The students completed baseline psychological measures one month after the attacks, including scoring their disposition for humour (and their humour style), and then two months later, they answered more questions about their levels of psychological distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said there was a tendency for self-enhancing humour (taking a cheerful perspective on life) to be associated with reduced stress over time – though direct evidence for this did not reach statistical significance in their analysis – and that this was related to a greater inclination to reappraise situations – finding the positives where possible. In contrast, self-defeating humour (disparaging oneself) was associated with more distress and less reappraisal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fritz and her colleagues said a consistent pattern had emerged from their studies: “positive humour use predicted reduced psychological distress in response to stressful events”. However, the evidence for this conclusion seems weak: only the final study had the longitudinal methodology needed to identify a potential causal role for humour in reducing distress, and in fact it failed, statistically, to establish that a stronger inclination for humour at baseline was directly associated with less distress at follow-up (and even if it had, it’s still possible that another unknown variable(s) – such as personality – was the true causal factor behind more humour and less distress. Stronger evidence for humour’s stress-busting benefit would require an experiment that manipulated people’s sense of humour and looked at the effects on stress – clearly a tricky thing to do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given the persistent lay belief in the physical health benefits of humour use, it is critical that we understand the magnitude of its effect,” the researchers concluded. Far more robust research is needed before we reach that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167217699583&quot;&gt;Humor Use Moderates the Relation of Stressful Life Events With Psychological Distress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 A new paper in the prestigious journal PNAS contains a rather glaring blooper.

The paper, from Oxford University researchers Eiluned Pearce et al., is about the relationship between genes and social behaviour. The blooper is right there in the abstract, which states that &quot;three neuropeptides (β-endorphin, oxytocin, and dopamine) play particularly important roles&quot; in human sociality. But dopamine is not a neuropeptide.

 &lt;p&gt;For the second time, a journal has quickly retracted a study that suggested vaccines raise the risk of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A class of drugs called protease inhibitors have been lifesaving for people with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, these medications come with a long list of side effects that may include impairments in cognitive function. How protease inhibitors might cause cognitive side effects has remained a mystery for some time. New research from the University of Pennsylvania is beginning to shed light on the answer, and it lies in a protein that is one of the main components of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protease inhibitors work to treat HIV by preventing replication of the HIV virus. The drugs block an enzyme called HIV protease, which cleaves the protein precursors required to produce new viral particles. Inhibiting HIV protease thus prevents the spread of the virus throughout the body. Since the approval of these drugs for clinical use in 1995, the rate of deaths from HIV has declined drastically. A typical HIV patient takes a combination of protease inhibitors and other medications to counter the development of drug-resistant HIV strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side effects caused by protease inhibitors are common. These include dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, metabolic syndrome, and, potentially, cognitive dysfunction. HIV-associated cognitive disorders, abbreviated HAND, include a spectrum of symptoms such as forgetfulness, confusion, and behavioral and motor changes. While the HIV virus itself is believed to play a role in causing HAND symptoms, the drugs used to treat the virus, including protease inhibitors, have also been implicated in the development of HAND. Until now, little was known about how protease inhibitors might cause cognitive side effects, and therefore, how such symptoms might be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent research from the University of Pennsylvania has shed new light on the mechanism by which protease inhibitors might impair cognitive function. Work by Kelly Jordan-Sciutto and colleagues in the Department of Pathology at the University of Pennsylvania has demonstrated that protease inhibitors increase levels of the peptide beta amyloid in the brain. Excessive levels of beta amyloid can impair the way brain cells function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beta amyloid protein is commonly known for playing a major role in Alzeheimer’s disease and several other neurological diseases, including Lewy body dementia, inclusion body myositis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. In Alzheimer’s disease, beta amyloid forms plaques or clumps of protein that give rise to deposits outside of brain cells, causing impairments in cell function. Increased levels of beta amyloid and its precursor protein – amyloid precursor protein (APP) – have also been observed in the brains of HIV-infected patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan-Sciutto’s team had previously found that HIV drugs such as protease inhibitors can be toxic to neurons. They showed that some of these toxic effects were caused by damage to the DNA of the cell’s energy-generating cells, called mitochondria, which are located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ER stress is known to activate the cell’s unfolded protein response (UPR) that increase the level of a protein called BACE1. In turn, BACE1 increases levels of beta amyloid by cleaving its precursor protein, APP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan-Sciutto theorized that because protease inhibitors cause ER stress, they might also increase beta amyloid by activating the UPR, and thus BACE1 and APP downstream. Their most recent study, published in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Pathology&lt;/em&gt;, explored these questions further by examining whether protease inhibitors change the levels of beta amyloid and other cellular proteins that regulate its production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore this question, a group of macaques were infected with the form of HIV found in monkeys, called simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Monkeys were then treated with either a cocktail of protease inhibitors or a placebo. The brains of the monkeys were examined 160 days following infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the experiments showed that SIV-infected monkeys treated with protease inhibitors had much higher levels of beta amyloid in their neurons than infected monkeys who did not receive the drug. Infected drug-treated monkeys also showed increased levels of the amyloid beta precursor protein. As Jordan-Sciutto predicted, these monkeys also had increased levels of BACE1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, 90% of the placebo-treated animals developed signs of neurological dysfunction by 12 weeks of treatment, whereas the animals treated with the drug cocktail did not display any of these symptoms. This raises the question of whether the observed increases in amyloid beta protein in the drug-treated animals are pathological; that is, whether this amount of beta amyloid can cause symptoms. To date, the researchers have not studied monkeys treated with protease inhibitors in the absence of SIV infection in order to assess the effects of the drug alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To partly address this problem, the researchers also studied the effect of protease inhibitors on the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cultured cells derived from rat glial cells and human fetal tissue. Protease inhibitors increased the expression of markers associated with UPR activation and increased BACE1 in the cultured cells, which led to an increase in the cleavage of APP and subsequent cell damage. Conversely, treatment with a drug that inhibited BACE1 prevented this cell damage. Finally, the researchers showed that another enzyme, called PERK, was also a key player in the unfolded protein response that led to the increase in BACE1 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These novel findings provide a clear mechanism for protease inhibitor brain toxicity in patients with HIV, suggesting that these drugs may in fact contribute to the development of HIV-associated cognitive disorders by increasing beta amyloid. Despite these neurotoxic effects, protease inhibitors will remain a mainstay for the treatment of HIV, as they have profoundly improved the quality of life and extended the lifespan of patients. The results of these studies suggest that potential new therapies targeting the proteins BACE1 and PERK could prevent the cognitive side effects of protease inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some common-sense reasons for thinking that being raised without siblings will have meaningful psychological consequences – after all, “only children” are likely to get more attention from their parents than kids with sibs, but at the same time they miss out on the social experience that comes from sharing, playing and competing with brothers or sisters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest study to look into this, &lt;a href=&quot;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11682-016-9530-9?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals&quot;&gt;published recently&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Brain Imaging and Behavior&lt;/em&gt;, comes from China where the government’s one-child family planning programme has led to a huge increase in the numbers of only children. Junyi Yang and his colleagues scanned the brains of hundreds university students, about half of whom were only children and also tested their personality, creativity and intelligence. The only children outperformed the participants with siblings on creativity, but they scored lower on trait agreeableness – psychological differences that appeared to coincide with relevant structural differences in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23583&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test of creativity – the verbal part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrance_Tests_of_Creative_Thinking&quot;&gt;the Torrance Test&lt;/a&gt; – was fairly comprehensive and involved the participants doing things like coming up with unusual uses for cardboard boxes, improving a toy elephant and thinking about the consequences of an imaginary scenario. Personality was assessed using a fairly standard self-report questionnaire. And the brain imaging scan was used to look for group differences in grey matter volume in specific brain areas that the researchers thought might be relevant based on past research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only children’s superior performance on the creativity tasks tied in with their having more grey matter, on average, in the supramarginal gyrus of their brains than the participants with siblings (even after factoring out group differences in family income and parents’ education). This is a region in the parietal lobe that Yang and his team said has previously linked with mental flexibility and imagination; also in this study, across all participants, grey matter volume in this brain region correlated with creativity scores. The researchers speculated only children’s apparent superior creativity may be related to the greater contact they’d had with their parents, and perhaps their parents’ having heightened expectations for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the only children also scored lower on agreeableness – a trait that’s associated with warmth and concern for others. This seemed to tie in with their having less grey matter in the medial prefrontal cortex (and across the sample, more grey matter here correlated with trait agreeability) – a region at the front of the brain that’s known to be involved in thinking about the self in relation to others. The researchers speculated this could be explained by only children receiving excessive attention and praise from parents and other family members, and having a lack of social practice with siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s always interesting when data comes in that speaks to some of our folk assumptions about human psychology – in this case, how the kind of upbringing we have shapes the kind of people we become. But it’s worth treating these new findings with some caution, especially given the recent, rigorous studies that have suggested birth order is not linked to personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the snapshot nature of the new findings, with measures only taken at one time point, and the lack of diversity in the current sample – highly educated young people in China – being an only child is also heavily confounded with other factors like parents’ social and educational background and genes inherited from parents (although the researchers made some effort to account for some of this). Also, it’s always risky trying to interpret the meaning of structural brain differences. Still, the new results give us something to work with and could help direct the course of future research on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

 A paper just published in Nature Human Behaviour makes some big claims about the brain. It's called Evidence for a large-scale brain system supporting allostasis and interoception in humans, but how much is evidence and how much is speculation?



The authors, Ian R. Kleckner and colleagues of Northeastern University, argue that a core function of the brain is allostasis, which they define as the process by which the brain &quot;efficiently maintains energy regulation in the body&quot;. Allostasis ent</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Professor Iain Buchan, the Farr Institute and Dame Nancy Rothwell, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Manchester&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/datasaveslives-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to ignore the proliferation of information technology in all aspects of everyday life with the healthcare environment being no exception. &lt;a href=&quot;http://informaticsforhealth.org/&quot;&gt;Informatics for Health 2017&lt;/a&gt; brought together leaders in the field performing cutting edge research into how we can use information technology in all kinds of healthcare settings as well as in medical research. One of the overarching messages was that the use and re-use of healthcare data could revolutionize the understanding of human health and disease with the phrase ‘data saves lives’ prominent throughout the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaining the public’s trust and developing the informatics workforce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the sessions were focused on the work that is being carried out in the UK, specifically the North of England, which has become a hub for informatics research with projects such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.connectedhealthcities.org/&quot;&gt;Connected Health Cities&lt;/a&gt; headed up by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/researchers/john-ainsworth(9ad38019-9856-4c5d-acea-2614976f8d74).html&quot;&gt;John Ainsworth&lt;/a&gt;. In a panel session, he described the main aims of the project which center on the use of information technology to improve health services for patients in Northern England. Another key aim of the project is to establish the public’s trust which will allow researchers to use their data. In his talk during one of the early panel sessions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/Buchan.html&quot;&gt;Iain Buchan&lt;/a&gt; also highlighted the importance of obtaining trust from participants. Such trust is often won by demonstrating how the results of the research will be of benefit to the patient population, and as such tends to be easier to obtain from a smaller community of patients who will be able to see the direct benefit of the research to their community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of sessions and talks also highlighted the importance of the workforce, made up of those working in both discovery science and the healthcare setting. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/person/dr-martin-bardsley&quot;&gt;Martin Bardsley&lt;/a&gt; spoke about the need to ensure that we have enough informatics experts and analysts who can handle and analyze healthcare data. Once the research is being put into practice it’s also imperative that the workforce on the front-line of healthcare is on-board with the implementation of the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The use of informatics in healthcare: from patients to research and back again&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recurring theme at the conference centered around a circular model that has been proposed in a recent article in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/23/4/791/2198415/An-informatics-research-agenda-to-support&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which summarizes how informatics can and should be used in medicine. The model puts the patient at the start and the end of the circle; with data collected during their care being used in research leading to the generation of new knowledge which is then fed back into the system leading to changes in healthcare policy, thereby improving the care that the patient experiences. In the first of the plenary talks, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.labmedinfo.org/people/bellazzi&quot;&gt;Riccardo Bellazi&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Pavia, discussed one of the key considerations in this circle; the variety observed in biomedical big data and how this can be harnessed in translational and clinical research as well as in the care of patients. This large variety comes from the sheer quantity of data that is now being collected and methods are required to deal with data on this scale at every stage, including data storage, integration and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8941&quot; style=&quot;width: 1390px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Riccardo Bellazi, University of Pavia&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8941&quot; height=&quot;1136&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/RB2-e1493973390887.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1380&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Riccardo Bellazi, University of Pavia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another of the plenary talks, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.vu.nl/~frank.van.harmelen/&quot;&gt;Frank van Harmelen&lt;/a&gt; of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam spoke about how linked data can improve healthcare systems. There has been steady progress in the linking of data-sets on the web to create data networks that contain billions of facts and rules that can be used to find information very quickly. Despite these advances, such systems are not so common in the healthcare setting. Professor van Harmelen presented some ways that these data networks could be used in healthcare, for example in the organization of data on FDA approved drugs including side effects and adverse reactions. From his presentation, it’s clear that there is some way to go before these ideas can be harnessed fully in the healthcare setting and there is real scope for improvement in the flow and organization of health information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of the keynote talks was given by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucl.ac.uk/health-psychology/people/Susan_Michie&quot;&gt;Susan Michie&lt;/a&gt; of University College London who presented her work on the Human Behavior-Change Project, which aims to develop methods for systematically analysing human behavior and how this can affect health. This project is an example of the potential power of information technology in medical research as it will build an Artificial Intelligence system to analyze the global literature and extract information on human behavior in order to generate evidence that will then inform researchers, policy makers and clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8943&quot; style=&quot;width: 3357px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Susan Michie, University College London talks about the Human Behavior-Change Project&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8943&quot; height=&quot;2615&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/SM2-e1493973513521.jpg&quot; width=&quot;3347&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Susan Michie, University College London talks about the Human Behavior-Change Project&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final keynote speaker, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patientslikeme.com/members/view/18944&quot;&gt;Sally Okun&lt;/a&gt;, rounded off the conference with a talk focusing on health technology from the patient perspective. She is Vice President for Advocacy, Policy and Patient Safety at PatientsLikeMe, an online patient centered research network. The network currently has around half a million users and stores information on each individual in a similar way to an electronic health record. One of the future aims of the network is to provide a ‘digital avatar’ for each patient which can be used for decision making, for example for selecting treatment options, by considering all of the information that is stored on that person. It was fitting to end the conference with a talk focusing on how patients can directly benefit from the use of information technology, which is the ultimate driving force for the research being carried out in the medical informatics field.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Presenting a simulation in a visualization lab&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/SpencerFox-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring rains and rising temperatures came early this year, signaling the start of mosquito season and the threat of new Zika outbreaks in the United States. Imagine that you are a public health official in Houston, Texas. You know that parts of the city may be vulnerable to Zika spread and that at least 81 people have arrived in the metropolitan area infected with Zika since 2015. The challenge is that most Zika infections are asymptomatic and therefore not diagnosed by doctors or reported to public health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although most Zika cases are quite mild, a Zika outbreak is cause for serious concern and immediate intervention because of the established link between Zika infection during pregnancy and neurological complications in unborn babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zika could spread &lt;em&gt;silently&lt;/em&gt; in Houston long before it’s detected. Although most Zika cases are quite mild, a Zika outbreak is cause for serious concern and immediate intervention because of the established link between Zika infection during pregnancy and neurological complications in unborn babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You receive notification that a single individual with no travel history to Zika affected regions has tested positive for Zika, signaling that local transmission has occurred. Should you initiate costly interventions, including mosquito control and educational campaigns, or wait for more cases to arise? How would a second case change your decision? Would your response be different if you were a public health official in Lubbock, Texas instead of Houston? Depending on your location, the presence of two cases can reflect an anomalous low probability event or indicate an imminent or ongoing outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our recent article: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2394-9&quot;&gt;Assessing real-time Zika risk in the United States&lt;/a&gt;”, we present a computational model intended to help public health officials navigate such challenges and assess epidemic risks as cases accumulate within their jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our model considers the two prerequisites for a Zika outbreak: the arrival of infected travelers and the prevalence of &lt;em&gt;Aedes &lt;/em&gt;mosquito species capable of transmitting disease to uninfected people. If infected travelers are the “sparks”, then mosquito bites provide the fuel for a full-blown outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Texas as a high risk case study, we find that the Zika importation rate can be predicted from local tourism spending, and that mosquito-borne transmission depends on climatic and socioeconomic conditions, with the highest risks occurring in low GDP, high temperature regions.  By simulating these processes, in conjunction with the unpredictable nature of disease transmission and Zika’s low reporting rate, we found that the 254 counties of Texas vary enormously in risk. Most counties have almost no chance of a Zika outbreak while a few high risk counties have 60-fold greater risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when and where should public health officials trigger interventions? In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) prudently recommended a two case threshold and Texas Department of State and Health Services (DSHS) conservatively opted to reduce the threshold to a single reported locally-transmitted case of Zika. Indeed, during the small November 2017 Zika outbreak in Cameron County, Texas DSHS intervened immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our model is designed to help officials determine appropriate intervention triggers, depending on local environmental and socioeconomic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our model is designed to help officials determine appropriate intervention triggers, depending on local environmental and socioeconomic conditions. High risk regions, like the Houston Metropolitan region and Rio Grande Valley should certainly have early (one or two case) triggers.  However, given economic and societal costs of Zika intervention, lower risk regions like the Dallas or Austin metropolitan areas might consider less stringent thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we enter mosquito season in the Southern US, this model can be used readily for public health planning and real-time risk assessments. Zika prevalence across the Americas is considerably lower today than this time last year; during the first 15 weeks of 2016, the weekly prevalence peaked around 40,000 cases per week compared to less than 2,000 cases per week this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has translated into fewer infected travelers arriving in Texas, down from 33 by May of 2016, to only 11 as of May in 2017.   Thus, as we optimistically look towards a mosquito season with fewer Zika ‘sparks’, this framework can provide data-driven insight for anticipating and managing risk in vulnerable regions of the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ginnysmithscience.com/&quot;&gt;Ginny Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty years ago, in Connecticut, a series of infamous experiments were taking place. The volunteers believed they were involved in an investigation into learning and memory, and that they would be administering shocks to a test subject whenever he answered questions incorrectly. But despite pretences, the scientist behind the research, Stanley Milgram, wasn’t actually interested in learning. The real topic of study? Obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milgram recorded how far his participants were willing to go when told to deliver larger and larger shocks. In one version of the study, 26 out of 40 participants continued to the highest shock level – two steps beyond the button labelled “Danger: severe shock”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this was 50 years ago – surely the same wouldn’t happen if the experiment were conducted today? That’s what a group of researchers from SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Poland aimed to find out, in a “partial replication” of Milgram &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550617693060&quot;&gt;published recently&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23551&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s ethical guidelines meant Dariusz Doliński and his colleagues couldn’t recreate Milgram’s experiment completely. However, they took advantage of the fact that in the original experiments, the 10th shock level seemed especially important, a kind of “point of no return”. The overwhelming majority of the participants who went this far continued to the end of the experiment, administering the 30th and final shock level, which they thought was lethal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Doliński and his team used just 10 shock levels, to speed things up and reduce the stress of the task on their 80 participants (aged 18 to 69; attempts were made to exclude those likely to be familiar with the original Milgram research). The researchers assumed that the portion of participants who agreed to administer this 10th shock (labelled 450 volts) would give a good assessment of the proportion who would have been prepared to go all the way in the original version of the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Milgram, and other replication attempts in the US and elsewhere, the team found the majority (90 per cent in this case) of “teachers” were willing to continue to the highest shock level, even after hearing screams of pain from the “learner”. The researchers also went a step further, attempting to find out whether the sex of the “learner” had any effect on the “teacher’s” behaviour. However because so few “teachers” refused to continue to the end, there was too small a sample size to see if disobedience was higher when the ‘learner’ was male or female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does this tell us? First, it suggests that despite the so-called replication crisis currently gripping psychology, there are still some classic findings that are reliable, albeit that there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/13/social-psychology-textbooks-ignore-all-modern-criticisms-of-milgrams-obedience-experiments/&quot;&gt;fierce debate&lt;/a&gt; over how to interpret participants’ behaviour and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/02/16/milgrams-obedience-studies-not-about-obedience-after-all/&quot;&gt;whether it truly reflects obedience or not&lt;/a&gt;. Second, it highlights the fact that obedience – if that is what’s on display – is common across cultures. Poland, and other Eastern European countries around it, have experienced huge political changes over the last 80 years, with heavily controlled communism giving way to democratic freedoms. Now, the pendulum is starting to swing again, with the socially conservative “Law and Justice” party winning the 2015 Polish elections and remaining hugely popular. But despite all these changes, and the issues that have come with them, the instinct to submit to authority still seems to be strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550617693060&quot;&gt;Would You Deliver an Electric Shock in 2015? Obedience in the Experimental Paradigm Developed by Stanley Milgram in the 50 Years Following the Original Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychologists studying how our expectations change over time have observed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22985178&quot;&gt;our hopes tend to dip the nearer we get to receiving some feedback&lt;/a&gt;, be that an exam result, sports score or health test outcome. They call this “bracing” and there’s evidence we do it more in some situations than others, for example the more severe the potential outcome and the more personally relevant, the more we brace. But do some of us brace more than others, and specifically, do optimists brace as much as pessimists? According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12289/full&quot;&gt;a series of nine studies&lt;/a&gt; published recently in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality&lt;/em&gt;, the answer is yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23486&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Kate Sweeny’s and Angelica Falkenstein’s studies involved tests for signs of bracing and tests of either dispositional optimism (measured by agreement with statements like “In uncertain times, I usually expect the best”) and/or pessimism (measured by agreement with statements like “I spend lots of time imagining what could go wrong”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the most compelling studies involved law students, who were asked to predict their performance on an upcoming bar exam, and then to predict their results one month and one day before the results were due in. Other studies involved psychology undergrads who were asked to forecast how well they thought they’d done on an intelligence test, a maths test, or how attractive they would be rated by other students. Crucially, sometimes they were asked to make these predictions knowing that their actual performance or attractiveness feedback would be given to them imminently (a set-up designed to induce bracing), while other times they were told their results would never be made available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the studies, even though optimists had higher expectations overall, they showed just as much bracing as pessimists. It remains to be seen whether these results will generalise to non-student samples. And there must be doubts over the realism of the studies that compared students’ predictions in a no-feedback versus imminent feedback context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Sweeny and Falkenstein said it makes sense that bracing seems to be such a common strategy, even among optimists. Although optimism as an enduring trait has known benefits for our health and wellbeing – for instance, optimists tend to be happier and enjoy better health – Sweeny and Falkenstein pointed out that “well-timed pessimism” is also advantageous:  “after all, if people expect the worst, they can hardly be unpleasantly surprised and it causes little or no distress if embraced only in the final moments before feedback.” They added, “pessimism at the moment of truth also minimizes the likelihood of looking foolish if things do not turn out as hoped, particularly if people express their newfound pessimism to others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say there ares no differences between individuals in their tendency to brace. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232471180_Abandoning_Unrealistic_Optimism_Performance_Estimates_and_the_Temporal_Proximity_of_Self-Relevant_Feedback&quot;&gt;prior work&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that people with higher self-esteem are less likely to brace, perhaps because they are less worried about looking foolish when outcomes don’t match their expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12289/full&quot;&gt;Even Optimists Get the Blues: Interindividual Consistency in the Tendency to Brace for the Worst&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the 1960s, Nobel-prize winning research shook our understanding of what it means to be a conscious entity. Epilepsy patients who’d had the thick bundle of nerves connecting their two brain hemispheres either severed or removed (as a drastic treatment for their epilepsy) responded in laboratory tasks as if they had two separate minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an unsettling idea that has appeared in psychology textbooks for decades. But dig into the original studies and you’ll find the evidence for split brains leading to split minds was mostly descriptive. Now a team of researchers led by Yair Pinto at the University of Amsterdam has conducted systematic testing of two split-brain patients over several years, specifically to find out whether the division of their brains has also separated their consciousness. In fact, the results, &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/140/5/1231/2951052/Split-brain-divided-perception-but-undivided?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;published recently&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Brain&lt;/em&gt;, suggest their consciousness remains unified. It may be time to rewrite the textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23371&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the original observations and the new results, it helps to revisit a little basic neurobiology. There’s a lot of cross-wiring in the brain (the formal term is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decussation&quot;&gt;decussation&lt;/a&gt;), which means that the left side of space is processed by the brain’s right hemisphere and the right side of space is processed by the left hemisphere, which in most people is also the hemisphere that controls speech. Similarly, the left arm is controlled by the right hemisphere, and the right arm by the left hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a healthy person, the two hemispheres communicate extensively across a thick bundle of neurons called the corpus callosum (there are other lesser connections) meaning information from either side of space is shared and available to your unified consciousness. Consequently, if your right hemisphere sees something in the left side of space, your left hemisphere (controlling speech) can still name it or point to it with your right arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in split brain patients with a severed or removed corpus callosum, the original reports suggested that they were unable to verbally describe anything appearing on the left side of space, nor could their right hand point to it, or point to a picture matching it, even though their right hemisphere knew what was there (it could use the left hand to point to the target or to a picture that matched it). It’s as if the patients had two separate minds: one half knew what was on one side of space even while the other half was ignorant. It wasn’t only their brains that were split, their consciousness was too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roger Sperry, the scientist who won the Nobel prize for this work, hinted that there were exceptions to this split-mind phenomenon, but before now no one seems to have tested the idea systematically. For the new research, Pinto and his colleagues conducted five thorough experiments with two split-brain patients. Each experiment was really a variation on the same theme. Either verbally or by pointing, the patient had to assess the position of, or identify, pictures or shapes that appeared on one side or other of a computer screen, or they had to compare shapes or pictures on either side of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patients were impaired: they were unable to make comparisons between shapes or pictures that appeared simultaneously on either side of space. And when identifying or localising a picture or shape on just one side of space, their accuracy varied depending on which side of the screen it appeared on – suggesting the two sides were processed separately at a perceptual level. But here’s the critical finding: regardless of whether the target shapes or pictures were located on the left or right side of space, the patients were able to report on them by any modality – by speech, with their right hand or left hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, despite their brain hemispheres being largely separated, information processed by one side or other did at some stage become available at a unified conscious level, which the patients could report on verbally or act on with either arm. Pinto and his colleagues pointed out that not only does this contradict established textbook accounts of split-brain patients, but also raises problems for contemporary theories of consciousness, such as the Global Workspace theory, which is predicated on the idea that information reaches consciousness when it is broadcast across the brain hemispheres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tests were conducted many years after the patients underwent their radical brain surgery so it remains possible that the original split minds phenomenon is real, but only transient. If so, the compensatory mechanisms that overcome the phenomenon remain unknown. Changes to neurosurgical practices mean that split-brain patients are rare today and few of those tested in the original research are still alive. This means time is running out to explore these fascinating questions further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have shown that severing the cortical connections between the two brain hemispheres does not seem to lead to two independent conscious agents within one brain,” the researchers said. “This raises the intriguing possibility that even without massive communication between the cerebral hemispheres, and thus increases in modularity, unity in consciousness and responding is largely preserved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/140/5/1231/2951052/Split-brain-divided-perception-but-undivided?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;Split brain: divided perception but undivided consciousness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This statistic becomes more troubling when we consider a significant number of individuals likely do not seek medical services. TBIs are clearly a public health concern and have captured the attention of the public, media, sports community, and medical healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8934&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;public domain&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8934&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Emergency-300x169.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;public domain&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary to this attention, an increasing amount of literature examining the lingering effects of previous concussion(s) now exists; however, this literature frequently demonstrates mixed results. Unfortunately, the existing research also frequently contains insufficient sample sizes, lack of stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria, absence of case matching, and/or mixing of sexes in the groups examined. In our recent study, we attempted to address these limitations by utilizing a large sample database of over 26,000 athletes aged 10 to 19 years, extensive inclusion and exclusion criteria, and a case match design. Participants were grouped according to sex and number of previous self-reported concussions and then case matched on age, sex, and body mass index (BMI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one-way analysis of variance was used to examine overall differences between concussion groups on symptoms reported and scores obtained on the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT ®) neurocognitive battery composites. A between-subjects main effect was not found for any of the neurocognitive profiles (e.g., verbal memory, visual memory, and reaction time) for males or females; however, results demonstrated male participants reported significantly increased symptoms of dizziness, fogginess, concentration difficulties, and memory problems as the number of self-reported previous concussions increased. A similar trend was not found for female participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8935&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Erik Drost Flickr&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8935&quot; height=&quot;254&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Erik-Drost-Flickr-300x254.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Erik Drost, Flickr&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, our finding that male adolescents with a self-reported history of concussions are suffering from greater daily discomfort than their non-concussed peers is a cause for concern. While it is not clear why a similar trend was not observed in females, several possible explanations exist, including: male athletes are known to underreport symptoms and are less likely to be diagnosed with a concussion unless relatively severe or higher number of symptoms are present; males endorsing more symptoms may also be more likely to connect their experiences to a higher number of past concussions; males are more likely to engage in sports associated with increased violent and aggressive acts (e.g., football and wrestling); and previous research suggesting estrogen and progesterone are neuroprotective and may aid in recovery post-concussion (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7925843&quot;&gt;Roof, Duvdevani, Braswell, &amp;amp; Stein, 1994&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16222128&quot;&gt;Stein &amp;amp; Hoffman, 2003&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, our findings appear to contradict a significant portion of the existing literature that did not utilize stringent inclusion and exclusionary criteria, had insufficient sample sizes, and mixed sexes in the groups examined. Consequently, it becomes more likely that these studies’ findings may at least be partially explained by confounding variables (e.g., differences among males and female participants as well as psychiatric diagnoses affecting symptoms reported and neurocognitive performance). Due to the role confounding factors may be playing in the existing research’s results, we recommend use of caution when interpreting and generalizing research that utilizes a relatively lenient inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., mixing of sexes and not screening for learning disorder diagnoses and ADHD) and insufficient sample sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our results do not indicate lasting neurocognitive changes following concussion, it is important to note &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14754723&quot;&gt;the ImPACT® may lack the necessary sensitivity and specificity to measure chronic changes in cognition&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, it is also important to note that the information we analyzed was obtained by self-report. As a result, our study does not allow for an inference of causation between concussion history and persistent neurocognitive impairment or post-concussive symptoms. Despite this, our results did provide evidence of persistent negative subjective effects that correlate with number of self-reported concussions, suggesting future research in this area is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 The lipid bilayer has so far eluded visualization by conventional crystallographic methods, severely limiting our understanding of phospholipid– and protein–phospholipid interactions. Here we describe electron density maps for crystals of Ca2+-ATPase in four different states obtained by X-ray solvent contrast modulation. These maps resolve the entire first layer of phospholipids surrounding the transmembrane helices, although less than half of them are hydrogen-bonded to protein residues. Phospholipids follow the movements of associated residues, causing local distortions and changes in thickness of the bilayer. Unexpectedly, the entire protein tilts during the reaction cycle, governed primarily by a belt of Trp residues, to minimize energy costs accompanying the large perpendicular movements of the transmembrane helices. A class of Arg residues extend their side chains through the cytoplasm to exploit phospholipids as anchors for conformational switching. Thus, phospholipid–Arg/Lys and phospholipid–Trp interactions have distinct functional roles in the dynamics of ion pumps and, presumably, membrane proteins in general.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Susceptibility and protection against human autoimmune diseases, including type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and Goodpasture disease, is associated with particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. However, the mechanisms underpinning such HLA-mediated effects on self-tolerance remain unclear. Here we investigate the molecular mechanism of Goodpasture disease, an HLA-linked autoimmune renal disorder characterized by an immunodominant CD4+ T-cell self-epitope derived from the α3 chain of type IV collagen (α3135–145). While HLA-DR15 confers a markedly increased disease risk, the protective HLA-DR1 allele is dominantly protective in trans with HLA-DR15 (ref. 2). We show that autoreactive α3135–145-specific T cells expand in patients with Goodpasture disease and, in α3135–145-immunized HLA-DR15 transgenic mice, α3135–145-specific T cells infiltrate the kidney and mice develop Goodpasture disease. HLA-DR15 and HLA-DR1 exhibit distinct peptide repertoires and binding preferences and present the α3135–145 epitope in different binding registers. HLA-DR15-α3135–145 tetramer+ T cells in HLA-DR15 transgenic mice exhibit a conventional T-cell phenotype (Tconv) that secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, HLA-DR1-α3135–145 tetramer+ T cells in HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR15/DR1 transgenic mice are predominantly CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) expressing tolerogenic cytokines. HLA-DR1-induced Treg cells confer resistance to disease in HLA-DR15/DR1 transgenic mice. HLA-DR15+ and HLA-DR1+ healthy human donors display altered α3135–145-specific T-cell antigen receptor usage, HLA-DR15-α3135–145 tetramer+ Foxp3− Tconv and HLA-DR1-α3135–145 tetramer+ Foxp3+CD25hiCD127lo Treg dominant phenotypes. Moreover, patients with Goodpasture disease display a clonally expanded α3135–145-specific CD4+ T-cell repertoire. Accordingly, we provide a mechanistic basis for the dominantly protective effect of HLA in autoimmune disease, whereby HLA polymorphism shapes the relative abundance of self-epitope specific Treg cells that leads to protection or causation of autoimmunity.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Mediator is a multiprotein co-activator that binds the transcription pre-initiation complex (PIC) and regulates RNA polymerase (Pol) II. The Mediator head and middle modules form the essential core Mediator (cMed), whereas the tail and kinase modules play regulatory roles. The architecture of Mediator and its position on the PIC are known, but atomic details are limited to Mediator subcomplexes. Here we report the crystal structure of the 15-subunit cMed from Schizosaccharomyces pombe at 3.4 Å resolution. The structure shows an unaltered head module, and reveals the intricate middle module, which we show is globally required for transcription. Sites of known Mediator mutations cluster at the interface between the head and middle modules, and in terminal regions of the head subunits Med6 (ref. 16) and Med17 (ref. 17) that tether the middle module. The structure led to a model for Saccharomyces cerevisiae cMed that could be combined with the 3.6 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of the core PIC (cPIC). The resulting atomic model of the cPIC–cMed complex informs on interactions of the submodules forming the middle module, called beam, knob, plank, connector, and hook. The hook is flexibly linked to Mediator by a conserved hinge and contacts the transcription initiation factor IIH (TFIIH) kinase that phosphorylates the carboxy (C)-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II and was recently positioned on the PIC. The hook also contains residues that crosslink to the CTD and reside in a previously described cradle. These results provide a framework for understanding Mediator function, including its role in stimulating CTD phosphorylation by TFIIH.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Persistent neural activity maintains information that connects past and future events. Models of persistent activity often invoke reverberations within local cortical circuits, but long-range circuits could also contribute. Neurons in the mouse anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) have been shown to have selective persistent activity that instructs future actions. The ALM is connected bidirectionally with parts of the thalamus, including the ventral medial and ventral anterior–lateral nuclei. We recorded spikes from the ALM and thalamus during tactile discrimination with a delayed directional response. Here we show that, similar to ALM neurons, thalamic neurons exhibited selective persistent delay activity that predicted movement direction. Unilateral photoinhibition of delay activity in the ALM or thalamus produced contralesional neglect. Photoinhibition of the thalamus caused a short-latency and near-complete collapse of ALM activity. Similarly, photoinhibition of the ALM diminished thalamic activity. Our results show that the thalamus is a circuit hub in motor preparation and suggest that persistent activity requires reciprocal excitation across multiple brain areas.
