&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychiatrie.charite.de/fileadmin/user_upload/microsites/m_cc15/psychiatrie/Mitarbeiter/cvs/Hasselmann/CV_Hasselmann.pdf&quot;&gt;Helge Hasselmann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive performance fluctuates throughout the day. Depending on their “chronotype” some people are sharpest in the morning (“larks”), while others generally prefer the later hours of the day (“owls”). For obvious reasons, this is mirrored in our preferred sleep routines: larks get tired in the evenings earlier and, as a consequence, also wake up earlier, while owls show the opposite pattern. Your chronotype is not something that you’re stuck with for the rest of your life, but it changes with age. In fact we’re most likely to show an owl-like chronotype during adolescence, which might at least partly explain why teenagers often stay up late and arrive at school with eyes bloodshot thanks to a hefty sleep debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if late chronotypes are so common in adolescents, why does school start so early (usually well before 9am in the UK, Netherlands and Germany)? Doesn’t that mean that many students are likely to be constantly sleep-deprived and not assessed during their biological peaks? Yes, it does! In fact, there is a lot of evidence to suggest that school kids who have a late chronotype score lower grades. But besides reduced sleep time, there are several alternative explanations for why a late chronotype could be associated with lower academic performance (such as absenteeism, for instance) as explored in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-04076-y&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports. &lt;/i&gt;The researchers, led by Giulia Zerbini at University of Groningen, say their findings might help us understand the chronotype/school grade link and how we can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-26902&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers collected more than 40,000 individual exam grades across multiple school subjects from 523 pupils (aged 11 to 17) at various Dutch secondary schools. They also assessed the chronotype of the students with the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ) which asked them several questions about their sleep habits, including what time they went to bed, fell asleep and woke on school days compared with the weekend. These data also made it possible to calculate social jetlag, which is a rough measure of the misalignment between biological and social clocks. For example, imagine you are generally not sleepy until midnight but that you have a job that means you have to be in the office from 7am: you are likely to be at risk of developing social jetlag because it will be difficult for you to get enough sleep to fit in with your schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So did owls in this study get lower grades? Yes, they did. In fact, the negative association between having a late chronotype and poorer school performance was similar to the association between absenteeism from school and poorer grades! For every hour a student’s chronotype ran later, grades dropped by 0.06 (on the 0-10 Dutch grading scale). Interestingly, this effect was largely independent of sleep duration, suggesting that even when owls got enough sleep, they still performed poorly compared with larks, perhaps because of their difficulty performing at their best during certain school hours. Consistent with this, they actually achieved similar grades to larks when they took the exam in the afternoon, nearer to their own optimal time of day. A similar pattern was also seen for the association between later chronotype and having an increased risk of dismissal from class, late arrival and social jetlag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An even more interesting pattern emerged when the researchers looked at school subjects separately. A later chronotype was associated with poorer performance in science (except physics), but not in humanities/linguistic subjects (in contrast, absenteeism had universally negative associations with grades). The apparently subject-specific relevance of chronotype chimes with previous studies suggesting that chronotype and time-of-day variation in performance have the most pronounced effects in areas demanding fluid intelligence, such as mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings should give policy makers food for thought. For example, they reiterate the common observation that adolescents often have late chronotypes and that early school schedules do not match their needs. And it’s not simply their fault for not going to bed early enough – often, their circadian rhythm is to blame just as much! It is promising that some British schools have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10818678/School-introduces-no-mornings-policy-for-tired-teenagers.html&quot;&gt;begun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/8579951.stm&quot;&gt;trialling&lt;/a&gt; later start times. Even if there is no room for modification in terms of school times, at least it could be a good idea for schools to consider postponing science subjects and exams until after lunch. Of course, this won’t transform every pupil into a potential Oxbridge graduate. But, at least it might make some of them feel less tired and help them perform at their best.&lt;/p&gt;

A “self” with the capacity for autobiographical memory and complex thought? Traditionally, the field of cognitive science has been concerned with explaining the mind in isolation from the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The growing field of &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;embodied cognition&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, seeks to rejoin them. One major strand has focused on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17705682&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;grounded cognition&quot;&gt;grounding&lt;/a&gt; higher-order semantics and language understanding in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11301525&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;perceptual symbol systems&quot;&gt;perceptual&lt;/a&gt; and sensory-motor representations. This view is distinct from theories of knowledge based on abstract, amodal representations divorced from sensory-motor experience. Another wing of the embodied approach is concerned with how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v3/n8/full/nrn894.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interoception&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot; data-hveid=&quot;55&quot; data-ved=&quot;0ahUKEwj9kbT6po7VAhWHxlQKHaTPB_IQ4EUINzAB&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; the inner sense of your physical state &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot; data-hveid=&quot;55&quot; data-ved=&quot;0ahUKEwj9kbT6po7VAhWHxlQKHaTPB_IQ4EUINzAB&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; grounds your feelings and emotions in the body. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v7/n2/full/nn1176.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Interoceptive awareness&lt;/a&gt; of visceral functions such as heartbeat has been related to core consciousness and awareness of self, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763416308053&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;body image&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A relatively neglected yet critical aspect of any grand theory of the embodied self is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Vestibular_system&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vestibular system&lt;/a&gt;. The vestibular system is the set of sensory organs responsible for maintaining our balance and keeping our visual field in a stable position while our head moves around. These organs are located in the inner ear and include...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;...two &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolith&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;otolith&lt;/a&gt; organs (the saccule and utricle), which sense linear  acceleration (i.e., gravity and translational movements), and the three  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicircular_canal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;semicircular canals&lt;/a&gt;, which sense angular acceleration in three planes.  The receptor cells of the otoliths and semicircular canals send signals  through the vestibular nerve fibers to the neural structures that control eye movements, posture, and balance. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quote above is from &lt;span class=&quot;subpages&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Vestibular_system&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kathleen Cullen and Soroush Sadeghi (2008)&lt;/a&gt;, who have an excellent review on the vestibular system in &lt;i&gt;Scholarpedia&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eZcwRdUD2yM/WWu9q3u5zOI/AAAAAAAAMNc/z5YPAp30J_EoGY5wBApacvm9hZ8bg5p7wCLcBGAs/s1600/Vestibular_system.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;904&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1056&quot; height=&quot;341&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eZcwRdUD2yM/WWu9q3u5zOI/AAAAAAAAMNc/z5YPAp30J_EoGY5wBApacvm9hZ8bg5p7wCLcBGAs/s400/Vestibular_system.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We take the vestibular system for granted until something goes wrong, like motion sickness (a mismatch of movement perceived by the vestibular and visual systems) or a rare disorder of the inner ear such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9ni%C3%A8re%27s_disease&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;'characterized by episodes of feeling like the world is spinning (vertigo), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), hearing loss, and a fullness in the ear'&quot;&gt;Menière’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. But how can a dysfunction of the inner ear influence our sense of self?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/77/6/760.short&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Song, Jáuregui-Renaud, and colleagues (2008)&lt;/a&gt; looked at symptoms of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;depersonalization&lt;/a&gt; (a feeling of detachment from oneself) in 50 patients with peripheral vestibular disease and 121 healthy controls. The participants were given the Depersonalization/Derealization Inventory of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12112722&quot;&gt;Cox and Swinson (2002)&lt;/a&gt; to assess symptoms of &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20140313163001/http://www.dissociative-identity-disorder.net/wiki/Depersonalization_Disorder&quot; title=&quot;Depersonalization Disorder&quot;&gt;these conditions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Depersonalization: Experiences of unreality, &lt;span class=&quot;tooltip &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tooltip_abbr&quot;&gt;detachment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,   or being an outside observer with respect to one's thoughts, feelings,   sensations, body, or actions (e.g.,perceptual alterations, distorted   sense of time, unreal or absent self, emotional and/or physical   numbing.)&quot;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tooltip &quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tooltip_abbr&quot;&gt;Derealization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:   &quot;Experiences of unreality or detachment with respect to surroundings   (e.g., individuals or objects are experienced as unreal, dreamlike,   foggy, lifeless, or visually distorted.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the expected high frequency of dizziness, the patients were much more likely to experience feelings of Shifting Ground, Spaced Out, Body Feels Strange, and Not Being in Control of Self than were controls (see bottom half of the figure below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cp_SGt4B6cc/WWvHMd2nQBI/AAAAAAAAMNk/uNxxYGdhtFQPZiWFkClmAuIQ7Z9SBYdGACLcBGAs/s1600/Fig%2B1_DD%2BSymptoms.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;683&quot; data-original-width=&quot;864&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cp_SGt4B6cc/WWvHMd2nQBI/AAAAAAAAMNk/uNxxYGdhtFQPZiWFkClmAuIQ7Z9SBYdGACLcBGAs/s400/Fig%2B1_DD%2BSymptoms.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The authors suggest that abnormal vestibular signals disrupt the relationship of the self to the environment, leading to strange feelings of detachment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Vestibular disease causes primary symptoms of vertigo and feelings that the ground is unstable ... which are more marked in distinct, acute episodes. These immediate symptoms are, by definition, unreal experiences since the body is not spinning and the ground is not heaving, but they are readily understandable as perceptions derived directly from abnormal sensory signals. Vestibular dysfunction could also compromise more general precepts of stable relationships between the self and the environment...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Symptoms of depersonalization/derealization can be induced experimentally in healthy people via &lt;a href=&quot;https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003429.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;caloric stimulation&lt;/a&gt;. This procedure is used medically to check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17314478&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vestibulo-ocular reflex&lt;/a&gt;, which stabilizes the visual image while the head is moving. The test involves delivering warm or cold water into the ear canal and observing the resultant eye movements (or lack thereof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/77/6/760.short&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Song et al. (2008)&lt;/a&gt; administered caloric stimulation to 20 of their vestibular patients and 20 controls. After stimulation, many healthy participants reported feelings of detachment/separation from their surroundings (40%), and that their body feels strange/different (50%). These were novel experiences for most. Conversely, the patients reported no such changes after stimulation because they already experience these symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An even more extreme way to stimulate the vestibular system is through &lt;a href=&quot;http://naukarus.com/reliability-of-utricular-function-testing-using-a-sinusoidal-translation-profile-during-unilateral-centrifugation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;unilateral centrifugation &lt;/a&gt;(i.e., spinning around in a specialized chair).

The target of this test differs from the caloric procedure, which stimulates the semicircular canals. The utricles and the semicircular canals detect different types of motion (linear  acceleration and angular acceleration, respectively), and the authors wanted to see if unilateral centrifugation would produce the same effects as caloric stimulation. And indeed, after centrifugation, symptoms of depersonalization and derealization were reported with increased frequency &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot; data-hveid=&quot;55&quot; data-ved=&quot;0ahUKEwj9kbT6po7VAhWHxlQKHaTPB_IQ4EUINzAB&quot;&gt;— &lt;/span&gt;e.g., Surroundings seem strange and unreal; Time seems to pass very slowly; Body feels strange or different in some way (see Table below for details).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;- click on image for a larger view -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-05-S4Df7hmY/WMszCpXNXaI/AAAAAAAAMFI/uXB0Y-qy-5UaI_oFX16cFzqUCCSMWaO7QCLcB/s1600/Depersonalization_derealization%2Bsymptoms.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-05-S4Df7hmY/WMszCpXNXaI/AAAAAAAAMFI/uXB0Y-qy-5UaI_oFX16cFzqUCCSMWaO7QCLcB/s400/Depersonalization_derealization%2Bsymptoms.png&quot; width=&quot;343&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;modified from Table 2 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-vestibular-research/ves597&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aranda-Moreno &amp;amp; Jáuregui-Renaud, 2016&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; Frequency (Freq) and severity (score range) for each of the symptoms of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12112722&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cox and Swinson (2002)&lt;/a&gt; depersonalization/derealization inventory reported by 100 subjects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These results provide further evidence that the vestibular system contributes to the construction of the self. The sense of inhabiting one's body is assembled from many different inputs, of course. These &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165017305000792&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;can go awry&lt;/a&gt; in epilepsy, migraine, focal brain injury, psychiatric disturbances, and under extreme stress. Although rare, out-of-body experiences are more frequent in persons who suffer from dizziness due to vestibular disorders (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945217301892&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lopez &amp;amp; Elzière, 2017&lt;/a&gt;).

 It appears that memes and science don't mix well. A pair of researchers have published an apology in a peer-reviewed journal - for using the word &quot;derpy&quot; in an earlier paper.



In April 2016, Archives of Sexual Behavior published a piece called Fighting the Derpy Science of Sexuality by Banu Subramaniam and Angela Willey.



In this paper, Subramaniam and Willey criticized studies of biological differences between human groups:

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Concussion is the most common form of traumatic brain injury. While serious concussions present with overt symptoms, the diagnosis of mild concussions remains a clinical difficulty. Researchers recently developed two novel methods for the diagnosis of concussion that may aid in the identification of less severe traumatic brain injuries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/06/new-game-like-technology-helps-assess-concussions/&quot;&gt;concussion&lt;/a&gt; is a relatively common traumatic brain injury caused by a fall or blow to the head that results in a temporary impairment of brain function. Loss of consciousness is common, but contrary to popular belief, it is not a requirement for diagnosis. Typical indicators include drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, headache, and memory impairment, among other neurological symptoms. These symptoms usually persist for a few months, but some patients continue to experience cognitive and behavioral manifestations long after the initial injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detection of concussion using objective, quantitative methods remains a clinical challenge. Traditional &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/16/looking-inside-our-heads-brain-imaging-and-patient-adherence/&quot;&gt;brain imaging techniques&lt;/a&gt;, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, are not sensitive enough for this application. Therefore, diagnosis is usually made using non-objective methods such as patient interviews and self-assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of researchers led by Margot Taylor at Simon Fraser University have developed a n&lt;a href=&quot;http://10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004914&quot;&gt;ew method&lt;/a&gt; for detecting mild traumatic brain injuries using magnetoencephalographic (MEG) imaging. The results were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt;. Taylor and colleagues are members of the Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience Institute and the ImageTech Lab at SFU, home to the only research-dedicated MEG scanners in western Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEG imaging is a technique that measures the magnetic fields generated by brain activity. It has excellent spatial and temporal resolution and can identify events with millimeter and millisecond precision. MEG imaging can be used to map the interaction among various brain areas. Importantly for clinical applications, MEG imaging is completely noninvasive, and can be used in both adults and children without harmful radiation exposure, or the need to inject isotopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mild traumatic brain injury is associated with damage to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/03/14/shifting-paradigms-of-white-matter-diseases/&quot;&gt;white matter&lt;/a&gt; of the brain, made up of bundles of nerve axons that connect one brain area to another. When two brain areas are connected, they show activity pattern synchronization, referred to as oscillatory network synchrony. The researchers hypothesized that by using MEG imaging to measure network synchrony, they could identify small disruptions in the connections between brain areas that result from traumatic brain injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEG scans were performed on patients who were diagnosed with a mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in the prior three months, and on healthy controls. Computer analyses were performed to calculate several indices of network connectivity, and significant differences were found between patients and controls. The differences were stronger when less time had elapsed between the injury and the imaging procedure. Overall, MEG imaging was able to detect the presence of a mild concussion with 88% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another &lt;a href=&quot;http://10.1038/srep39009&quot;&gt;10.1038/srep39009″&amp;gt;groundbreaking study&lt;/a&gt;, a group of researchers led by Nina Kraus and Cynthia LaBella of the Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory at Northwestern University have developed an approach for diagnosing concussion using an auditory biomarker. Their work was recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The processing of sound by the brain is a complex process that involves interaction among the cognitive, sensory, and limbic systems. Damage to any of these brain systems should therefore interrupt &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2009/09/22/hearing-voices-underpinnings-of-auditory-hallucinations/&quot;&gt;auditory processing&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers proposed. The question Kraus and colleagues asked was whether concussion-induced changes in sound processing would be large enough to distinguish between patients with a concussion and controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this question, the researchers measured speech-evoked frequency-following responses (FFRs) in 40 children with and without a concussion. The FFR is generated by the auditory center of the brain, and it incorporates cognitive, sensory, and reward input. Changes in the FFR have previously been associated with other clinical syndromes. Importantly, the FFR can be easily measured by placing electrodes on the scalp and delivering a sound stimulus into the ear. The FFR measurement is highly reliable and is consistent across the lifespan within an individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children who had sustained concussion were tested an average of 27 days after their injury. Neurophysiological responses were measured in terms of the magnitude, timing, accuracy, and pitch processing of the fundamental frequency of speech (F0). Children with &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/05/14/jury-still-out-on-after-effects-of-concussion/&quot;&gt;concussion&lt;/a&gt; exhibited on average a 35% smaller response to the F0 than the controls. They also showed impaired pitch coding, and smaller and slower brain responses to speech. These measures were correlated with the number of concussion symptoms reported by the patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers created a statistical model incorporating these data. Their model was able to classify subjects into concussion or control groups with 90% sensitivity and 95% specificity, suggesting that the observed changes in auditory processing are an accurate biomarker of concussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers cite the portability, reliability, and accuracy of their test as major advantages for its clinical application in diagnosing new injuries. Baseline readings could be made in athletes who participate in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/03/08/sports-concussion-new-testing-methods-are-imperative/&quot;&gt;impact sports&lt;/a&gt;, and repeat measures could be taken at the end of the season or following an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with MEG imaging, this method provides an objective and quantitative means for diagnosing brain dysfunction after mild traumatic brain injury. These methods will be useful both for identifying patients with mild injuries, and for developing guidelines for recovery and the return to work and play following an injury.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Population aging is bringing about a substantial increase in the prevalence of neurocognitive disorders. Current projections estimate that, by 2050, more that 130 million people will be affected by dementia worldwide. As experts assemble to devise strategies to face this incoming challenge, one conclusion stands out: prevention is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of prevention is obvious: to promote good health and take action before disease onset, thereby reducing the incidence of disease. And this is obviously better than having to manage a disease and its complications, and losing &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/09/04/pursuing-happiness-doesnt-have-to-promote-depression-in-others/&quot;&gt;quality of life&lt;/a&gt; – “prevention is better than cure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in order for preventive behaviors to be acquired, knowledge is essential – knowledge of modifiable risk factors and preemptive actions that can be adopted, and knowledge of how effective they really are. Studies addressing the benefit of lifestyle interventions for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2009/06/12/nsaids-prevention-or-just-delay-of-dementia/&quot;&gt;prevention of dementia&lt;/a&gt; have identified numerous modifiable risk and protective factors and have shown that change can indeed be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modifiable risk factors for cognitive impairment include lifestyle factors such as smoking, high alcohol intake, diet (saturated fats, sugar, processed foods), and poor physical activity; these then manifest in other risk factors that are already a consequence of inadequate lifestyle options, namely vascular and metabolic diseases (cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, overweight and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/28/effect-of-obesity-on-human-brain/&quot;&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, high cholesterol). In the end, it all builds up to speed up cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protective factors include opposite lifestyle choices, such as quitting smoking, moderate alcohol intake, healthier diet (&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2013/08/04/the-health-benefits-of-a-mediterranean-diet/&quot;&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, polyunsaturated fatty acids and fish-related fats, vitamins B6 and B12, folate, antioxidant vitamins (A, C and E), vitamin D, physical activity, and mentally stimulating activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, cognitive disorders are complex, multifactorial conditions – even if you lead the healthiest life, dementia may still strike you. But this should not be an excuse to let go because research shows is that preventive behaviors shift the odds in your favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of behavioral change is that it should be integrative. Single-domain interventions provide some benefit: physical activity and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/04/15/brain-training-can-we-really-enhance-our-cognitive-skills/&quot;&gt;cognitive training &lt;/a&gt;have been positively associated with cognitive performance in multiple studies; also, a recent meta-analysis showed that an increased consumption of fruit and vegetables reduces the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. But multi-domain interventions, in which multiple risk factors are targeted simultaneously are more likely to deliver better results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a 2015 Finnish study assessed the effect of a 2-year multimodal intervention in adults aged 60-77 years at risk of cognitive decline but without pronounced cognitive impairment. Four intervention targets were included: diet, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/19/high-intensity-interval-training-and-brain-health/&quot;&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;, cognitive training, and vascular risk. The program’s design included a diet with high consumption of fruit and vegetables, consumption of wholegrain cereal products and low-fat milk and meat products, low sucrose intake, use of vegetable margarine and rapeseed oil instead of butter, and fish consumption at least two portions per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical exercise training program included progressive muscle strength training, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/03/11/exercise-boosts-brain-power/&quot;&gt;aerobic exercise&lt;/a&gt;, and exercises to improve postural balance. Cognitive training consisted of computer-based training targeting executive processes, working memory, episodic memory, and mental speed. Metabolic and vascular risk factors were monitored throughout the study. Social activities were also stimulated through the numerous group meetings of all intervention components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study showed that simultaneous changes in multiple risk factors, even of small magnitude, had beneficial effects on the risk of cognitive decline, on overall cognition, complex memory tasks, executive functioning and processing speed, and on also BMI, dietary habits, and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a timely prevention seems fundamental – these lifestyle interventions may not be as effective once cognitive impairment is manifest. A recent study evaluated the impact of a 3-year &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/16/nurturing-the-brain-part-7-omega-3-fatty-acids/&quot;&gt;omega-3 fatty acid&lt;/a&gt; supplementation with or without multi-domain lifestyle interventions on cognitive function in adults aged 70 years or older. These adults already had symptoms of cognitive impairment: either memory complaints, limitations in one instrumental daily living activity, or slow gait speed. The multi-domain intervention included cognitive training, physical activity, nutrition, and management of cardiovascular risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, neither the omega-3 supplementation alone, nor the combination with the lifestyle interventions were able to reduce cognitive decline. Also, the adherence to lifestyle interventions over time was lower in this study when compared to other studies with younger seniors, with no clinical manifestations of dementia onset. But still, those with increased risk of dementia were the ones who benefited the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early prevention is probably the best strategy. Instead of trying to prevent dementia later in life, focusing on preventing earlier, milder, and more common forms of cognitive impairment may be a better strategy that may end up also preventing cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and, ultimately, dementia. Because they’re all fruits from the same tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I confess, I’ve tried having an alcoholic drink before giving a public speech, telling myself that it will take the edge off my nerves. But I’m going to think twice before doing so again: a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796717300864&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Behaviour Research and Therapy&lt;/em&gt; carefully monitored the effects of moderate alcohol intake on the speech-giving performance of socially anxious and control participants and while the alcohol made the nervous folk feel more relaxed, it actually harmed their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-26806&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan Stevens and his colleagues recruited 99 young adults who met the criteria for social anxiety disorder and 78 non-anxious controls, and then allocated them randomly to one of three conditions: an alcohol group drank three vodka orange juices with the strength adjusted to their body weight to ensure they reached a blood alcohol concentration of 0.07 per cent (for comparison, the drink drive limit in England and Wales and Northern Ireland is 0.08, ditto for the USA, while it’s 0.05 in Scotland); a placebo group who thought the orange juice they were drinking had vodka in it; and a baseline group who knew they were drinking pure orange juice. The participants reported how anxious they were feeling before, during and after delivering a three-minute speech on the death penalty in front of an audience of two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The socially anxious participants who drank alcohol felt less nervous during the speech and afterwards, as compared with anxious participants in the placebo group and in the baseline pure-orange group. This gives an indication of why alcohol can become a crutch for so many anxious people with rates of problem drinking being much higher than average among people with anxiety diagnoses. Looking on the bright side, given that excessive anxiety can hamper performance, you’d think the calming effects of the alcohol might have aided the performance of the socially anxious participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not what the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drinking alcohol actually led to socially anxious participants’ speeches being rated worse by two scorers who didn’t know which participants had a social anxiety diagnosis, nor who had drunk alcohol. The scorers also gave poor ratings to the speeches given by non-anxious control participants who’d drunk alcohol (for this group, there was no calming effect of alcohol, perhaps because they didn’t find the speech particularly nerve-wracking anyway). These findings suggest that even a couple of drinks is intoxicating enough to interfere with the mental processes needed to deliver an effective speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the socially anxious participants in the placebo condition, they felt less nervous than the baseline group who knew they’d drunk pure orange juice, but more nervous than alcohol group, suggesting that the calming effects of alcohol are partly pharmacological and partly to do with expectations. Participants in the placebo condition also gave worse speeches than those in the baseline condition, but not as poor as those in the alcohol condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stevens and his colleagues said the performance-harming effect of alcohol could lead to a vicious circle: anxious people drink alcohol to calm their nerves, but it interferes with their speech-giving performance, so they get more negative feedback than they would have done sober, and then they’re even more nervous about the next time they have to give a speech, which only makes them want to drink again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that alcohol might have different effects on the social performance of anxious participants in different kinds of contexts, such as chatting at a party or at a meal.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/07/Affective-disorders-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affective disorders, a set of neuropsychiatric diseases also known as mood disorders, include depression and anxiety. These disorders are emerging as a major public health challenge and, despite efforts in the last two decades, the biological mechanisms underlying such diseases remain elusive and poorly understood. Indeed, altered synaptic functions as well as aberrant connectivity and plasticity have been proposed as critical players in the etiology of affective disorders. Importantly, disruption of synaptic proteins often occurs in these pathological conditions (&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/jphysiol.2008.167742/abstract&quot;&gt;Luscher and Isaac, 2009&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurabins and affective disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180638&quot;&gt;PLOS One article&lt;/a&gt;, Wu and colleagues (University of Alabama at Birmingham) decided to investigate the potential role of two synaptic proteins: neurabin and spinophilin. These two proteins, also known as neurabin I and II, are homologous scaffold proteins located at the synaptic level. However, a slight difference in their synaptic location exists. In fact, while neurabin has been shown to be located at both pre- and post-synaptic levels, the other homologue protein spinophillin is primarily located at the post-synaptic site, more specifically in dendritic spines. Evidence suggests that both scaffold proteins are involved in cellular processes such as spinogenesis, dendritic spine maturation and cytoskeletal regulation. At the molecular level, neurabin and spinophilin regulate AMPA receptor trafficking, a key phenomenon able to affect fast excitatory synaptic transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using knock-out (KO) animal models for neurabin and spinophilin, Wu and colleagues aimed to understand their contribution in anxiety- and depression-related behaviors. “&lt;em&gt;Our data reveal that, despite the structural similarities between neurabin and spinophilin, and their overlapping function in regulating the synaptic cytoskeleton, inactivation of each gene caused distinct behavioral phenotypes,&lt;/em&gt;” report the authors. Because aging is a physiological variable able to constantly reshape synapses and their molecular machineries, neurabin- and spinophilin-deficient mice were studied at different ages: young (3-5 months old) and middle-aged (11-13 months old) adults. To investigate the consequences of neurabin and/or spinophilin deficiency, Wu et al. used well-established behavioral paradigms known to reveal anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes, notably the elevated zero maze (anxiety) and the forced swim test (behavioral despair, depression).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety- and depression-like phenotype in neurabin-deficient mice. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel and stressful environments evoke conflicts in rodents between exploratory drive and fear/defensive behavior. When allowed to make a choice between two novel areas, closed areas are preferred. Because of the elevated nature of the platform in the elevated zero maze, rodents tend to spend more time in the closed regions than in the open ones. Interestingly, genetic ablation of neurabin, but not spinophilin, in young adult mice induced an anxiolytic-like effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral despair, a depression-like phenotype, was assessed using the forced swim test (FST). The FST has been described as rendering a situation in which &lt;em&gt;behavioral despair&lt;/em&gt; is induced; that is, the animal loses hope to escape the stressful environment. In the FST mice are placed in an inescapable transparent tank that is filled with water and their mobility or immobility is measured. The lower the mobility (higher the immobility), the higher the despair. Surprisingly, a differential regulation of depression-like behavior was observed in neurabin KO and spinophilin KO mice. In fact, while spinophilin-deficient mice displayed a significantly increased immobility time (increased behavioral despair) during the first day of FST, neurabin-deficient mice showed a reduction of such behavior, thus suggesting a reduction of depression-like phenotype. “&lt;em&gt;These data suggest that loss of neurabin leads to reduced depression-like behavior in young adult mice, and that neurabin and spinophilin play different roles in regulating depression-like behavior&lt;/em&gt;”, say Qin Wang, the senior author of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurabins, aging and affective disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about aged mice? As mentioned above, aging shapes synaptic functions. Thus, Wu and co-authors decided to perform the same behavioral investigations in middle-aged mice. Unexpectedly, middle-aged KO mice behaved differently compared to young adults. In fact, middle-aged spinophilin KO mice were less anxious, whereas the anxiolytic effect of genetic neurabin loss observed in the younger mice was absent in the older individuals. A similar scenario was observed during the characterization of depression-like behavior in middle-aged mice: loss of spinophilin imparted an apparent protective effect in terms of the depression-like behavior of swimming-induced learned helplessness at this age, whereas neurabin-deficient mice looked normal. It is worth mentioning that while neurabin KO mice display deficient long-term potentiation (LTP) but normal long-term depression (LTD), spinophilin KO mice show impaired LTD but normal LTP (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16600521&quot;&gt;Allen et al., 2006&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Our data&lt;/em&gt;”, conclude the authors, “&lt;em&gt;indicate that these two homologous proteins play important, yet distinct, roles in the regulation of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, as well overall activity level, in an age-dependent manner. Our study therefore provides new insights into the complex neurobiology of affective disorders.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetics and caveats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this study may help to dissect the molecular and functional mechanisms underlying affective disorders, several caveats arise from the genetic strategy used in the study. In particular, complete deletion of a gene (neurabin, spinophilin, or other) may trigger maladaptive and compensatory modifications which may lead to erroneous interpretations. In addition, developmental arrangements may occur, thus leading to abnormal phenotypes. Indeed, strategies using conditional, tissue- and cell type-specific engineered mice must be encouraged in order to clearly establish functional roles of specific molecular actors.&lt;/p&gt;

 Lumosity &quot;brain training&quot; games have no beneficial effects on cognition, according to a paper just published in the Journal of Neuroscience.



According to the authors, led by UPenn psychologist Joseph W. Kable, Lumosity &quot;appears to have no benefits in healthy young adults above those of standard video games.&quot;

In the study, 128 young adults were randomly assigned to either 10 weeks of Lumosity training, or a control condition: 10 weeks of playing normal, non-brain-based online videogames</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Biomedical signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) are the time varying signal, and different position of electrodes give different time varying signals. There might be a correlation between these signals. It is likely that the correlation is related to the actual position of electrodes. In this paper, we show that correlation is related to the physical distance between electrodes as measured. This finding is independent of participants and brain hemisphere. Our results indicate that the EEG signal is not transmitted via neurons but through white matter in a brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying people who have brain damage or illness has been hugely important to progress in psychology. The approach is akin to reverse engineering: study how things go wrong when particular regions of the brain are compromised and it provides useful clues as to how those regions usually contribute to healthy mental function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, some neuropsychological conditions, such as Broca’s aphasia (speech deficits), prosopagnosia (a difficulty recognising faces, also known somewhat misleadingly as “face blindness”) and Alien Hand syndrome (a limb seeming to act of its own volition) have become extremely well-known – at least in psychological circles – and extensively studied. However, others are virtually unheard of, even though their importance to our understanding of the brain is significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuropsychologist Alfredo Ardila at Florida International University has just published &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-28540-001/&quot;&gt;in the journal &lt;em&gt;Psychology and Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an overview of four of these little-known conditions, “so rare that they are not even mentioned in basic neuropsychology textbooks”: Central achromatopsia, Bálint’s syndrome, Pure-word deafness, and aphasia of the supplementary area. This follows &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/acn/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/arclin/acw021&quot;&gt;a paper he published last year&lt;/a&gt; covering four other rare but important neuropsychological syndromes: Somatoparaphrenia, Akinetopsia, Reduplicative Paramnesia, Autotopagnosia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In neuropsychology … there are some unusual syndromes that are found very sporadically,” he writes. “But their rarity does not diminish their importance in the fundamental understanding about the brain organisation of cognition, as well as in clinical analysis of patients with brain pathologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a brief breakdown of what Ardila has to say about these rare conditions and why they’re important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-26652&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Akinetopsia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Imagine if someone pressed pause on your view of the world: that may be what’s it’s like for patients with akinetopsia, who are unable to see movement, even though they can perceive the sound of motion. The syndrome is associated with damage to a specific region of the brain’s visual cortex (area V5) and it can be induced in healthy volunteers by using transcranial magnetic stimulation to induce a “virtual lesion” in that same brain region. Akinetopsia is extremely rare but may be associated with the &lt;em&gt;Zeitraffer&lt;/em&gt; phenomenon, which is when patients perceive the speed of moving objects as noticeably slowed down. “The description of akinetopsia represents a crucial step in the comprehension of how motion perception is organized in the brain,” notes Ardila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aphasia of the Supplementary Motor Area&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In this condition, patients have a particular problem speaking spontaneously. They can repeat things back when asked, and name things when prompted, but they don’t seem to be able to initiate speech. The region of the brain that’s affected – the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) – is involved in preparing and initiating movements, especially sequences of movements, and it’s thought this form of aphasia (arising from damage to the SMA) is due to problems with planning the movements required for spontaneous speech, rather than a language problem per se. Language comprehension is mostly unaffected. “Aphasia of the SMA illustrates the complex overlap between language and motor processes, which has contributed positively to further our understanding about brain representation of linguistic processes,” Ardila said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autotopagnosia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is the inability to locate and identify parts of one’s body even though the ability to locate and name the parts of objects, plants or animals is unaffected. The condition can be seen as an impairment in updating the body schema – the brain’s representation of the body and where it is located in space – combined with a naming impairment, suggesting that language deficits are involved. The condition is usually associated with damage to the rear of the parietal cortex (near the crown of the head) in the left hemisphere. “Although autotopagnosia was described over a century ago, research has been limited,” says Ardila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bálint’s syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Also first described over a century ago, people with this condition often behave as if they are blind. Associated with damage or pathology to the parietal and occipital lobes, this syndrome is really a complex involving three sub-syndromes: simultanagnosia which is the inability to perceive an entire scene, even while being able to see individual elements within it; optic ataxia, which is a problem reaching to specific objects even though the patient has no muscular or motor problems per se; and gaze apraxia, which describes the way the patient will struggle to move their eyes voluntarily or to keep fixated on an object. Ardila says “this is one of the clinical syndromes which has most contributed to the understanding of visual and spatial perception.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Central Achromatopsia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is the loss of the ability to perceive colours caused entirely by damage to parts of the brain, usually in the occipital or temporal lobe (located near the back and sides of the head), rather than to any problem with the eyes. It can co-occur with other conditions such as prosopagnosia, but importantly the ability to imagine or visualise colours is preserved. “Evidently this syndrome is crucial to understand the brain organisation of visual perception, particularly colour perception,” writes Ardila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pure-word Deafness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Patients with this condition display a profound problem understanding spoken language, even though their ability to read and to speak is completely unaffected. Patients describe speech sounding as if it is a barely audible whisper or as if it is a foreign language. Unlike  other conditions that affect language comprehension, such as Wernicke’s aphasia, pure-word deafness is considered a purely perceptual impairment and consistent with this, it is often associated with lesions to auditory processing regions in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduplicative Paramnesias&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This extraordinary condition leads patients to believe that a particular place, such as their home or even an entire city, has been duplicated and is located in two places at once. Less often, patients may express the same belief about a person, a particular object or a body part. Forms of reduplicative paramnesia have some similarities with other delusional syndromes to do with identity, such as &lt;em&gt;capgras syndrome&lt;/em&gt; in which the patient believes one or more of their relatives or friends have been replaced with imposters; &lt;em&gt;Frégoli syndrome&lt;/em&gt;, the belief that someone, usually a perceived stalker, is repeatedly changing their appearance; and &lt;em&gt;intermetamorphosis – &lt;/em&gt;the belief that someone has transformed into another person. The evidence suggests that reduplicative paramnesias for place are often associated with damage to the right hemisphere of the brain, and are perhaps more likely due to this organic damage, whereas Ardila proposes that the other delusional identity syndromes may more often have a psychological cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Somatoparaphrenia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
First described in 1942, patients with this syndrome deny owning one or more of their limbs on the opposite side of their body to where they have damage in their brains. The syndrome tends to co-occur with another syndrome known as anosognosia, which is a denial of an impairment, such as paralysis to a limb. Somatoparaphrenia can also be seen as a more extreme version of &lt;em&gt;hemiasomatognosia&lt;/em&gt;, which is a lack of awareness of one’s own limb(s). Curiously, patients with somatoparaphrenia may recognise an affected limb as theirs when they see it in a mirror. Ardila says the condition, which has been associated with lesions to multiple regions in the brain, is little understood and may partly be a psychiatric condition (a form of delusion) as well as neurological. “In this regard, the analysis of somatoparaphrenia may contribute to further our understanding about the neurological bases of psychosis,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/07/12/are-sleep-apps-effective-tools-for-behavioral-change/"/>
		<id>http://brainblogger.com/?p=22659</id>
		<updated>2017-07-12T15:00:04+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Smartphones are technological Swiss Army knives – easy to carry and, thanks to apps, able to do almost anything. All you need is a smartphone and an internet connection to unfold a thousand tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apps make communication, traveling, working, and entertainment easier. And they can also allow us to monitor and manage our health, fitness and lifestyle, or even improve them. There are thousands of health and lifestyle apps – for exercise, for nutrition, for weight loss, for &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/08/07/top-meditation-apps/&quot;&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt;, for overall health, for sleep… Their use is on the rise and they have shown great potential in effectively promoting self-improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology may actually revolutionize how we take care of ourselves. It can successfully influence behavior and this is empowering in the sense that it offers an opportunity to self-manage our health routines. Apps can be a great aid for lifestyle interventions – they allow us to monitor our behavior and our progress, they can motivate us, give positive reinforcement, and set goals for continued enhancement. A well-designed app, built on scientific background may offer valuable help to behavioral health and lifestyle interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But among the sea of apps, one wonders how many are really effective and how many present evidence-based content and behavioral theory-based interventions. Although it is not clear whether evidence- and theory-based interventions are indispensable for the efficacy of an app, they are known to be effective in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2009/03/22/changing-the-error-of-our-ways/&quot;&gt;changing behavior&lt;/a&gt;, being, most likely, a predictor of efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional theory-based behavioral modification strategies state that behavioral change can be most successfully achieved when multiple strategic approaches and behavioral constructs are combined; these include informational strategies (creating knowledge); cognitive strategies, such as perceived benefits, barriers and risks; behavioral strategies, such as self-monitoring, realistic goal-setting, self-reward, relapse prevention; emotion-focused strategies, such as stress and negative affect management; and therapeutic interventions such as skill-building, for example. Apps that include such features have been proven more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, app developers are naturally focused on keeping users engaged. Therefore, many app features may tend to favor usability. Also, it is likely that app development may be preferentially aligned with more contemporary &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2008/10/01/sleep-deprivation-behavior-and-the-young/&quot;&gt;behavioral models&lt;/a&gt;. These postulate that technology can be designed to change user attitudes and behaviors through persuasion and social influence (Persuasive Technology Theory), and that when technology increases motivation and capacity to change, triggers to change behavior are more likely to work (Fogg Behavioral Model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a reliance on either traditional or contemporary behavioral models does not seem to be the case for most health, fitness and lifestyle apps: a 2011 review revealed that most had insufficient evidence-based content; a 2012 analysis showed a general lack of theory-based strategies; a 2013 study of exercise apps found that, overall, the apps contained few features based on behavioral change theory; another 2013 study reached the same conclusion for weight management apps; a 2015 study reported similar findings for alcohol reduction apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what about &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/15/why-do-we-need-to-sleep/&quot;&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; apps? They are one of the most popular type of lifestyle and health apps, which comes as no surprise – sleep disorders affect millions of people and this creates a huge demand for interventional strategies. But sleep apps are particular in the sense that interventional constructs need to go way beyond motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, a new study aimed at determining whether sleep apps follow evidenced-based guidelines or are grounded in behavioral change or persuasive technology theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study included the most downloaded and reviewed sleep apps for both iOS and Android. From the 369 apps found using the term “sleep” (in September 2015), 35 apps met the authors’ inclusion criteria. They scored them based on the presence of behavioral and persuasive technology constructs and correlated these scores with the average user rating for each app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average behavioral construct score was 34%, whereas the average persuasive technology score was 42%, which is not impressive. Realistic goal setting (86%), &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/04/ill-do-it-later-brain-connectivity-predicts-procrastination/&quot;&gt;time management&lt;/a&gt; (77%), and self-monitoring (66%) were the behavioral constructs most commonly included in sleep apps; factors that contributed most to the apps’ persuasiveness were the user interface (94%), provision of positive feedback (54%), and social praise (40%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the authors found a positive association between the presence of behavioral constructs and the apps’ popularity and ratings, showing that a good scientific design is an indication of probable success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also indicates that, since there is still a relatively poor inclusion of theory-based constructs, there is room to grow. Building strong evidence-based apps is likely to result in a real opportunity for effective behavioral intervention and be beneficial to the management of sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(An important side note: one obvious limitation of using &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/02/22/what-do-smartphones-do-to-the-brain/&quot;&gt;smartphone&lt;/a&gt; apps for sleep management is the well-known negative impact of LED devices on the circadian rhythm and, consequently, on sleep.

 &lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;let-s-not-let-our-choice-of-platform-limit-us&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let's not let our choice of platform limit us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are usually multiple platforms that provide similar functions. For instance, one can pick between &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gitlab.com&quot;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bitbucket.com&quot;&gt;BitBucket&lt;/a&gt; for collaborative development interfaces, and one certainly should have the freedom to do so. Similarly, one can use different operating systems, web browsers, phones, etc etc etc. But, one must remember is that for a lot of us, these are simply means to an end - not the end themselves. They are tools that facilitate the completion of our goals. Different individuals or teams preferring different platforms should not hamper collaboration under any circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to communcation, different teams use different platforms. Some prefer e-mails - either private or using a mailing list. E-mails work well, but they're often overkill for simpler tasks. They're also not the best mode for quick collaborative development. This is where real-time chat comes in. Most open source communities maintain both mailing lists and chat infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to chat platforms too, there are multiple options. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gitter.im&quot;&gt;Gitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://riot.im&quot;&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt; are designed to handle large communities and are therefore, usually preferred by open source communities. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://slack.com&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; seems to be preferred by smaller teams. There are others - &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://mattermost.com&quot;&gt;Mattermost&lt;/a&gt;, for example, but I haven't much experience with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, I've found people wary of hopping on to a different platform simply because it's too much work to set up yet another client that one must then also monitor. While this is understandable, it then has what I consider quite a major downside - limited communication amongst groups that are on different platforms. Fortunately, most platforms support bridges which lets the user connect them with other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;riot-bringing-it-all-together-in-once-place&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Riot - bringing it all together in once place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external image-reference&quot; href=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/blog/images/20170628-riot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Using riot to access IRC, Slack, and Gitter&quot; class=&quot;text-center img-responsive pagination-centered&quot; src=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/blog/images/20170628-riot.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 70%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://riot.im&quot;&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt; is an Open source platform that uses the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://matrix.org/&quot;&gt;Matrix&lt;/a&gt; protocol. It's similar to &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;, but it's a lot more usable. and what is better, one can integrate &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://slack.com&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gitter.im&quot;&gt;Gitter&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://riot.im&quot;&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt; - so one can interact with users over all these platforms in one place. For example, the image below shows &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://riot.im/app/#/room/%23neuroscience-central-lobby:matrix.org&quot;&gt;Neuroscience-central/Lobby&lt;/a&gt; room  that I've set up on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://riot.im&quot;&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt;. But, I've also gone ahead and connected this room to the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gitter.im/neuroscience-central/Lobby&quot;&gt;Neuroscience-central/Lobby room on Gitter&lt;/a&gt;, and to the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#neuroscience-central-lobby&quot;&gt;#neuroscience-central-lobby channel on IRC&lt;/a&gt;. So, everyone on any of these platforms can communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external image-reference&quot; href=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/blog/images/20170628-riot-gitter.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Neuroscience-Central/Lobby on Riot integrated with the same room on Gitter.&quot; class=&quot;text-center img-responsive pagination-centered&quot; src=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/blog/images/20170628-riot-gitter.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 70%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting up the integrations is rather easy too. One needs to go to the integrations tab and set them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external image-reference&quot; href=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/blog/images/20170628-riot-integrations.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Integrations on Riot&quot; class=&quot;text-center img-responsive pagination-centered&quot; src=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/blog/images/20170628-riot-integrations.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 70%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://riot.im/desktop.html&quot;&gt;desktop clients&lt;/a&gt; available for &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://riot.im&quot;&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt; too. (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/taw/Riot/&quot;&gt;Here's a COPR for Fedora&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://opensource.com/article/17/5/introducing-riot-IRC&quot;&gt;Here's a great post on opensource.com&lt;/a&gt; discussing &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://riot.im&quot;&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you're an admin looking to set up a new chat channel - consider setting up on different platforms and integrating them with &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://riot.im&quot;&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt; - it'll make things a lot easier for your users.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxvii-the-paradox-of-the-efficient-code-and-the-neural-tower-of-babel/"/>

		<updated>2017-07-12T09:43:58+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="fr-FR">
 &lt;p&gt;A pervasive metaphor in neuroscience is the idea that neurons “encode” stuff: some neurons encode pain; others encode the location of a sound; maybe a population of neurons encode some other property of objects. What does this mean? In essence, that there is a correspondence between some objective property and neural activity: when I feel pain, this neuron spikes; or, the image I see is “represented” in the firing of visual cortical neurons. The mapping between the objective properties and neural activity is the “code”. How insightful is this metaphor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An encoded message is understandable to the extent that the reader knows the code. But the problem with applying this metaphor to the brain is only the encoded message is communicated, not the code, and not the original message. Mathematically, original message = encoded message + code, but only one term is communicated. This could still work if there were a universal code that we could assume all neurons can read, the “language of neurons”, or if somehow some information about the code could be gathered from the encoded messages themselves. Unfortunately, this is in contradiction with the main paradigm in neural coding theory, “efficient coding”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficient coding hypothesis stipulates that neurons encode signals into spike trains in an efficient way, that is, it uses a code such that all redundancy is removed from the original message while preserving information, in the sense that the encoded message can be mapped back to the original message (Barlow, 1961; Simoncelli, 2003). This implies that with a perfectly efficient code, encoded messages are undistinguishable from random. Since the code is determined on the statistics of the inputs and only the encoded messages are communicated, a code is efficient to the extent that it is not understandable by the receiver. This is the paradox of the efficient code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the neural coding metaphor, the code is private and specific to each neuron. If we follow this metaphor, this means that all neurons speak a different language, a language that allows expressing concepts very concisely but that no one else can understand. Thus, according to the coding metaphor, the brain is a Tower of Babel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can this work?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;As the first cohort of women leaders began pushing up against the glass ceiling, many hoped it would shatter… but it only cracked. Today fewer than 10 per cent of Fortune 500 companies are led by people from ethnic minority groups and women combined, and although the reasons are manifold, blame has been laid at the feet of the early pioneers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accusation is that successful people from underrepresented groups act as gatekeepers, keeping out others to maintain their special status and to identify with the dominant majority (the most famous example being the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2010/11/11/queen-bees-are-the-consequence-not-the-cause-of-sexist-work-places/&quot;&gt;Queen Bee syndrome&lt;/a&gt; where a female boss undermines other women). But &lt;a href=&quot;http://amj.aom.org/content/60/2/771.abstract?etoc&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;i&gt;Academy of Management Journal&lt;/i&gt; suggests a different and very understandable reason that minority members are cautious to show enthusiasm for increasing diversity – because they know it could spell disaster for their own career if they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-26633&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The international team headed by David Hekman of the University of Colorado recruited 350 American executives from a range of organisations: one in ten of them were non-White and about 30 per cent were women. The executives’ bosses and roughly three of their peers rated them in terms of their competence and performance, including readiness to be promoted, and their diversity-valuing behaviour, an example being “values working with a diverse group of people”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last measure of “promoting diversity” is considered important in most major organisations, as it can provide better coverage of customer needs and can facilitate different ways of thinking. Overall, the findings from the current study were consistent with this: participants who were rated higher for diversity-valuing behaviour were also rated higher for performance and competence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was an important exception. For female and non-White executives, the more they valued diversity, the worse they were rated for performance and competence. And the non-White leaders who received very high performance ratings (higher even than the White majority) showed the least interest in diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors argue that this points to an attitudinal bias, whereby most senior staff generally see diversity-promoting behaviour as benign or even worthwhile… except when it comes from minorities, in which case, it triggers concerns of nepotism or of opposition to the interests of the majority and a desire to undermine the status quo. In turn, these concerns may reinforce the minority status of the individual, making stereotypic negative judgments more salient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this explanation, Hekman’s team conducted an experiment: 300 participants recruited from an online database were asked to review a hiring manager’s decision to take on a new Vice President for their organisation, and rate that manager’s competence accordingly. Participants saw photos of the new VP and the hiring manager and they read a transcript of the conversation about the hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a female or non-White hiring manager took on a female or minority VP and mentioned improving diversity as a motive, the participants gave them poor ratings, a cost that was not incurred by White male hiring managers making the same decision. This seems to back up the researchers’ theory that minority managers are perceived negatively when they actively promote diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, there are selfish incentives for successful members of minority groups to identify with the higher-status in-group, to be included and welcomed and feel like a member of the elite in good standing. This research suggests that there may also be valid reasons for minority leaders to fear making a show of helping other minority individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hekman’s team discuss a few possible ways to tackle this, and suggest an intriguing approach: to reward any organisational member that hires someone demographically different from them. This rule would apply to everyone, with a sound logic – what might you learn from a second-in-command with a different background to you? – and in practice, its application would increase minority numbers by virtue of the sheer numbers of majority group members seeking out someone different. Whatever the exact approach, one takeaway from this is that it is going to be harder for minorities to promote diversity in organisations, because their motives are going to be taken as suspect. So White men who care about diversity should step up and make the case for it. They are relatively insulated, whereas for others, the case may be simply too costly to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://amj.aom.org/content/60/2/771.abstract?etoc&quot;&gt;Does Diversity-Valuing Behavior Result in Diminished Performance Ratings for Non-White and Female Leaders?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/07/net-neutrality-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLOS works to remove barriers to public access of scientific research. Typically, these barriers are considered in terms of copyrights and journal subscriptions, but unfettered access to network infrastructure also contributes to supporting readers’ access to scientific literature. In simple terms, unencumbered dissemination of scientific research depends on a fair Internet. The provision of a fair and open Internet lies in the hands of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and government agencies that regulate these providers. PLOS supported the July 12, 2017 Day of Action in the United States, led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Battle for the Net&lt;/a&gt;, aimed at publicizing the issues surrounding Open Internet Rules and their critical role in maintaining Internet freedoms as currently in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2015, the US Federal Communication Commission (FCC) reclassified broadband providers as common carriers rather than information providers under Title II of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Act_of_1934&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Communications Act of 1934&lt;/a&gt;, the law that continues to regulate modern communication modes such as the Internet. This gave the FCC authority to ensure that established, large corporations including AT&amp;amp;T, Comcast and Verizon can’t block, slow (throttle) or otherwise interfere with Internet traffic. Innovations in online businesses and services, including those of PLOS, have thrived under Title II regulations. Importantly, these regulations in the US provide each and every user of the Internet a guarantee that ISPs and government regulators treat all data on the Internet the same, without discriminating against or charging differentially by user, content, website, platform, application, type of equipment or mode of communication (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;These protections are known as net neutrality; scientists and those working to support the scientific endeavor rely on net neutrality for unprejudiced access to databases, the literature and information services.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Allowing ISPs to sort traffic based on content, sender and receiver opens the door for corporate and government censorship which would greatly hinder access to scientific information around the globe.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To protect against this type of restriction in information flow, the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/open-internet-net-neutrality&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EU-wide Net Neutrality rules&lt;/a&gt; were adopted in October 2015 with public guidelines released by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://berec.europa.eu/eng/netneutrality/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications&lt;/a&gt; in late 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the US, the current FCC Commissioner wants to weaken these protections and this could have consequences for all scientists, not just those in the US: a&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ccess to information around the world could become pay to play without these protections. &lt;/strong&gt;Services provided by publishers such as PLOS and other providers could be restricted for all our users around the world, unless we pay for priority access to our content. This will affect any Internet traffic that routes through the US, from services relying on servers located in the US to requests that are routed through the US. For instance, most of the Domain Name Server (DNS) requests for South America, Central America and the Carribbean are routed by servers located in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 12, 2017, was a Day of Action in support of a fair and open Internet. Visitors to the PLOS.org homepage (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plos.org/?utm_source=plos&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos-1707-netneut&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.plos.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) and active PLOS staff blogs (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/?utm_source=plos&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos-1707-netneut&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Official PLOS Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/?utm_source=plos&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos-1707-netneut&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EveryONE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/biologue/?utm_source=plos&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos-1707-netneut&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Biologue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/?utm_source=plos&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos-1707-netneut&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Speaking of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/collections/?utm_source=plos&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos-1707-netneut&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Channels and Collections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/tech/?utm_source=plos&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos-1707-netneut&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plospodcasts/?utm_source=plos&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos-1707-netneut&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) saw a message of explanation and letter of support for net neutrality in the form of a pop up window. This message appeared only on July 12, once per site, per device. Visitors to these web pages could choose to either immediately close the pop up by clicking on the x in the upper right or fill in the four boxes to send a message to the FCC in support of its current Open Internet Rules and the efforts to dissuade FCC Chairman Ajit Varadaraj Pai from his plan to roll back these rules. Public comment continues for an additional 60 days following the Day of Action. Form letters or personalized comments may be sent directly from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.battleforthenet.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS purposefully did not place this notice on any journal content or information pages, so that access to our content was not impeded in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about net neutrality around the globe, visit &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisisnetneutrality.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.thisisnetneutrality.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;; to learn more about the Day of Action visit &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was edited slightly on July 13, 2017 to indicate past tense for the Day of Action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 In mammals, chromatin organization undergoes drastic reprogramming after fertilization. However, the three-dimensional structure of chromatin and its reprogramming in preimplantation development remain poorly understood. Here, by developing a low-input Hi-C (genome-wide chromosome conformation capture) approach, we examined the reprogramming of chromatin organization during early development in mice. We found that oocytes in metaphase II show homogeneous chromatin folding that lacks detectable topologically associating domains (TADs) and chromatin compartments. Strikingly, chromatin shows greatly diminished higher-order structure after fertilization. Unexpectedly, the subsequent establishment of chromatin organization is a prolonged process that extends through preimplantation development, as characterized by slow consolidation of TADs and segregation of chromatin compartments. The two sets of parental chromosomes are spatially separated from each other and display distinct compartmentalization in zygotes. Such allele separation and allelic compartmentalization can be found as late as the 8-cell stage. Finally, we show that chromatin compaction in preimplantation embryos can partially proceed in the absence of zygotic transcription and is a multi-level hierarchical process. Taken together, our data suggest that chromatin may exist in a markedly relaxed state after fertilization, followed by progressive maturation of higher-order chromatin architecture during early development.

 &lt;p&gt;
 How a sensory stimulus is processed and perceived depends on the surrounding sensory scene. In the visual cortex, contextual signals can be conveyed by an extensive network of intra- and inter-areal excitatory connections that link neurons representing stimulus features separated in visual space. However, the connectional logic of visual contextual inputs remains unknown; it is not clear what information individual neurons receive from different parts of the visual field, nor how this input relates to the visual features that a neuron encodes, defined by its spatial receptive field. Here we determine the organization of excitatory synaptic inputs responding to different locations in the visual scene by mapping spatial receptive fields in dendritic spines of mouse visual cortex neurons using two-photon calcium imaging. We find that neurons receive functionally diverse inputs from extended regions of visual space. Inputs representing similar visual features from the same location in visual space are more likely to cluster on neighbouring spines. Inputs from visual field regions beyond the receptive field of the postsynaptic neuron often synapse on higher-order dendritic branches. These putative long-range inputs are more frequent and more likely to share the preference for oriented edges with the postsynaptic neuron when the receptive field of the input is spatially displaced along the axis of the receptive field orientation of the postsynaptic neuron. Therefore, the connectivity between neurons with displaced receptive fields obeys a specific rule, whereby they connect preferentially when their receptive fields are co-oriented and co-axially aligned. This organization of synaptic connectivity is ideally suited for the amplification of elongated edges, which are enriched in the visual environment, and thus provides a potential substrate for contour integration and object grouping.

 DNA is an excellent medium for archiving data. Recent efforts have illustrated the potential for information storage in DNA using synthesized oligonucleotides assembled in vitro. A relatively unexplored avenue of information storage in DNA is the ability to write information into the genome of a living cell by the addition of nucleotides over time. Using the Cas1–Cas2 integrase, the CRISPR–Cas microbial immune system stores the nucleotide content of invading viruses to confer adaptive immunity. When harnessed, this system has the potential to write arbitrary information into the genome. Here we use the CRISPR–Cas system to encode the pixel values of black and white images and a short movie into the genomes of a population of living bacteria. In doing so, we push the technical limits of this information storage system and optimize strategies to minimize those limitations. We also uncover underlying principles of the CRISPR–Cas adaptation system, including sequence determinants of spacer acquisition that are relevant for understanding both the basic biology of bacterial adaptation and its technological applications. This work demonstrates that this system can capture and stably store practical amounts of real data within the genomes of populations of living cells.

 After liver injury, regeneration occurs through self-replication of hepatocytes. In severe liver injury, hepatocyte proliferation is impaired—a feature of human chronic liver disease. It is unclear whether other liver cell types can regenerate hepatocytes. Here we use two independent systems to impair hepatocyte proliferation during liver injury to evaluate the contribution of non-hepatocytes to parenchymal regeneration. First, loss of β1-integrin in hepatocytes with liver injury triggered a ductular reaction of cholangiocyte origin, with approximately 25% of hepatocytes being derived from a non-hepatocyte origin. Second, cholangiocytes were lineage traced with concurrent inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation by β1-integrin knockdown or p21 overexpression, resulting in the significant emergence of cholangiocyte-derived hepatocytes. We describe a model of combined liver injury and inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation that causes physiologically significant levels of regeneration of functional hepatocytes from biliary cells.

 When flying or swimming, animals must adjust their own movement to compensate for displacements induced by the flow of the surrounding air or water. These flow-induced displacements can most easily be detected as visual whole-field motion with respect to the animal’s frame of reference. Despite this, many aquatic animals consistently orient and swim against oncoming flows (a behaviour known as rheotaxis) even in the absence of visual cues. How animals achieve this task, and its underlying sensory basis, is still unknown. Here we show that, in the absence of visual information, larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) perform rheotaxis by using flow velocity gradients as navigational cues. We present behavioural data that support a novel algorithm based on such local velocity gradients that fish use to avoid getting dragged by flowing water. Specifically, we show that fish use their mechanosensory lateral line to first sense the curl (or vorticity) of the local velocity vector field to detect the presence of flow and, second, to measure its temporal change after swim bouts to deduce flow direction. These results reveal an elegant navigational strategy based on the sensing of flow velocity gradients and provide a comprehensive behavioural algorithm, also applicable for robotic design, that generalizes to a wide range of animal behaviours in moving fluids.

 Protective high-affinity antibody responses depend on competitive selection of B cells carrying somatically mutated B-cell receptors by follicular helper T (TFH) cells in germinal centres. The rapid T–B-cell interactions that occur during this process are reminiscent of neural synaptic transmission pathways. Here we show that a proportion of human TFH cells contain dense-core granules marked by chromogranin B, which are normally found in neuronal presynaptic terminals storing catecholamines such as dopamine. TFH cells produce high amounts of dopamine and release it upon cognate interaction with B cells. Dopamine causes rapid translocation of intracellular ICOSL (inducible T-cell co-stimulator ligand, also known as ICOSLG) to the B-cell surface, which enhances accumulation of CD40L and chromogranin B granules at the human TFH cell synapse and increases the synapse area. Mathematical modelling suggests that faster dopamine-induced T–B-cell interactions increase total germinal centre output and accelerate it by days. Delivery of neurotransmitters across the T–B-cell synapse may be advantageous in the face of infection.

 &lt;p&gt;
 For many enveloped viruses, binding to a receptor(s) on a host cell acts as the first step in a series of events culminating in fusion with the host cell membrane and transfer of genetic material for replication. The envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer on the surface of HIV is responsible for receptor binding and fusion. Although Env can tolerate a high degree of mutation in five variable regions (V1–V5), and also at N-linked glycosylation sites that contribute roughly half the mass of Env, the functional sites for recognition of receptor CD4 and co-receptor CXCR4/CCR5 are conserved and essential for viral fitness. Soluble SOSIP Env trimers are structural and antigenic mimics of the pre-fusion native, surface-presented Env, and are targets of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Thus, they are attractive immunogens for vaccine development. Here we present high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of subtype B B41 SOSIP Env trimers in complex with CD4 and antibody 17b, or with antibody b12, at resolutions of 3.7 Å and 3.6 Å, respectively. We compare these to cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of B41 SOSIP Env trimers with no ligand or in complex with either CD4 or the CD4-binding-site antibody PGV04 at 5.6 Å, 5.2 Å and 7.4 Å resolution, respectively. Consequently, we present the most complete description yet, to our knowledge, of the CD4–17b-induced intermediate and provide the molecular basis of the receptor-binding-induced conformational change required for HIV-1 entry into host cells. Both CD4 and b12 induce large, previously uncharacterized conformational rearrangements in the gp41 subunits, and the fusion peptide becomes buried in a newly formed pocket. These structures provide key details on the biological function of the type I viral fusion machine from HIV-1 as well as new templates for inhibitor design.

 Long before infants reach, crawl or walk, they explore the world by looking: they look to learn and to engage, giving preferential attention to social stimuli, including faces, face-like stimuli and biological motion. This capacity—social visual engagement—shapes typical infant development from birth and is pathognomonically impaired in children affected by autism. Here we show that variation in viewing of social scenes, including levels of preferential attention and the timing, direction and targeting of individual eye movements, is strongly influenced by genetic factors, with effects directly traceable to the active seeking of social information. In a series of eye-tracking experiments conducted with 338 toddlers, including 166 epidemiologically ascertained twins (enrolled by representative sampling from the general population), 88 non-twins with autism and 84 singleton controls, we find high monozygotic twin–twin concordance (0.91) and relatively low dizygotic concordance (0.35). Moreover, the characteristics that are the most highly heritable, preferential attention to eye and mouth regions of the face, are also those that are differentially decreased in children with autism (χ2 = 64.03, P &amp;lt; 0.0001). These results implicate social visual engagement as a neurodevelopmental endophenotype not only for autism, but also for population-wide variation in social-information seeking. In addition, these results reveal a means of human biological niche construction, with phenotypic differences emerging from the interaction of individual genotypes with early life experience.

 &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The latest article was written by our brilliant lab member Danyal Akarca. It describes some of his MPhil research which aims to explore transient brain networks in individuals with a particular type of genetic mutation. Dan finished his degree in Pre-Clinical Medicine before joining our lab and has since been fascinated by the intersection of genetic disorders and the dynamics of brain networks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain is a complex dynamic system. It can be very difficult to understand how specific differences within that system can be associated with the cognitive and behavioural difficulties that some children experience. This is because even if we group children together on the basis that they all have a particular developmental disorder, that group of children will likely have a heterogeneous aetiology. That is, even though they all fall into the same category, there may be a wide variety of different underlying brain causes. This makes these disorders notoriously difficult to study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developmental disorders that have a known genetic cause can be very useful for understanding these brain-cognition relationships, because by definition they all have the same causal mechanism (i.e. the same gene is responsible for the difficulties that each child experiences). We have been studying a language disorder caused by a mutation to a gene called &lt;em&gt;ZDHHC9&lt;/em&gt;. These children have broader cognitive difficulties, and more specific difficulties with speech production, alongside a form of childhood epilepsy called rolandic epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our lab, we have explored how brain structure is organised differently in &lt;a href=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.wordpress.com/2016/06/08/a-single-gene-disorder-affects-brain-organisation/&quot;&gt;individuals with this mutation,&lt;/a&gt; relative to typically developing controls. Since then our attention has turned to applying new analysis methods to explore differences in dynamic brain function. We have done this by directly recording magnetic fields generated by the activity of neurons, through a device known as a magnetoencephalography (MEG) scanner. The scanner uses magnetic fields generated by the brain to infer &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoencephalography&quot;&gt;electrical activity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typical way that MEG data is interpreted, is by comparing how electrical activity within the brain changes in response to a stimulus. These changes can take many forms, including how well synchronised different brain areas are, or the how size of the magnetic response differs across individuals. However, in our current work, we are trying to explore how the brain configures itself within different networks, in a dynamic fashion. This is especially interesting to us, because we think that the ZDHHC9 gene has an impact on the excitability of neurons in particular parts of the brain, specifically in those areas that are associated with language. These changes in network dynamics might be linked to the kinds of cognitive difficulties that these individuals have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used an analysis method called &lt;em&gt;“Group Level Exploratory Analysis of Networks” &lt;/em&gt;– or GLEAN for short – and has recently been developed at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2sJbg72&quot;&gt;Oxford centre for Human Brain Activity&lt;/a&gt;. The concept behind GLEAN is that the brain changes between different patterns of activation in a fashion that is probabilistic. This is much like the concept of the weather – just as the weather can change from day to day in some probabilistic way, so too may the brain change in its activation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;2a6556de3969141b8006024f2d14873e&quot; class=&quot;  wp-image-509 aligncenter&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;509&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;2a6556de3969141b8006024f2d14873e&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/2a6556de3969141b8006024f2d14873e-e1499771876691.png?w=344&amp;amp;h=247?w=474&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/2a6556de3969141b8006024f2d14873e-e1499771876691.png?w=344&amp;amp;h=247?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/2a6556de3969141b8006024f2d14873e-e1499771876691.png?w=344&amp;amp;h=247&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;480,345&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.wordpress.com/2017/07/11/the-weather-and-the-brain-new-method-for-meg-analysis/2a6556de3969141b8006024f2d14873e/&quot; height=&quot;247&quot; src=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/2a6556de3969141b8006024f2d14873e-e1499771876691.png?w=344&amp;amp;h=247&quot; width=&quot;344&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis method not only allows us to observe what regions of the brain are active when the participants are in the MEG scanner. It also allows us to see the probabilistic way in which they can change between each other. For example, just as it is more likely to transition from rain one day to cloudiness the next day, relative to say rain to blistering sun, we find that brain activation patterns can be described in a very similar way over sub-second timescales. We can characterise those dynamic transitions in lots of different ways, such as how long you stay in a specific brain state or how long does it take to return to a state once you’ve transitioned away. (A more theoretical account of this can be found in another recent blog post in our Methods section – “&lt;a href=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.wordpress.com/2016/06/03/the-resting-brain-that-never-rests/&quot;&gt;The resting brain… that never rests&lt;/a&gt;”.) We have found that a number networks differ between individuals with the mutation and our control subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Picture1&quot; class=&quot;  wp-image-529 aligncenter&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;529&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Picture1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/picture1.png?w=526&amp;amp;h=208?w=474&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/picture1.png?w=526&amp;amp;h=208?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/picture1.png?w=526&amp;amp;h=208&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;944,373&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.wordpress.com/2017/07/11/the-weather-and-the-brain-new-method-for-meg-analysis/picture1-2/&quot; height=&quot;208&quot; src=&quot;https://forgingconnectionsblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/picture1.png?w=526&amp;amp;h=208&quot; width=&quot;526&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(These are two brain networks that show the most differences in activation – largely in the parietal and frontotemporal regions of the brain.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, these networks strongly overlap with areas of the brain that are known to express the gene (we found this out by using data from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brain-map.org/&quot;&gt;Allen Atlas&lt;/a&gt;). This is the first time that we know of that researchers have been able to link a particular gene, to differences dynamic electrical brain networks, to a particular pattern of cognitive difficulties. And we are really excited!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Before-WK-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abandoned buildings are a common and unfortunate sight in communities, emerging for myriad reasons ranging from progress, which compels establishments to relocate to better serve clients, to misfortune, which prompts businesses to cease operations at particular locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many overlook dilapidated buildings altogether . . . others see opportunities for, of all things, enhancing the depth and breadth of healthcare services in communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their idled states, these buildings often fall into disrepair, diminishing scenic beauty and even posing threats to health and safety as abandoned structures are vulnerable to criminal and environmental elements. While many overlook dilapidated buildings altogether, considering them to be well suited only for the wrecking ball, others see opportunities for, of all things, enhancing the depth and breadth of healthcare services in communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Willis-Knighton Health System and adaptive reuse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shreveport, Louisiana-based Willis-Knighton Health System has extensive adaptive reuse experience and credits the practice with facilitating expansion initiatives which have improved access to care in the community. The system decided to tap into the unrealized potential of abandoned buildings beginning in the 1970s as a means of acquiring space economically as it expanded its presence in the market. Its initial repurposing endeavors proved economical and effective, compelling subsequent pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, Willis-Knighton Health System has successfully accomplished over 20 adaptive reuse projects. Its most recently completed initiative involved repurposing the former Doctors’ Hospital of Shreveport, a 150,000 square foot building that ceased operations in 2010 and quickly became a prominent blight overlooking the heart of downtown Shreveport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building, reintroduced in 2017 as the WK Rehabilitation Institute, is virtually indistinguishable from brand new construction and features an entirely revised facade, all-new interior elements, and an enhanced layout which facilitates access. The building cost $26 million (acquisition plus renovations), a bargain price, especially when considering that equivalent new construction would total $44.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9226&quot; style=&quot;width: 2410px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9226 size-full&quot; height=&quot;1590&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/After-WK.jpg&quot; width=&quot;2400&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;The WK Rehabilitation Institute, repurposed from Doctors’ Hospital. © Willis-Knighton Health System.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunities associated with adaptive reuse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential possessed by adaptive reuse to deliver significant financial savings unavailable through equivalent new construction projects is perhaps its most notable benefit. In fact, this attribute is cited as the primary motivation for its pursuit, and in each of Willis-Knighton Health System’s experiences, cost advantages over equivalent new construction scenarios were observed. This point certainly shouldn’t be lost on those serving in the healthcare industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical space required by physicians, nurses, administrators, and others to carry out their many duties often represents a significant expenditure, consuming financial resources which otherwise could be directed toward patient care. Economies achieved on this front permit more resources to be directed toward mission fulfillment activities and adaptive reuse offers a prudent method for realizing such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond financial advantages, adaptive reuse offers opportunities for healthcare entities to bolster community renewal initiatives by returning to service formerly inactive properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond financial advantages, adaptive reuse offers opportunities for healthcare entities to bolster community renewal initiatives by returning to service formerly inactive properties. Further, the practice is environmentally friendly, as repurposing abandoned buildings conserves resources and averts demolition, reducing the burden on landfills which otherwise would have to accommodate the waste. Adaptive reuse also has the potential to bring highly-prized locations in communities back into consideration in circumstances where relocations or closures present optimally situated availabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, adaptive reuse offers a unique and mutually beneficial method for addressing the spatial expansion needs of healthcare institutions, providing those serving in hospitals, medical clinics, and other care providing facilities with an option to consider beyond traditional renovation and new construction pathways. The practice by its very nature coincides nicely with the community-minded, altruistic missions typically espoused by healthcare establishments, affording an exceptional strategic fit when proper circumstances present themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional insights on the practice of adaptive reuse, including descriptions of opportunities and obstacles, case presentations profiling several of Willis-Knighton Health System’s repurposing initiatives, and a detailed operational framework, consult the associated article featured in BMC Health Services Research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of US researchers led by Lara Stemple at the UCLA School of Law has analysed data from several large federal crime victimisation surveys and they say their findings show that sexual offences by women against male and female victims are surprisingly common. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178916301446?_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_origin=gateway&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb&amp;amp;dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;Writing in &lt;em&gt;Aggression and Violent Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the researchers stress that they are in no way intending to minimise the human cost of sexual violence perpetrated by men. But they say their results are “sufficiently robust so as to compel a rethinking of long-held stereotypes about sexual victimisation and gender”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-26502&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stemple’s team begin by pointing to data from the Center For Disease Control’s Survey of thousands of people for the “National Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual Violence”. In 2011, for example, this survey showed that equal numbers of men and women reported being forced into non-consensual sex (either raped themselves or forced to penetrate someone else). Extrapolated to the US as a whole, this would represent 1.9 million victims among each sex during the preceding 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are similar findings for sex of victim in the 2010 survey, the researchers said, and that year, the survey also included detail on the sex of offender. To illustrate the prevalence of female offending, the researchers highlighted the number of men who reported being forced by a woman to penetrate her. The survey estimated that nearly 4.5 million men in the US had at some time in their lives been forced to penetrate another person, and crucially, that in 79.2 per cent of cases the perpetrator forcing the sexual act was a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another survey the researchers looked at was the National Crime Victimisation Survey, pooling the data from 2010 to 2013. This showed that female perpetrators (without a male accomplice) were reported in 28 per cent of rape or sexual assault cases against men and 4.1 per cent of such cases against female victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from prisons collected by the Bureau of Justice Statistics is equally surprising. Among female prisoners who have been the victims of sexual offences during their incarceration, they far more often report the offender to be another female inmate than a male member of staff. Indeed, contrary to stereotypes, another survey found that women prison inmates were more than three times as likely to be sexually victimised by another women inmate as compared with male prisoners’ risk of sexual victimisation by another male prisoner (bi-sexual women were at highest risk). For boys and men who are incarcerated, the prison data also show that they are overwhelmingly more likely to be sexually victimised by female staff than male staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National surveys by the U.S. Census Bureau are also revealing. A 2012 study asked respondents whether they had ever forced someone to have sex against their will: of those who said they had, 43.6 per cent were female (compared with 56.4 per cent of men).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stemple’s team also considered data from college samples. Most recently, a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college found that 43 reported having been sexually coerced, mostly unwanted sexual intercourse, with 95 per cent of the perpetrators reported as being female. An earlier survey obtained anecdotal descriptions of sexual violence from perpetrators. One woman described how she “locked the room door that we were in. I kissed and touched him. I removed his shirt and unzipped his pants. He asked me stop. I didn’t. Then I sat on top of him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the researchers say that the data challenge the one-dimensional stereotype of women as only passive and harmless. Facing up to the reality of the prevalence of female sex offences actually serves feminist goals, they argue, citing another scholar who wrote that to be fully recognised, women must be “heard in all possible forms, whether in compassion, in protest or in violence”. The results also challenge stereotypes about men, they added, such as that they have “an insatiable desire for sex”, and they challenge rape myths such as that it is impossible for “a big strong man to be raped by a woman” (which the majority of students endorsed as true in a recent survey).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it is only by recognising the reality of female sexual offending that the needs of those who offend can be properly addressed. “Female perpetration [of sexual aggression] is frequently intertwined with women’s past experience of their own victimisation”, the researchers said. For instance, evidence suggests that female offenders “have often experienced severe childhood sexual abuse themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the “culture of denial” about female sexual offending means that most female offenders are not convicted, and when they are, they receive lighter sentences, Stemple and her colleagues said. Male victims may feel pressure to interpret their victimisation experiences in a way consistent with masculine ideals, “such as the idea that men should relish any available opportunity for sex.” Meanwhile, “heterosexist” assumptions (that sexual violence is only ever perpetrated by men, usually against women) mean that lesbian and bisexual victims of female sexual aggression are “invisible to professionals”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also commonly assumed that female offenders nearly always co-offend with a male accomplice, the researchers noted, but while it is true that co-offending is more common among female offenders, data suggest they are still more likely to abuse alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We call for feminist approaches – expansively interpreted – to challenge these stereotypes, making room to consider women who are abusive, power seeking, and sexually aggressive, while taking into account the troubled background many such women possess,” the researchers concluded. “Those victimised by women are doubly harmed when we fail to treat their abuse as worthy of concern.”&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2017-07-10T15:00:16+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Treatment advances over the last several decades have dramatically extended the lifespan of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, a continuing problem in HIV treatment is the ability of the virus to remain dormant in a small number of cells throughout the body, including some areas of the brain. Researchers at the University of Montreal in Canada recently discovered a way to locate and destroy hidden HIV viral particles, a finding that could eventually lead to a complete cure for the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HIV currently affects an estimated 36.7 million people worldwide, and infects 2.1 million new individuals each year. HIV infection targets a group of immune cells called CD4+ T cells. These cells are responsible for recognizing and attacking harmful bacteria and viruses that enter the body. When a large proportion of these cells are destroyed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/05/08/hiv-medications-linked-to-increase-in-alzheimers-disease-protein/&quot;&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;, the body can no longer defend against infections and other diseases. This stage is called acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS, and frequently results in premature death due to opportunistic infections and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present treatments for HIV include reverse transcriptase inhibitors and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/05/08/hiv-medications-linked-to-increase-in-alzheimers-disease-protein/&quot;&gt;protease inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;, among several others. These drugs work by targeting the enzymes that convert viral RNA into DNA and produce mature viral particles. These drugs are highly effective and have drastically increased the life expectancy of patients. However, a complete cure for HIV has remained elusive because of the ability of the virus to remain in so-called reservoirs in the body. If a patient in remission forgoes their medication, the virus can become re-activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from several universities, led by Daniel Kauffman of the University of Montreal, recently discovered a way to identify and potentially destroy HIV reservoirs. Their findings are published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell Host and Microbe&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the researchers sought a new way to identify HIV-infected CD4+ T cells using a method called flow-FISH, which combines two techniques for identifying proteins and nucleotides in cells. Flow cytometry uses a machine to sort and identify cell subpopulations based on surface protein markers, but it is not sensitive or specific enough to identify HIV-infected cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, or FISH, uses fluorescent probes directed against specific nucleotide sequences to identify DNA or RNA in a cell with local and temporal specificity. Flow-FISH was used to detect the mRNA of two specific &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/09/08/does-hiv-make-the-brain-old-before-its-time/&quot;&gt;HIV genes&lt;/a&gt; in CD4+ T cells, &lt;em&gt;gag &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;pol&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this method, the researchers were able to detect virus-containing cells at concentrations as low as 0.5–1 per million CD4+ T cells. This assay was combined with polychromatic flow cytometry, which analyzes multiple cell surface markers simultaneously. Together, these techniques allowed the researchers to quantify and identify the characteristics of HIV-infected cells in patient blood samples. HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells showed an increase in markers of “&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2010/12/12/preventing-hiv-before-exposure/&quot;&gt;immune exhaustion&lt;/a&gt;” (PD-1, CTLA-4, and TIGIT), which occurs when T cells have been chronically activated and are no longer responsive. They also were able to estimate the size of the viral reservoir, which was on average 3.56 cells per million CD4+ T cells, but a wide variation was observed among patients on anti-viral therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next part of the study, two latency-reversal agents (LRA) were tested on cells from HIV-infected patients. LRAs are used in a “shock and kill” technique that activates dormant viral particles in the body, allowing them to be eradicated by antiretroviral agents. Bryostatin modulates protein kinase C, an enzyme involved in cell signaling pathways, and is currently being tested for use as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2008/04/01/new_anti_cancer_drug_for_aggressive_brain_tumors/&quot;&gt;anti-cancer&lt;/a&gt;, anti-HIV, and memory-enhancing agent. Ingenol is a plant-derived drug with several proposed mechanism of action that include protein kinase C activation, which leads to the activation of immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers determined that bryostatin and ingenol differed in their ability to activate two subpopulations of CD4+ T cells. Ingenol activated central memory cells, which persist for several years in patients, whereas bryostatin was not as effective against this T-cell subpopulation. This finding suggested that ingenol may be a more effective treatment for latent HIV. While both drugs were capable of killing the HIV virus &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, their effectiveness in the body remains unclear. The researchers suggest that their viral detection method will be useful for assessing the effectiveness of LRAs in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method of reactivating latent HIV provides hope for one day eradicating the virus, but it is not without the potential for side effects. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University recently tested the effect of viral reactivation by LRAs in monkeys with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), the correlate of HIV in monkeys. They found that the drug caused a harmful form of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/05/28/lack-of-sleep-affects-performance-and-damages-brain-cells/&quot;&gt;brain inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers suspect that this side effects was caused by the existence of HIV reservoirs in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIV-infected monkeys were treated with a cocktail of antiretroviral agents (tenofovir, darunavir, ritonavir, and the integrase inhibitor L-870812). Following 400 days on this regimen, viral suppression was confirmed by measuring SIV in plasma. Then two of the monkeys were treated for ten days with the latency-reversing agents ingenol-B and vorinostat. Vorinostat is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/08/best-and-worst-of-neuroscience-and-neurology-october-2015/&quot;&gt;histone deacetylase&lt;/a&gt; inhibitor that works by changing the expression of genes involved in cell differentiation. The animals continued on the antiretroviral drug cocktail during the treatment with LRAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the treated monkeys remained healthy under this treatment regimen. However, the second monkey developed symptoms of brain inflammation, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/02/08/winter-depression-new-discoveries-in-treatment-of-seasonal-affective-disorder/&quot;&gt;lethargy&lt;/a&gt; and lack of appetite. Active SIV and markers of inflammation were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. After the animal was euthanized due to the illness, they removed the brain for examination. They were careful to first remove the monkey’s blood to ensure that the brain tissue wasn’t contaminated by infected blood cells. They found that SIV was present in a part of the brain called the occipital cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery that viral reactivation can cause brain inflammation, possibly by reactivating brain reservoirs of the virus, is a potential drawback for using LRAs to treat latent HIV in humans. Reassuringly, this side effect occurred in only one of the two animals, so these findings are still preliminary. Further, while there are innate differences between SIV and HIV, clinical trials of LRA in humans with HIV must be carried out with caution. Monitoring the CSF for evidence of viral reactivation in the brain should accompany LRA treatment to prevent such side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know from past research that autistic people process the world differently at a perceptual level, including showing reduced sensitivity to context. One consequence is that they’re better than average at finding figures in complex shapes. But does this way of looking at the world also influence their higher-level decision-making? According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797617694867&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychological Science, &lt;/i&gt;it does: William Skylark and his University of Cambridge colleagues George Farmer and Simon Baron-Cohen found that people with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) – as well as people in the general population with relatively high levels of autistic traits – make more “conventionally rational” decisions, which could influence everything from how they vote to what products they choose to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-26486&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team recruited 90 men and women who had been diagnosed with an ASC and 212 neurotypical controls and presented them with ten consecutive pairs of products, which differed in each case on two dimensions (for example, one USB stick (A) had relatively high capacity but low longevity, while the other (B) had low capacity but high longevity). Each pair was also accompanied by a third “decoy” product. In every case, the participants had to choose which product was “best”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants saw each product pair twice. On one occasion, it was accompanied by a decoy that was fractionally inferior compared with product A; on the other occasion, the decoy was fractionally inferior than product B. Earlier work using this kind of challenge has shown that while people rarely choose the decoy, it makes the product that is marginally better seem more attractive than the other option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While conventional accounts of rational choice dictate that a person’s preference be independent of the other options on offer, this often isn’t actually the case. “If one prefers salmon to steak, this should not change because frogs’ legs are added to the menu,” the researchers explained. However, the thinking of neurotypical people is swayed in exactly this way and what Skylark and his colleagues wanted to know is whether the choices of people with ASC are influenced in this way too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that they were – but to a lesser extent than controls. The autistic participants made more consistent choices about which product was best, showing they were less influenced by the decoys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the team repeated the study with people drawn from the general population who scored either relatively high or relatively low on a measure of traits typically associated with autism, they found a similar, though less marked, difference between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that people with autism might be less susceptible to having their choices biased by the way information is presented to them – for instance, by marketing tricks when choosing between consumer products,” says Farmer. Indeed, given that choice consistency is usually seen as rational, autistic people’s reduced sensitivity to context “would provide a new demonstration that autism is not in all respects a ‘disability’,” the researchers wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is also work finding that in situations where someone isn’t sure about what decision to make, using context and new information about other options may be useful. (“Whereas conventional accounts of rational choice dictate choice consistency, emerging Bayesian frameworks construe preference reversals as an adaptive response to uncertainty about the value of an option,” the team explained.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there could be a price to pay for autistic people’s reduced sensitivity to contextual influence – and that “may be a reduction in the potentially adaptive updating of beliefs about optimum choice that comes from using local comparisons to inform decision-making,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617694867&quot;&gt;People With Autism Spectrum Conditions Make More Consistent Decisions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/AI-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of children who are exposed to a trauma, between 10 and 40% will develop Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a debilitating psychiatric condition that can have significant impact on a child’s functioning and, perhaps, even the development of their brain. There is also a growing literature indicating that PTSD may be prevented, if a child at risk (i.e. the 10-40%) is identified early enough. How can we know which child is at risk for PTSD – as early as possible after trauma exposure – so that this risk may be mitigated? What does the literature say about our ability to predict a child’s risk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A definitive account about the state of this literature was published a few years ago. Trickey and colleagues conducted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735811001875?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;meta-analysis of 64 studies on child PTSD risk&lt;/a&gt; published over the previous two decades, and found that the effect sizes for all but a handful of risk factors were very small: and not many more than a handful of risk variables (25) had even been studied, more than once. I have been studying risk for child PTSD since the beginning of the two-decade time span of this landmark meta-analysis, and I was not surprised by the discouraging results, reported. PTSD is a complex phenomenon. In all likelihood, its’ expression involves the complex interactions between a wide diversity of biopsychosocial processes, that engage over time – in specific ways – under specific conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been studying risk for child PTSD since the beginning of the two-decade time span of this landmark meta-analysis, and I was not surprised by the discouraging results, reported&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years before this meta-analysis was published, I became convinced that the data methods conventionally used for PTSD risk factor research could not approach the complexity of the subject under study. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0151174&quot;&gt;began to explore the application of new methods&lt;/a&gt; such as Machine Learning predictive classification, non-experimental causal discovery, and complex systems science. These methods were gaining tremendous traction in other fields for the very problems that seemed to plague research in my field. The study &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1384-1&quot;&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; entitled “Machine Learning Methods to Predict Child Posttraumatic Stress: A Proof of Concept Study” is an outcome of this effort, and reports the first ever application of Machine Learning to predict childhood PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1384-1&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; reports on a longitudinal study of children assessed in the wake of a trauma (hospitalization for an acute injury) to predict who would acquire PTSD from information available around the time of trauma. We assessed a wide variety of risk factors while the child was in the hospital including candidate genes, neurochemical and neurophysiologic responses, hospital treatment, qualities of the child’s family and early development, and parent’s stress and mental health. We then applied state-of-the-art Machine Learning methods to use all the risk information we collected, to build models of risk for PTSD, and test these models for their reliability and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9239&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9239&quot; height=&quot;188&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/artificial-intelligence-2228610_1920-300x188.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Public Domain&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is Machine Learning? Details are found in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1384-1&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; but – broadly and briefly – Machine Learning is a computational approach designed to find patterns in data that will form reliable and accurate predictive models of specified events (e.g. the occurrence of PTSD in a traumatized child). The ‘machine’ will use specified algorithms to search through the space of possibilities contained in the data, to arrive at a predictive model. The reliability and accuracy of this predictive model is then tested with data the ‘machine’ has not yet seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used five different approaches to Machine Learning predictive classification and each of the yielded models showed strong predictive performance, certainly stronger than comparisons with conventional methods. We also integrated a feature selection method designed to find the variables that had &lt;em&gt;causal&lt;/em&gt; influence on PTSD. We understand that this claim for &lt;em&gt;causality&lt;/em&gt; will often arouse incredulity within the psychiatric research community. How can we make such a claim?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that this claim for &lt;em&gt;causality&lt;/em&gt; will often arouse incredulity within the psychiatric research community. How can we make such a claim?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our causal discovery, feature selection methods are designed to find what is called the &lt;em&gt;Markov Boundary&lt;/em&gt; for a response variable (R) (e.g. PTSD). The Markov Boundary defines the set of variables that render every other variable set in the data independent of R. The Markov Boundary – in the majority of distributions – also possesses a &lt;u&gt;causal function&lt;/u&gt; as it includes the direct causes, direct effects and direct causes of the direct effects of R. When the response variable is a terminal event (i.e. no variables occur after R), then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v11/aliferis10a.html&quot;&gt;the Markov Boundary is the set of direct causes of R&lt;/a&gt;. What are the implications of finding such a Markov Boundary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our methods have enabled the discovery of the Markov Boundary for the terminal response variable of PTSD. Therefore, we have discovered the set of direct causes of PTSD. Some of you may be tempted to search through our article to find the method we used to conduct the experiment that allowed such causal inference. Alas, none will be found, and that is the point. Should we have randomly assigned a child to a trauma condition? Of course, ethical considerations cannot allow such a study and, therefore, there is no ethically allowable search for causation using conventional methods in our field. And, therefore, there is no available knowledge of causation (outside of animal research) in our field. And this is a very big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1384-1&quot;&gt;our article&lt;/a&gt;, we include many references documenting the mathematical rigor of Markov Boundary induction, and the track record of Markov Boundary induction algorithms for detecting true causes, from data sets where true causes were previously known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did we find? We found a set of causal variables, measured around the time of trauma that predicted PTSD, three months later. In this set, were specific candidate genes that may point to the potential preventative use of specific medications targeted towards the biological processes encoded by these genes. Other identified causal variables were more directly remediable, such as the child’s level of acute pain and the parent’s level of acute distress. Interestingly, we also found that the child’s history of being breast fed as an infant, and whether the child attended religious services regularly, was protective of PTSD: indicating the important role of attachment, community, and spirituality for a child’s recovery after trauma.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 Polymodal thermo- and mechanosensitive two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channels of the TREK subfamily generate ‘leak’ currents that regulate neuronal excitability, respond to lipids, temperature and mechanical stretch, and influence pain, temperature perception and anaesthetic responses. These dimeric voltage-gated ion channel (VGIC) superfamily members have a unique topology comprising two pore-forming regions per subunit. In contrast to other potassium channels, K2P channels use a selectivity filter ‘C-type’ gate as the principal gating site. Despite recent advances, poor pharmacological profiles of K2P channels limit mechanistic and biological studies. Here we describe a class of small-molecule TREK activators that directly stimulate the C-type gate by acting as molecular wedges that restrict interdomain interface movement behind the selectivity filter. Structures of K2P2.1 (also known as TREK-1) alone and with two selective K2P2.1 (TREK-1) and K2P10.1 (TREK-2) activators—an N-aryl-sulfonamide, ML335, and a thiophene-carboxamide, ML402—define a cryptic binding pocket unlike other ion channel small-molecule binding sites and, together with functional studies, identify a cation–π interaction that controls selectivity. Together, our data reveal a druggable K2P site that stabilizes the C-type gate ‘leak mode’ and provide direct evidence for K2P selectivity filter gating.
