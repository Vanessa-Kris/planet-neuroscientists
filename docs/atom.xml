 &lt;p&gt;&quot;We believe time is ripe for a functional, distributed, encrypted ledger to gain pivotal importance collectively organizing and fostering the advancement of existing and future scientific knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, at Iris.ai we propose building Aiur - a Knowledge Validation Engine. Unlike other projects to create exchange-inspired architectures where promoters sit on top [Dinkins 2017], we regard ourselves as an agent of a rich, horizontal, budding ecosystem fighting to democratize science, against many threats. Here we present a technology platform and governance structure leveraging the blockchain for both AI-contributor and AI-user flows, transparently, accountably and in scale. The AIUR tokens introduced in this white paper will run on top of the Ethereum platform in two distinct project stages. Through an initial token sale we target raising c. EUR 10,000,000 to build a fully decentralized, community-governed Knowledge Validation Engine, in line with Iris.ai’s mission and long term roadmap towards building the world’s leading machine-driven science assistant.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This article presents the results of part of an ethnographic study which examined the perceptions, development and conceptions of open access (OA) practice across the UK higher education environment. It details a qualitative semi-structured interview data capture approach with many institutionally based OA practitioners, which provided a narrative picture of academic and institutional responses to emerging OA dissemination paradigms. Through an analytical process incorporating qualitative content analysis and ideological critique, it focuses on practitioner perceptions of the types and configuration of barriers between scholars and a greater cultural adoption of OA practices. While the greatest problems perceived relate to academic intellectual disengagement or indifference to publishing praxis change, no singular cause of resistance was identified. The study reveals practitioners’ perceptions of a multiplicity of operational, technological and ideological barriers blocking progress, and consequently a picture of academic engagement remaining disappointingly patchy. Moreover, moves to increase scholarly compliance through allying it to modalities of fiscal income and metrics, while potentially enhancing practical compliance, appear to risk distorting any revolutionary configuration of OA practices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A clear association between depression, especially the major depressive disorder, oxidative stress, and accelerated aging is supported by research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression, major depressive disorder more specifically, is one of the most striking problems of modern society. Millions of people worldwide suffer from depression, with many patients not experiencing relief from symptoms. Depression is associated with increased mortality from age-related conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Researchers have suggested that depression is associated with increased oxidative stress and a disturbed immune response, which may accelerate aging and increase susceptibility to age-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the proven indicators of cellular aging is the length of telomeres. Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that cap the end of chromosomal DNA and serve to protect chromosomal integrity. They become shorter with each round of replication and cell division, meaning that normally they become shorter with age. When telomeres reach a critically short length, the cells undergo apoptosis, i.e., programmed death. Leukocyte telomere length has been typically used in clinical studies as a marker of cellular aging. They shortening accelerates in the cells subjected to oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple studies, including some meta-analysis, have questioned the association between leukocyte telomere length and major depressive disorder. For instance, one meta-analysis compared the length of telomeres between depressed and healthy individuals and found significantly shorter telomeres in groups with depression. A very recent prospective study including over 100 participants aged from 18 to 70 with or without major depressive disorder assessed telomere length at baseline and at two years follow-up. The authors concluded that individuals with major depressive disorder at baseline had significantly larger shortening of telomeres over the period of 2 years, supporting the association between depression and accelerated aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major depressive disorder is typically classified as a mental illness, but its pathology is evident in cells throughout the body. According to some researchers, several biological mediators are deregulated in this disorder that contribute to accelerated aging. These changes affect levels of genetic and epigenetic mediators (i.e., the variants of genes), and biochemical mediators such as glucocorticoids and neurosteroids. This can alter immune functions, oxidative processes, and levels of factors regulating the metabolism of glucose and production of insulin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident that deregulation of some of these biological mediators leads to oxidative stress, which seems to be highly correlated with the aging process. Oxidative damage occurs when the body can’t cope with psychological and physical stressors. In other words, oxidative stress refers to the excessive production of free radicals that cannot be completely neutralized by the body’s antioxidative mechanisms. Elevated markers of oxidative stress, along with  decreased antioxidant capacity, have been reported in subjects with depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidative damage is associated with the aging process, while markers of oxidative stress correlate with the decreased activity of an enzyme called telomerase. This enzyme is responsible for extending the length of telomeres. When telomerase is absent, the telomeres shorten faster. Thus, the link between the depression and accelerated aging can partly be explained by an increased cellular oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal studies have also been conducted in order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying major depressive disorder-mediated accelerated aging. For instance, in one study, the researchers exposed rats to mild chronic stress in order to induce the symptoms of major depressive disorder. The animals that developed these symptoms were found to have shorter telomeres and decreased telomerase activity, along with an increase in oxidative damage and decreased antioxidant enzyme activity. In addition, damaged mitochondria and reduced mitochondrial DNA content were also reported in rats with depressive symptoms. This research provided clear cellular evidence of accelerated aging associated with major depressive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of researchers proposed that early treatment (i.e., in the first half of life) of psychiatric disorders, including depression, could extend life expectancy and significantly reduce the burden of age-related disorders (such as cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer). They demonstrated that the persistence of some psychiatric disorder from the ages of 11 to 38 years led to the dose-dependent shortening of telomere length by the age of 38. Analyses of blood samples collected at the age of 26 and 38 revealed an accelerated erosion of telomeric ends in males diagnosed with the psychiatric disorder such as depression. Interestingly, there was no such association in females with a psychiatric disorder in the interim assessment at the age of 26. This research points to the link between psychiatric disorders and accelerated biological aging, which may be particularly emphasized in men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, one study investigated the association between major depressive disorder and age-related changes of the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are a set of subcortical structures involved in reward processing, which is often dysfunctional in subjects with major depressive disorder. Based on images from the brains of patients with depression and healthy controls, the authors assessed the grey matter volume of basal ganglia in their different parts. They found a negative correlation between the size of the putamen (a region of the basal ganglia located in the base of the forebrain) and age. Importantly, this association was twice as big in patients with major depressive disorder in comparison with healthy subjects. The finding of a greater age-related volume decrease in the depressed subjects, suggests that major depressive syndrome is clearly associated with accelerated aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that although various biochemical mediators are responsible for the clear association between depression and accelerated aging, oxidative stress is the largest contributor to this phenomenon. Thus, it is most likely that cellular oxidative damage caused by different psychological and physical stressors represents the underlying mechanism of depression-related accelerated aging.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&quot;Openness is a notion that is becoming increasingly topical. The question of open science is now frequently addressed in academics. Open educational resources have become more central in schools. People are sharing their vulnerabilities on social media using hashtags with references to openness. In response to this, Nordicom releases the Spring issue of the journal Nordicom Information, in which the theme is openness in media and communication.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<id>tag:biocomputation.herts.ac.uk,2018-06-11:/2018/06/11/on-reverse-nearest-neighbor-queries-emergence-and-implementation-issues.html</id>
		<updated>2018-06-11T09:39:01+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;K-Nearest Neighbor, KNN is well-known tool in data mining. KNN query returns objects in a data set that are nearest to a query object-q.  One of the shortcomings of KNN is that it is asymmetric. That is, the fact that a query point q has a data point p as its nearest neighbor does not imply that p’s nearest neighbor is q.  There may be the case in decision support system where we concern on finding influence set for a query object q. For example, opening  a new outlet of company A at particular location is more based on the segment of customers of company B ( competitor of A) who are likely to find new outlet more convenient that the location of B.  Such segments of customers can loosely refer as influence set and the reverse relationship is addressed by reverse nearest neighbor, RNN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Deepak will go through some of the papers on the implementation of RNN queries.&lt;/p&gt;

 There is a growing research literature on the 'Neuroscience of Love'. But what exactly is this 'love' that is being studied?





Sociologist Gabriel Abend asks these questions in a new paper called The Love of Neuroscience published in Sociological Theory. Last year I discussed one of Abend's previous papers which asked more general questions about how neuroscientists define the objects they study. In the new paper, Abend looks specifically at 'love' and how this word has been understood</content>

		<link href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/C33JDGXkqLE/"/>
		<id>http://blogs.plos.org/plos/?p=8233</id>
		<updated>2018-06-08T14:54:51+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The Children’s Tumor Foundation (CTF), the largest non-governmental funder of neurofibromatosis (NF) research, and PLOS ONE, a leading peer-reviewed scientific journal, are pleased to announce the successful completion of the first funding cycle of the Drug Discovery Initiative Registered Report (DDIRR) 2017 Awards, a funder-publisher partnership integrating the Registered Reports model into the grant application process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registered Reports pre-determine the research questions, methodology and design of a study to be carried out, and are designed to enhance the rigor, reproducibility and transparency of the science produced. CTF and PLOS ONE partnered together to review the 2017 DDIRR applications and granted three awards: Dr. Andrea McClatchey of Massachusetts General Hospital, Dr. Lei Xu of Massachusetts General Hospital, and Dr. Aaron Schindeler from the University of Sydney. The researchers also obtained an in-principle acceptance (IPA) to publication in the journal PLOS ONE. Provided the study is conducted according to plan, acceptance in principle is honored regardless of study outcome – thereby eliminating publication bias and maximizing the transparency of the funded work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reports are being placed on the Open Science Framework registered report portal (&lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/rr/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://osf.io/rr/&lt;/a&gt;), where authors will have the opportunity to make public or embargo their reports until publication of results. The awards have a duration of 12 months and will conclude in May 2019. As soon as results are added to the registered report, PLOS ONE will review compliance with the proposed protocol and publish their results, even if they are negative. By securing publication before they start their research, applicants can eliminate the bias of a result-based approach. The process was designed to maintain independence of funding and publishing decisions, while at the same time optimizing processes, thereby avoiding duplication and preventing research waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new award constitutes an evolution of the Drug Discovery Initiative (DDI) Awards that CTF had introduced in 2006 as a funding program for promising ideas that could lead to larger studies or move drugs into the clinic. Feedback on the new DDIRR program from both applicants and reviewers has been unanimously positive, and the Foundation together with PLOS ONE editors have also announced a new cycle for DDIRR in 2018-2019. The Foundation will invite applicants to submit their proposals starting on September 24, 2018, with the anticipated assignment of new awards in the first quarter of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The overall outcome of this first round of DDIRR has been very positive. Reviewers have focused their attention to protocols and study designs, allowing researchers to have their statistics ready for publication,” said Salvatore La Rosa, Ph.D., Vice President of Research and Development for the Children’s Tumor Foundation. “As this particular grant program focuses on hypothesis-testing research, the quality and rigor of the applications are critical to soundly move proof-of-concept experiments from the lab into the clinic. This new program increases our ability to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are delighted to continue our collaboration with CTF on the Registered Reports model for the DDI Awards. We hope this can serve as a model for other funders. The Registered Reports provide researchers with peer reviewed study designs and an in-principle acceptance of the completed study at PLOS ONE. The deposited reports at the Open Science Framework portal ensure full transparency of the research project – a win for everyone involved,” adds Joerg Heber, Editor-in-Chief of PLOS ONE.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/550863108/0/oupblogpsychology/"/>
		<id>https://blog.oup.com/?p=138474</id>
		<updated>2018-06-08T09:30:12+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;In the twentieth century, 40 to 60 million defenseless people were massacred in episodes of genocide. The 21st century is not faring much better, with mass murder ongoing e.g. in Myanmar and Syria. Many of these cases have been studied well, both in detailed case studies and in comparative perspectives, but studying mass murder is no picnic. Scholars have also examined how &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520089945&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;conducting research&lt;/a&gt;, including ethnographic fieldwork, archival investigation, and oral history interviews, can affect the researcher in profound ways. Among a broader set of difficulties that obstruct research on this wretched subject, two stand out in particular: political constraints and psychological attrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political constraints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All social research operates in a dense political field. Of all the political actors constraining research on mass murder, states stand out. They often have a vested interest in &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://books.google.nl/books?id=A0QlDwAAQBAJ&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;misrepresenting the truth&lt;/a&gt;, because for many, the memory of a genocide (or its denial), is part and parcel of their collective identity. States that consider themselves heirs to perpetrator regimes, such as Turkey, Russia, Indonesia, China, or Serbia, make great effort to influence the scholarship on episodes of mass violence. They deny access to archival collections and libraries, intimidate and prohibit them from conducting field work. (The opposite is also possible: governments may try to foster or manipulate research by funding politically useful research, by pushing for the establishment of academic chairs at home or abroad, or by offering scholarships.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having to contend with the taboos, restrictions, prescriptions, and outright threats of authoritarian regimes keeps scholars working on these topics under &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ssqu.2016.97.issue-4/issuetoc&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;permanent threat&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers bold enough to travel into these societies to visit sites, uncover evidence, interview witnesses, and have got to fear the security services and intelligence agencies of these states. One consequence of this discouraging atmosphere is that, in general, less research is carried out on those instances and episodes of mass murder, an undesirable blind spot due to the importance of the events. (Some researchers ingratiate themselves with the authorities for privileged access.) A second consequence poses a methodological dilemma: due to such constraints, does one launch a sting operation, like undercover journalism? Or does one use informants, fixers, and mediators on the ground? Does one pay the possible interviewees for taking the risks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt; We may not be willing or able to change our research topics, but we do need our colleagues and audience to be aware of these challenges. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychological consequences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are significant emotional consequences of studying mass murder. All social research also operates in a dense emotional and moral field. As a general problem in the academy, involvement and detachment has been dealt with at some length, but the study of mass violence is particularly relevant from this perspective. Though a certain amount of passion and involvement can facilitate one’s commitment to the topic, it requires a great deal of detachment to sift through documents and memoirs containing very intimate details of killing. Detachment is even more challenging in &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/14525.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ethnographic fieldwork and oral history interviews&lt;/a&gt;, as empathy can transmit to scholars the interviewees’ powerful negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis, I began interviewing Syrians about their experiences with violence, as part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://niod.nl/en/news/new-research-project-syrians%E2%80%99-experiences-mass-violence-and-dynamic-violent-conflict&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a large-scale oral history project&lt;/a&gt; we are launching in the Netherlands. Having interviewed about 80 survivors and eye witnesses so far, their emotions of anger, sadness, fear, survivor guilt, and anxiety has affected me irreversibly. These types of interviews can be an alienating and isolating experience: the more one is absorbed into the stories of the eye witnesses, the more one is also drawn into their emotions. As a general rule of thumb, I felt compassion when interviewing victims, and indignation when interviewing perpetrators. But the interviews left a mark long after I stopped recording. When one young woman from Aleppo told me that she was raped in an ambush and witnessed a beheading up close, I was aghast at that moment. Ever since, I have not mustered my courage to go over those particular interview transcripts and notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the risks of political threats and psychological attrition need to be taken seriously by academic institutions, journals, and colleagues. These constraints can produce setbacks and potentially lower productivity, even with &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2017/11/on-burnout-trauma-erin-jessee/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;appropriate self-care&lt;/a&gt;. We may not be willing or able to change our research topics, but we do need our colleagues and audience to be aware of these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;HIPAA Compliance Demonstrates Commitment by Science Exchange to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Protection and Privacy of Protected Health Information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PALO ALTO CA, June 7, 2018 –&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Science Exchange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; today announced that it is the first R&amp;amp;D outsourcing platform to achieve HIPAA compliance as required by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under 45 C.F.R. 164. This achievement demonstrates the company’s commitment to the protection and privacy of Protected Health Information (PHI) as defined by 45 CFR §160.103 and shared by its customers and scientific research providers on the Science Exchange platform. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; “Protecting sensitive patient health information is a top priority for our clients and research providers,” said Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Science Exchange. “Achieving HIPAA compliance was a crucial step for Science Exchange, given the increasing portability and complexity of data processed by our software platform.”  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HIPAA and HITECH: Noncompliance costing millions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act limit the disclosure of patient PHI, including data processed by any provider, technology platform, or other contractor. Since 2010, enforcement of HIPAA and HITECH has increased — with individual fines for noncompliance as high as $2 million. HIPAA compliance helps protect Science Exchange’s clients from these potential consequences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Science Exchange achieved HIPAA compliance by:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Establishing Business Associate Agreements for proper use and disclosure of PHI: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Business Associate Agreements are required agreements between covered entities and their business associates, such as Science Exchange, whose activities involve access to PHI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Implementing administrative, physical and technical safeguards against improper disclosures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Training every employee on protecting information subject to HIPAA and HIPAA requirements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Adopting best practices for limiting information use and sharing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Industry leaders in data privacy, security, and quality assurance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In addition to being the only HIPAA-compliant R&amp;amp;D outsourcing platform, Science Exchange is also the only outsourcing platform to have earned EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework certification. This certification ensures compliance with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/gdpr-plan&quot;&gt;General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulations&lt;/a&gt; that went into effect on May 25, 2018, thereby protecting the many R&amp;amp;D organizations that have enterprise-level agreements with Science Exchange. Science Exchange is also SOC 2-compliant and ISO 9001-certified.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/550638442/0/oupblogpsychology/"/>
		<id>https://blog.oup.com/?p=138297</id>
		<updated>2018-06-07T09:30:21+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Within its first month, the Trump administration revoked federal guidelines designed to promote protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or gender non-conforming youth (LGBTQ-GNC) public school students. This move received significant media attention, much of which focused on the challenges of growing up LGBTQ-GNC, and the unique role of schools as places that should be safe and supportive for all students. At issue is defining the rights of students to be protected based on LGBT-GNC identity or status. And yet these rights are regularly compromised through: harassment and victimization that is unchecked; unfair, punitive, and exclusionary discipline practices; and unequal access to supports, services, and curriculum that validate their identities and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking study, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/uslgbt/toc.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hatred in the Hallways&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;documented pervasive human rights violations perpetrated against LGBT youth in US schools. More recently, through an international convening and report, The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) firmly documented homophobic and transphobic violence as a global issue that has critical implications for positive development, health, and academic success of children and adolescence. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~en.unesco.org/themes/school-violence-and-bullying/homophobic-transphobic-violence&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UNESCO report&lt;/a&gt; argued that bullying generally, and bullying related to sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) specifically, comprise a threat to the universal right to education established in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations. This groundbreaking report provided a comprehensive review of the international literature on SOGI-related bullying in schools and documented the disproportionate rates of bullying for LGBTQ-GNC youth in countries on every continent across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these social and cultural norms and conventions impact the rights of all LGBTQ-GNC people, they are especially salient in relation to young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the landscape regarding human rights affordances, constraints, and abuses related to sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) is constantly in flux, any discussion of the SOGI rights of young people must take into account this larger global context. The rights of LGBTQ-GNC youth in countries where the expression of same-sex sexuality is criminalized are virtually non-existent; further, human rights violations against LGBTQ-GNC youth occur within most countries across the globe and are often justified by cultural and social norms and conventions regarding “acceptable or normal” definitions of sexuality and gender. While these social and cultural norms and conventions impact the rights of all LGBTQ-GNC people, they are especially salient in relation to young people. While several advances have been made in the last decade to advance the rights of LGBTQ-GNC people across the globe (for example see the 2006 Yogykarta Principles and the 2011 Human Rights Council’s resolution on LGBTQ-GNC rights) these documents rarely attend to specific SOGI rights of &lt;em&gt;young people&lt;/em&gt; or put forth any particular considerations regarding children and youth (a notable exception is in relation to access to education).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding intersecting forms of oppression—such as the ways that structural oppression related to gender and sexuality and its intersections with race, ethnicity, class, and religion affect young people, their parents, and educators in schools—is essential for designing and implementing effective processes, strategies, programs, and advocacy aimed at creating positive change within school contexts. Many of the SOGI-related inequities evidenced in schools can be traced, in part, to narrow definitions of masculinity and femininity, rigid frameworks regarding gender and gender roles, and hegemonic structures in schools that mark heterosexuality as not only compulsory but also the sole valid expression of sexuality. Other forms of structural oppression rooted in racism, religious, or social class bias, are intertwined with SOGI issues in schools through inequitable discipline practices, religious control of public education, or economic disparities across schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because SOGI issues in schools are embedded within larger systems of oppression, it is critical that research, practice, and policy engage with social justice and anti-oppressive education frameworks. Such approaches bring to the fore the ways that power, privilege, and bias structure schools in ways that tacitly sanction a range of educational inequities such as bullying, access to resources and services, and safety for young people in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity. As we continue to do this work, it has become increasingly evident that the SOGI safe schools movement is “inextricably linked” to broader education justice concerns. It is critical for the safe schools movement to work with others through intersectional, multi-issue coalitions—at the nexus of research, policy and practice—to ensure that all students’ educational rights, regardless of social position, are upheld. This type of cross-issue organizing, advocacy, and research takes time and needs to be grounded in the principals of the worth and dignity of all people, and that ensuring the rights of specific groups expands the rights of everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title type="html" xml:lang="en-US">Acupuncture and Pain</title>
		<link href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/06/05/acupuncture-and-pain/"/>
		<id>http://brainblogger.com/?p=23733</id>
		<updated>2018-06-05T14:30:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Acupuncture is one of the oldest systems of traditional medicine. With roots in China, this medical system is more than 2000 years old. It differs from various other medical systems as it does not involve taking any herbs or substances. Instead, it involves inserting small needles at specific predefined points. From the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century onwards, it has continued to gain prominence in the Western world, although many remain skeptical about efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, researchers want to know the exact mechanism of action of any medical system. They only trust the therapy if it has been proven as effective in randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials. Acupuncture has been the subject of many such trials, and its usefulness has been established in certain pain-associated conditions, mood disorders, and even in some diseases of internal organs. This led to the recognition of this medical system by many healthcare providers and medical organizations. In the US, acupuncture is recognized as complementary medicine. The WHO also recommends it for a number of specific medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical evidence of efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of clinical trials provide evidence of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/10/21/the-science-of-acupuncture/&quot;&gt;the effectiveness of acupuncture&lt;/a&gt; in various medical conditions. Among the most relevant trials are the so-called German mega-trials named ARC, ART, COMP, and GERAC. The primary focus of these trials has been pain relief in various musculoskeletal conditions. GERAC and ART were high quality random clinical trials investigating low back pain. These trials compared real acupuncture with sham acupuncture and standard care. Sham acupuncture involved needling without the use of conventional acupuncture points. Whereas standard care included the use of physiotherapy, exercise therapy, and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Results were measured after three months, and the response was defined as adequate if there was an improvement of more than 33% on the pain scale (the Von Korff Chronic Pain Grade Scale). After 6-months, the response rate with real acupuncture was 47.6%, while it was 44.2% with sham acupuncture, and 27.4% with standard care. Though these trials clearly demonstrated the efficacy of acupuncture, they also showed &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2008/07/29/there-is-no-sham-in-acupuncture/&quot;&gt;the effectiveness of sham acupuncture&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers think that this phenomenon is linked to psychogenic factors involved with back pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, similar results were also demonstrated in various trials in the US. Though these trials show the usefulness of acupuncture in painful conditions, they also illustrate the value of psychogenic factors. Therefore, it is not surprising that acupuncture had also proven its utility in treating mood disorders and sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chinese medicine, the use of acupuncture is not limited to pain-related conditions. Thus, there is need for more extensive trials across a diverse range of diseases. The existing data do indicate that acupuncture may be an alternative approach for many difficult to treat chronic ailments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the areas of debate regarding acupuncture has been the difficulty in explaining its mechanism of action. As per traditional explanation, acupuncture is used to correct the flow of energy (Qi) in the body. This life energy flows through the fixed paths or highways in our body called &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2009/02/03/a-primer-on-acupuncture/&quot;&gt;meridians&lt;/a&gt;. Practitioners of acupuncture believe that in disease conditions there is a blockade of energy highways or meridians. Acupuncture is about creating the balance between the internal forces called Yin and Yang. However, the trouble is that modern science is not able to demonstrate or even understand the concepts of Qi, Yin, Yang, and Meridians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few decades, practitioners of modern science have made various attempts to explain the mechanism of action of acupuncture, and they came up with multiple theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measurable effects of acupuncture&lt;/strong&gt;: One of the explanations is that needling does cause local changes and alterations in reflexes. It also has systemic effects, as it changes the working of the autonomous nervous system. Thus, acupuncture affects blood pressure, heart rate, levels of various hormones, and changes the levels of neurotransmitters. All of this results in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/01/mind-over-matter-mindfulness-meditation-for-pain-management/&quot;&gt;pain relief&lt;/a&gt; and other beneficial effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local mechanotransduction&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a theory promoted by a French physician in 1961, who wrote that acupuncture points have lower local resistance when compared to surrounding skin. He wrote that while normal dry skin has a resistance of 200,000 to 2 million Ohms, acupuncture points have a resistance of just 50,000 Ohms. The believers in this theory say that acupuncture causes minute traumas at the points of needle insertion and thus stimulates survival mechanisms of the body. Needling stimulates homeostasis, anti-inflammatory responses, tissue regeneration, and much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurohumoral theory&lt;/strong&gt;: it has been demonstrated that acupuncture is useful in pain relief, and naloxone blocks its analgesic effect. Thus, researchers propose that needling at specific points leads to the release of endogenous painkilling &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/03/why-sugar-is-so-addictive/&quot;&gt;opiate-like substances&lt;/a&gt; such as enkephalins, endorphins, dynorphins and some other neurotransmitters like serotonin and noradrenaline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gate-control theory&lt;/strong&gt;: This theory states that needling stimulates large myelinated nerve fibers. These fibers carry tingling sensations and feelings of warmth, and can inhibit the painful sensation that is transmitted to the brain by much smaller C-fibers via spinal tracts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postsynaptic inhibition&lt;/strong&gt;: This is another explanation, which states that acupuncture results in the inhibition of pain through a central mechanism via disinhibition of RAF. This phenomenon typically works in cases of extreme trauma like loss of limb. This central mechanism has a role in protecting the body from extreme stress and pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomous nervous system&lt;/strong&gt;: Proponents of this theory suggest that acupuncture works by changing the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morphogenetic singularity theory&lt;/strong&gt;: This is one of the more complicated hypotheses that tries to explain the existence of meridians. Advocates of this theory explain the presence of non-neural communication pathways in the body. During embryonic development, when neurons are not yet formed, cells must communicate among themselves to direct development. Meridians are just the remains of these early communication paths, which are still present in the adult body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualization&lt;/strong&gt;: In recent years, fMRI methods have advanced a lot, and in many clinical studies it has been demonstrated that stimulation of various acupuncture points by needling results in activation of different brain centers, thus explaining the mechanism of action of acupuncture. It is believed that both the elements of morphogenetic singularity theory (meridians) and components of the neurohumoral response are involved in the stimulation of the brain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is obvious that various theories have been used to describe the mechanism of action of acupuncture, and most probably there is more than one mechanism is involved. Clinical trials do seem to indicate that acupuncture is beneficial in specific health conditions. But the way it works still remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/HI-034040-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now know that it is something in the farming environment that makes the salmon there have many spots, but we have yet to find out exactly how the spots are triggered. It could be anything from the lighting regime, temperature, diet, to the fish density or growth rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether a specific breed of domesticated salmon had different numbers of spots depending on whether it had been hatched in a river or lived on a salmon farm its entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We planted domesticated salmon into the Guddal river, Norway, where it hatched and stayed for 2-4 years before we took the salmon out of the river as smolts (juveniles) and moved it to our research station at Matre. After spending two years in land based tanks there, these salmon were still seven times less spotty than domesticated salmon that had lived its entire life at Matre under standard farming conditions, even though the salmon were the same breed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10234&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-10234&quot; height=&quot;302&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/Fig-spots-1024x483.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Photographed by Monica F Solberg and edited by Katarina Jørgensen&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both domesticated and wild salmon growing up in a farm environment had many spots, while all the salmon, both domesticated and wild, that were reared in the river had few spots. This means that we can be certain that it’s the environment that decides how many spots a salmon gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we also identified a region on salmon chromosome, a quantitative trait locus (QTL), containing genes linked to the degree of spottiness. So, genetics does play a role, but it is small compared to the effect of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the wild salmon and the domesticated salmon from the Guddal river had few spots even though these salmon lived for two years in land based tanks at the research station at Matre. This indicates that the spots were established on the salmon before it was removed from the river at smolting. That the salmon receive their distinguishing marks before they have time to escape is a useful observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many spots are nevertheless a safe indicator of an escaped farmed salmon if you catch one in a river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleaning rivers of escaped farmed salmon currently happens based on visible traits such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://lakselva.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Salmopedia-h%C3%A5ndbok.pdf&quot;&gt;body shape, the wear of fins and spots&lt;/a&gt;. If farmed salmon survive for long in nature, they start to resemble wild salmon. Spots on salmon have been shown in &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jfb.13491&quot;&gt;several studies&lt;/a&gt; to be stable over time, so they probably don’t disappear upon escaping, although this is not what we have tested here. Many spots are nevertheless a safe indicator of an escaped farmed salmon if you catch one in a river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, experiments in Zebrafish show that when their stripes are disrupted experimentally they grow back in a way that is consistent with Alan Turing’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/329/5999/1616&quot;&gt;theory of how biological patterns form&lt;/a&gt;. Turing patterns are known for allowing the environment to influence the pattern in ways which create individuality in each one – &lt;a href=&quot;https://tbiomed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-4682-8-24&quot;&gt;like in human fingerprints&lt;/a&gt;. Finding environmentally determined patterns in a well characterized species like Atlantic salmon points to new opportunities for studying biological pattern formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuality of patterns together with &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jfb.13491&quot;&gt;spot stability over time&lt;/a&gt; also suggests that spot patterns could be used for identifying individual fish using video surveillance, which may be used to monitor the environment in both fish farms and rivers.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fastest-Path-banner.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fastest Path banner&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1353&quot; height=&quot;133&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fastest-Path-banner-300x66.png&quot; width=&quot;605&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Chandreyee Das, Ph.D., Science Exchange, b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;ased on an interview with Mareb Hamed, (MBChB, MSc, PhD), University of Mosul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Scientific research is challenging enough. But for Dr. Mareb Hamed, geopolitical upheaval in her home country of Iraq threatened not only her research, but also her survival.&lt;a href=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Flag-map_of_Iraq.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-1349 alignright&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Flag-map_of_Iraq-300x300.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr. Hamed’s story, and how Science Exchange became a part of that story, inspires our team to keep doing what we do — helping scientists connect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400; color: #338dc8;&quot;&gt;Studying Growth-Restricted Fetuses in War-Torn Iraq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Mareb Hamed graduated at the top of her class from the Medical University in Mosul, Iraq, a city which was, at its peak, a cultural and educational center. In the 1990s, the political situation worsened under the regime of Saddam Hussein, and Dr. Hamed and her husband left Iraq and moved to Libya. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;When war started in Libya, Dr. Hamed returned to Iraq but could not re-obtain her former position of assistant professor, much to her frustration.“So I enrolled in the PhD program,” she explained, “in order to advance my career and because I liked research.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr. Hamed began her research project in 2014, investigating the effect of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) on placental biomarkers. IUGR can be caused by multiple factors and is a leading cause of neonatal deaths. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400; color: #338dc8;&quot;&gt;From Researcher to Refugee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr. Hamed had collected a number of placenta samples from local hospitals when the Arabs entered Mosul, killing or forcing the departure of countless scientists, engineers, doctors, lawyers, journalists, and other professionals.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“I became a refugee in Erbil city,” recounted Dr. Hamed. “I lost everything. My house, my car..even the placenta samples that I was collecting.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“But I knew I had to complete my PhD — I knew I had to start over and complete my research. So I continued my research at the University of Erbil, renting a small condo so that I could start working.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400; color: #338dc8;&quot;&gt;Erbil to St. Louis: Science Exchange Opens Gateway to Collaboration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;At the University of Kurdistan in Erbil, Dr. Hamed started collecting placentas again, and she was able to complete the histology and the immunohistochemistry on these samples. But the remaining analysis, which required electron microscopy, proved very difficult and cost-prohibitive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“I started searching on the internet,” she continued, “and I found Science Exchange, and through Science Exchange, a provider who could do the microscopy for me.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr. Hamed started sending her placenta capsule samples through DHL to the provider, an academic core laboratory at Washington University in St. Louis. The provider lab did the sectioning and the staining, and started sending Dr. Hamed the images by email. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“The microscopy images they sent me were very nice,” said Dr. Hamed. “Even during the defense of my thesis, I was told, “You have very nice pictures.”  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #338dc8;&quot;&gt;The Surprise, and the Legacy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Mareb-Acknowledgment.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Mareb Acknowledgment&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-1351 alignright&quot; height=&quot;262&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Mareb-Acknowledgment-300x262.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“Then, I got a surprise,” said Dr. Hamed, “and I am very grateful to Washington University for this. When I told the lab my story, about how I was a refugee from Mosul, and how they had taken everything, they performed the service without requiring any payment. They did not take even one dollar from me! Only I have paid the cost of sending the samples by DHL.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr. Hamed successfully defended her thesis, in which she acknowledged Science Exchange and her collaborators in St. Louis. She has since gone on to continue her research in Mosul and also provide medical assistance and training to other dislocated and disadvantaged Iraqis — showing that the power of scientific connections goes far beyond an electron microscope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

With a stunning view of the Swiss Alps, the congress commenced with a musical interlude by members of the youthful local string ensemble &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cellobass.ch/Cellobass/PRJOJEKT.html&quot;&gt;CELLOBASS&lt;/a&gt;, followed by a welcome from the President of the Swiss Science Foundation, and the Mayor of the City of Bern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time for celebration!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s congress was marked by a double celebration, namely the 30th anniversary of the European Association for Palliative Care, as well as the commemoration of the 100th birthday of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cicelysaundersinternational.org/dame-cicely-saunders/&quot;&gt;Dame Cicely Saunders&lt;/a&gt;, widely regarded as the founder of palliative care as we know it today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cicely trained as a nurse, social worker and physician, dedicating her work to pain and symptom relief through holistic care that not only addresses the physical needs of patients, but also meets the social, psychosocial and spiritual needs of patients, family and carers. She was involved in the foundation and running of the world’s first purpose-build hospice St. Christopher’s Hospice in London, as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cicelysaundersinternational.org/&quot;&gt;Cicely Saunders Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a charitable organisation which promotes research to improve care and treatment for all patients with progressive illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot topics in palliative (s)care research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference was broadly divided into three major topics: cancer and palliative care, public health and policy, and ageing and palliative care. Furthermore, the first day saw a special Swiss session, which discussed controversial topics such as the wish to die and hastening of death, voluntary stopping of eating and drinking, and continuous deep sedation, as well as topics on palliative care services in Switzerland and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free standing sessions were also held, addressing various topics including family carers, palliative care in diverse chronic illnesses, advance care planning, education research, and research methods discussions. However, two themes emerged in talks across all sections: 1. the increasing requirements of palliative care needs worldwide, and 2. the recommendation to integrate palliative care alongside clinical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term palliative care has become an unspeakable metaphor for one’s own death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter topic was addressed in two talks by the winner of this year’s Clinical Impact Award &lt;a href=&quot;https://medicine.duke.edu/faculty/thomas-william-leblanc-md&quot;&gt;Thomas LeBlanc MD&lt;/a&gt;, who discussed his own work on integrating palliative care in the clinical treatment of patients suffering from haemato-oncological diseases. His slip of the tongue “Palliative Scare” was an unintended example of how the service is often feared by medical professionals and patients as an end-of-the-line treatment. This thought was also emphasized by Early Researcher Award winner &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thegroundswellproject.com/anna-collins/&quot;&gt;Anna Collins&lt;/a&gt;, who stated that the term palliative care has become an unspeakable metaphor for one’s own death, and discussed the communication between patients and doctors about death, dying and the introduction of palliative care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These and other discussions at EAPC2018 indicated that integrating palliative care in the treatment of terminal (cancer) patients at an earlier stage helps relieve unaddressed symptoms, lessens psychosocial distress, and improves overall quality of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Palliative care for the many and the few&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several talks at EAPC2018 addressed the specialist palliative care needs and requirements for minority groups. The variety in minority groups resulted in diverse topics discussing different aspects and needs of palliative care, including the spiritual needs of religious people in secular countries, and the cultural and linguistic barriers between carers and patients of different ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children form another minority group in palliative care, and their specialized needs can sometimes be overlooked by palliative care researchers and carers. In an excellent talk by Post Doctoral Award winner &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.york.ac.uk/healthsciences/our-staff/lorna-fraser/&quot;&gt;Lorna Fraser&lt;/a&gt;, various data sets were linked to provide a better insight in the access to palliative care for children and young adults with progressive or terminal disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal favorite was an insightful talk by Mary Turner on palliative care for dying prisoners, and in particular the difficulties faced by prison officers responsible for their care. The shortage of palliative carers in UK prisons means that most palliative support is provided by prison officers who are not trained to deal with the psychological aftermath of caring for the terminally ill. Furthermore, the facilities in UK prisons often do not allow for the installments of hospital beds, wheelchairs may not fit through doors, and palliative care resources are lacking. The lack of time, resources, and training relating to palliative care for dying inmates contributes to the general stress and job-related ill health of prison officers across the UK, and a poor quality of life for dying inmates. An open meeting to discuss a taskforce for care provision for prisoners in Europe was also part of the EAPC2018 program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal reflections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10222&quot; style=&quot;width: 322px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10222&quot; height=&quot;208&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/hospice-1821429_960_720-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;312&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EAPC2018 was a very interesting conference that covered a wide range of thought-provoking, and sometimes controversial topics, and I would certainly recommend this congress to anyone with interest in the field. I would like to congratulate &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpalliatcare.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Palliative Care&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Associate Editor &lt;a href=&quot;https://research4kids.ucalgary.ca/profiles/shane-sinclair&quot;&gt;Shane Sinclair&lt;/a&gt; for receiving the Paper of the Year Award, and I would like to commend the organisers for handing out sturdy, reusable plastic cups, which greatly reduced the amount of plastic waste that I have experienced at other conferences. I am certainly looking forward to the 11th World Research Congress of the EAPC in Palermo, Italy!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/argonne/4534362371&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-5529&quot; height=&quot;665&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/4534362371_3da9090e51_b-1024x680.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Photo by George Joch / courtesy Argonne National Laboratory.&quot; width=&quot;1002&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an excerpt from the Introduction to &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/book/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Women’s Brain Book. The neuroscience of health, hormones and happiness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade writing about brain science, I’ve developed a tried and tested method for researching an unfamiliar topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I’ll read the appropriate chapter in &lt;em&gt;Principles of Neural Science,&lt;/em&gt; the neuro-bible beloved by brain geeks the world over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I’ll run a quick search on PubMed, an online search engine of biomedical literature, to find a recent review of the topic, typically written by a top scientist in the particular field, which will give me a feel for the topic’s controversies and consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I’ll feel confident enough to read and understand original research papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’ll seek out the experts themselves – the scientists, doctors and specialists, who, despite their busy schedules, usually give generously of their time to answer my questions and fill in the gaps of my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, describing the neurobiology of women’s everyday lives hasn’t always been as straightforward as I expected when I began writing my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My meander through the world of women’s health often left me bewildered. Time and time again I’d open the textbooks or scan the literature to find scant research on some of the questions I’d been most curious about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I assumed the literature would be replete with information on how the oral contraceptive pill affects women’s brains. A 2014 review summed up the current state of affairs with the title &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4139599/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;50 Years of Hormonal Contraception. Time to Find Out What It Does to the Brain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Quite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I proudly announced to Facebook the day I finally dived into the neurobiology of multiple orgasms. But it was not a deep dive. PubMed spat out only five literature reviews, three of which were devoted to the possibility of multiple orgasms in men. One was amusingly titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2050052115000542&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multiple Orgasms in Men. What We Know So Far&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (FYI: Orgasms don’t rate a mention in neuroscience textbooks and we don’t know much so far about women’s orgasm either).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my best efforts, I was unable to pin down the statistics for how many women suffer emotional turmoil in the days leading up to their period, aka premenstrual syndrome (PMS). I eventually narrowed the range down to somewhere between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3972521/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;twelve &lt;/a&gt;per cent and ninety per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was positive I’d be able to tell my mid-life readers whether or HRT would help protect against dementia or clear away their brain fog. Oestrogen protects the ageing brain, but we simply don’t have enough information about the benefits for brain health for any recommendations to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is the literature so sparse when it comes to neurobiology and women’s health?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, preclinical research (research conducted on lab animals such as rats, mice or monkeys) has mostly been conducted on male animals. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3008499/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2009 survey&lt;/a&gt; of over 2000 animal studies found a significant male bias in eight out of ten biological disciplines. The bias was most pronounced in the field of neuroscience where five and a half males were studied for every one female. Worryingly, pharmacology (the study of drugs) shares similar statistics, with five males studied to every one female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical research (investigations conducted on humans) hasn’t fared much better. There are a few large, all-female projects such as the Women’s Health Study which I’ll discuss in later chapters, but for many years women were excluded from clinical studies and drug trials altogether. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4714546/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one critic notes&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many medical professionals can attest to the fact that for decades, the default human model subject was a 70-kg male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is alarming because diagnoses for anxiety and depression are more than twice as common in women than in men, women have more strokes than men, twice as many women suffer from multiple sclerosis, and women have a higher susceptibility to adverse drug reactions compared with men. Indeed, between 1997 and 2000, eight out of ten drugs withdrawn from the USA market were, in part, due to more severe adverse effects in women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cumulative effect of excluding women from research studies, or assuming that biologically women are ‘little men’, is destructive. As has been pointed out in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20535186&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, medical care as it is currently applied to women is less evidence-based or ‘robust’ than that being applied to men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d be tempted to believe the straightforward sexism permeates the hallowed halls and ivory towers as readily as other global institutions. It does, but sexism isn’t the only reason for lack of gender equality. There are some legitimate reasons to skew the ratios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason is safety because if women fall pregnant during a drug trial there is the potential for harming the unborn baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason is that females – both animals and humans – complicate data gathering. Our cyclical reproductive hormones, especially during the fertile years between puberty and menopause, make our biology intrinsically more fickle than males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The menstrual cycle was once&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=cahill+L+2017++an+issue&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; likened&lt;/a&gt; to “a pesky sort of feature essentially of the female, an unnecessary source of additional variability and one wisest to avoid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further complicate matters, in humans, biological sex (anatomy and physiology) and gender (characteristics that a society or culture defines as masculine or feminine) are tightly entwined and hard to tease apart. It’s extraordinarily difficult to make statements such as, ‘It’s due to her hormones’, or ‘It’s all to do with cultural expectations’. Rather than tackle the intricacies of female sex and gender, female hormones and culture, researchers often choose the easier route of focussing on males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, research on sex and gender has been for a long time been almost taboo. This is especially so in the neurosciences where many researchers were deeply concerned that their findings could be hijacked to support outdated and inaccurate stereotypes and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fears are not unfounded. Women’s brains have historically been found wanting or biologically inferior compared to males, and such &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/how-neurosexism-is-holding-back-gender-equality-and-science-itself-67597&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has been co-opted to “keep women in their place”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One neuroscientist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=cahill+L+2017++an+issue&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…exploring sex differences was once “a terrific way for a brain scientist not studying reproductive functions to lose credibility at best and, at worst, become a pariah in the eyes of the neuroscience mainstream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to another who said she once believed including sex as a biological variable was ‘lazy’. This was before she came to the conclusion that studying the impact of a woman’s menstrual cycle on the brain might add a valuable dimension to her research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the research community is taking steps to address the dearth of neurobiological research in women, and in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hachette.com.au/dr-sarah-mckay/female-brain-book&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Women’s Brain Book&lt;/a&gt; you’ll meet some of the researchers at the forefront of the movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States and academic publications such as the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience Research&lt;/em&gt; now mandate the inclusion of sex as a biological variable in all research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) clearly states the research into the health of women and girls is a particular priority. Here in Australia, we have the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health, a survey of the physical, mental and psychosocial health of over 58,000 women across their lifespan. Finally, there are some fabulous research initiatives such as Stanford University’s Gendered Innovations project that exist to ‘harness the creative power of sex and gender analysis for innovation and discovery’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an excerpt from the Introduction to The Women’s Brain Book. The neuroscience of health, hormones and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

 As everyone knows, Roseanne Barr posted a racist tweet. She claimed that the sleeping medication Ambien affected her behavior, but her show got cancelled anyway.



Now, I think this scandal raises some surprisingly interesting philosophical questions about moral responsibility and the nature of self-control. What follows is a dialogue between two hypothetical speakers exploring some of these questions. To be clear, this is a post about philosophy, not about Roseanne. I don't know or care if</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/06/DepressionImaging_larger-1-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression can have a profound impact on affected individuals and those around them. It is one of the most common mental health conditions, and its symptoms include sustained feeling of sadness, hopelessness, and guilt. In severe cases, these symptoms may be aggravated by suicidal thoughts, or even attempts. The odds of experiencing a depressive episode are relatively high: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-244X-9-19&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;at least&lt;/a&gt; one in &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/196765&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;six&lt;/a&gt; individuals will experience an episode in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the term &lt;em&gt;depression&lt;/em&gt; suggests that it represents a single psychiatric condition, patients vary tremendously in their symptoms, risk factors, and response to available treatment. Risk factors include not only genetic variations and hormonal changes, but also destructive thinking patterns, or stressful and traumatising experiences. Current treatments primarily include medication and psychotherapy. Medication prescribed in depression targets different brain chemical systems, involving neurotransmitters that include serotonin and dopamine. These are involved in communication between nerve cells and, more generally, in the feeling of well-being. Psychotherapy aims to help patients develop effective coping strategies to use when they are faced with challenges and setbacks. Most depressed individuals will eventually recover – however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.2006.163.11.1905&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;up to one third&lt;/a&gt; may not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One branch of depression research focuses on finding biomarkers that can identify individuals that will most likely benefit from a specific therapy. The field also works on developing innovative treatments. However, both goals require a better understanding of the underlying biology. Brain imaging research, clinical psychology, and genetics have provided some fascinating answers, but have also posed new challenging questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We asked three experts and pioneers in depression research: &lt;em&gt;How do you study clinical depression, what role does brain imaging play in your research, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;and what challenges lie ahead for the field? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.stanford.edu/group/mood/cgi-bin/wordpress/?p=243&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ian H. Gotlib&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Professor of Psychology, Department of Psychology, Stanford University):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Over the past two decades, we have learned that depression is a heterogeneous disorder, with wide variations in symptom presentation, age of onset, number and duration of episodes, and causal factors. In my lab, we take this heterogeneity seriously – we administer structured diagnostic interviews to every participant in our studies. And perhaps more important, we conduct multimodal assessments of depression – we examine &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-02062-y&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brain structure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, function, and connectivity; endocrine function, both under acute stress and throughout the day; cognitive functioning, including biases in attention, interpretation, and memory; and digital phenotyping of depressed children, adolescents, and adults. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The number of brain imaging studies has grown exponentially, and there is now a burgeoning literature examining brain structure, function, and connectivity in depressed individuals. Neuroimaging studies have helped to elucidate the neural circuitry involved in reward processing and the processing of emotional experiences. Because the two cardinal symptoms of depression in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) involve the persistent experience of negative affect and anhedonia, researchers studying depression have focused on examining their neural underpinnings. From these investigations we are learning about anomalous neural characteristics of depressed individuals that may be related to difficulties in daily functioning and that may serve as intervention targets. We know far less, however, about aspects of brain structure, function, and connectivity that place individuals at risk for developing depression, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2675295?redirect=true&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;that keep high-risk persons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; from experiencing depression, and that influence the maintenance of and recovery from this disorder. We also know relatively little about the developmental trajectories of these anomalous neural characteristics, knowledge that is critical in understanding differences between children and adults in the presentation of depression.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/helen-s-mayberg&quot;&gt;Helen Mayberg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Professor of Neurology, Neurosurgery, Psychiatry and Neuroscience, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Our lab takes a circuit approach to the study of major depression&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Studies integrate &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;multimodal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; neuroimaging strategies and quantitative behavioral and psychophysiological metrics within experimental clinical trial protocols to define brain mechanisms &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;mediat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; anti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;–&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;depre&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;sant treatments. The overarching goal is to develop imaging biomarkers and algorithms that will &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;identify&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; patient subgroups and optimize treatment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;individual patients. This work &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;serves as a basis for ongoing testing and refinement of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4413475/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deep brain stimulation (DBS)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;of the subcallosal cingulate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a technique that our lab is investigating&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; for treatment resistant depression. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imaging has provided new perspectives on understanding the pathogenesis of depression, as well as treatment mechanisms. Studies have systematically defined a core set of consistent regional abnormalities, correlations between symptoms and abnormal function of specific brain regions, and evidence of putative depression subtypes. Multimodal imaging and advanced analytic methods have further provided strategies to build depression circuit models that directly test &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4336918/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;treatment selection biomarkers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The challenge for the ‘field’ will be to define what method(s) are ‘good enough’ to warrant meaningful replication studies of an encouraging finding. Balancing a useful clinical biomarker that might improve treatment selection or response assessment from those addressing fundamental mechanisms of circuit dysfunction and pathophysiology require different strategies and standards.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://psych.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/lindend.php&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David EJ Linden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Professor of Translational Neuroscience, Cardiff University and Maastricht University):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;One of the main research techniques used in my group is real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback training. fMRI allows researchers to trace activation patterns that are associated with external stimuli or internal mental states in real time, and we can feed these activation changes back to patients, so they can learn to regulate them themselves. This opens up interesting potential therapeutic avenues, for example, for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24733975&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;emotion regulation training in depression&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, but also &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.braintrainproject.eu/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;other mental disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Functional brain mapping with fMRI has provided crucial new insights in the neural representations of affect and its disturbances. It has become clear that there are strong links between classical emotion and motivation areas, implemented through functional anatomical links between the limbic system and the basal ganglia, for example, in the ventral striatum. This has sparked renewed interest in the role of reward mechanisms in depression. A future challenge will be to work on the standardisation of imaging protocols across sites and conduct formal studies of the potential diagnostic and predictive value of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;these functional imaging patterns in order to produce clinically useful biomarkers.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers and clinicians agree that depression can manifest differently in each individual. Neuroimaging and multimodal studies allow investigators to examine underlying mechanisms of such variability, although &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2579940&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;identifying robust biomarkers&lt;/a&gt; remains challenging. This knowledge informs translational research into new brain circuit-based interventions, including clinical trials of DBS and neurofeedback treatment.  Thereby, the field may “close the loop,” yielding more effective and individually tailored treatments for depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that some of us experience “&lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-5/feeling-fraud&quot;&gt;imposter syndrome&lt;/a&gt;” was first mooted in the 1970s by two US clinical psychologists who noticed the preponderance of high-achieving women who felt they had somehow cheated or fluked their way to success and feared being found out. Research on the syndrome has since exploded and it’s become clear that many men also experience similar fraudulent feelings. In fact, in their new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886918302435&quot;&gt;exploratory paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/em&gt;, a team of US and German researchers claim that, under pressure, imposter syndrome may hit men harder than women, triggering more anxiety and worse performance – a difference they speculate may be due to traditional gender norms that place a greater expectation on men to be competent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34000&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Badawy and her colleagues recruited hundreds of female and male undergrads studying communication or business in northeastern USA. They measured their levels of imposter syndrome with an established scale that includes items like “Sometimes I’m afraid others will discover how much knowledge or ability I really lack”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one study, the researchers gave the students two sets of five verbal and numerical Graduate Record Exam questions (the GRE is used in the US to select students for graduate programmes). After the first set of questions, the researchers ramped up the pressure for half the students, giving them fake feedback that stated they had answered all of the first five questions incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although imposter feelings were overall higher among women, this harsh feedback seemed to especially affect male students with high imposter feelings – they reported higher anxiety, made less effort (as measured by time taken on the task), and showed a trend towards poorer performance, as compared to others given positive feedback. In contrast, female students with high imposter feelings responded to harsh feedback by increasing their effort and showing superior performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was similar in a second study in which heightened pressure was placed on half the students by telling them that their results on five Graduate Record Exam questions would be shown to a professor on their course (the researchers called this a “high accountability” situation). In this context, men with higher imposter syndrome scores again showed increased anxiety, reduced effort and a tendency toward worse performance, as compared with others who were told their scores would be shown anonymously to a stranger. In contrast, women with imposter feelings were largely unaffected (in terms of anxiety, effort or performance) by the increased accountability situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase in anxiety, and reduction in effort, shown by men with imposter feelings could be interpreted as reflecting their fear of being found out, combined with a “self-handicapping” strategy – reducing their effort so that they can use this as an excuse to explain the poor performance that they are anticipating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Assuming that traditional gender norms hold, males [with imposter syndrome] may have exhibited  stronger negative reactions because they believe that society at large values males who demonstrate high competence and at the same time, do not believe that they can fulfil this standard,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the women with imposter feelings appeared less sensitive to the negative feedback and expectation of review by a professor – if anything, they arguably responded to negative feedback in an adaptive way by increasing their effort. The researchers linked this with the traditional cultural expectation that women should be warm rather than competent.  “Being less constrained by gender norm violations and backlash (i.e. they were already expected to perform poorly on competence-based tasks like exam questions), females [with imposter feelings] may have felt freer to attempt to improve their performance (and risk failure) rather than excusing it with lack of time or effort invested,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to know if and how these findings might relate to real-world situations in an  academic setting or workplace. Badawy and her team admit their findings are exploratory and may not generalise. In particular, if their explanation based around gender norms is accurate, one can imagine these norms might vary not just across international cultures, but even between different sub-cultures in the same country – depending, for instance, on the specific gender-based attitudes, beliefs and pressures in different occupations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These issues aside, Badawy and her colleagues suggest their key finding – of particular male vulnerability to imposter syndrome under pressure – may have practical implications for managers. “If managers of organisational specialists observe evidence of imposter syndrome in male workers currently performing at high levels, they may benefit from making attempts to restore those workers’ sense of agency if they are placed under high accountability situations,” they said. They added that mentoring by professors or managers, skills training and stretch assignments could be potential beneficial strategies (find &lt;a href=&quot;https://99u.adobe.com/articles/54774/how-to-beat-the-imposter-syndrome-feeling&quot;&gt;more ways to combat imposter syndrome in this 99U article&lt;/a&gt;). However, they warned these will only work “if mentors are trained to down regulate their own gender role expectations”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average young adult sends more than 100 texts per day, mainly to offer social support to friends and family. But until now, there has been little evidence whether it helps the recipient or not. New &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563218300918&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Computers in Human Behavior&lt;/i&gt; confirms that sending a comforting text to a partner confronted with a difficult task really can make them feel supported. But more surprisingly, the study suggests that to actually reduce their stress, it’s better to send a message that isn’t explicitly supportive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34002&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Hooker and colleagues from the University of California asked 75 women to attempt a stressful set of tasks involving mental mathematics and public speaking. At the start of the experiment they were fitted with a blood pressure cuff to capture information about blood flow and heart rate. While waiting to perform, some participants received texts from their romantic partner who was waiting in the other room. Crucially, some of the partners sent texts (scripted by the researchers) that were comforting (e.g. “Don’t worry. It’s just a psych study. You’ll be fine.”) whereas others sent more mundane texts that were not explicitly supportive (e.g. “It’s cold in here.”). Participants also received a second reinforcing text with the same tone as the first (i.e. either supportive or mundane) while they prepared for their challenge (other participants acted as a baseline control group and received no texts at any point).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After delivering the task, participants who’d earlier received a comforting text reported feeling more supported by their partner (compared with the controls). However, it was only those participants who’d earlier received mundane texts who showed a physical reduction in their stress response, as shown by lower systolic blood pressure during preparation and the task itself.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that attempts to support other people that give the impression of social evaluation – “I can see that you’re struggling” – are ineffective at reducing stress, and Hooker’s team conjecture that the supportive texts, by making direct references to the stressful tasks, may have inadvertently triggered this effect, although this was not explicitly tested for in the study. If so, it adds to research suggesting that “invisible” support – like offering unrelated humour – can be one of the more effective forms of reducing stress through social support. In this case, simply the reminder that the boyfriend was next door, grumbling about the cold, affirmed that the person was not alone, and could receive comfort or validation should that be needed (e.g. if the stressful event went badly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding certainly needs follow-up research to figure out what are the ingredients in different forms of text-based social contact to affect how we feel. It’s worth noting that the effect of the mundane messages also involved a slower recovery to blood pressure baseline than the supportive text or the control condition. So it may be that different kinds of messages can have selective effects on different phases of the stress response. Studies have begun to show downsides of heavy texting use, such as school performance and sleep, although in many cases these may be confounded by use of mobile phones in general. It’s useful, then, to see evidence of something many of us assume and hope for – that contact with loved ones via text can provide them with a sense of being supported during stressful events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563218300918&quot;&gt;It just takes a text: Partner text messages can reduce cardiovascular responses to stress in females&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/05/Ebola_Blogs_690x320-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early sharing and expedited peer review of relevant research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the ongoing Ebola &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/ebola/en/&quot;&gt;outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; we are creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/ebola&quot;&gt;PLOS Channel for Ebola Research&lt;/a&gt;.  The Channel will make it easy for researchers to keep up with developments and important research related to the outbreak. We will work with authors and our editorial boards to provide rapid review and facilitate the responsible dissemination of preprints. We believe these responses are urgently needed during serious and rapidly developing threats to public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All relevant articles published across PLOS will be included in the Ebola Channel, alongside major contributions curated from the broader literature. You can also send any questions or content recommendations to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:ebola@plos.org&quot;&gt;ebola@plos.org&lt;/a&gt; or tweet us @PLOSChannels using the hashtag #PLOSEbola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I make my Ebola research available quickly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve created a taskforce to identify editors and reviewers, and to manage an expedited review process across all our journals and platforms.  For authors, we recommend the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to share a single observation (no more than 1 figure or table with commentary) submit to PLOS Currents: Outbreaks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Submit any other research to one of the 7 PLOS journals; all Ebola-related submissions will be prioritized. (Note that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/fee-assistance#loc-fee-assistance-programs&quot;&gt;fee waiver assistance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; is available as needed)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share your data and manuscript ahead of submission: large datasets should be deposited in a relevant repository, and manuscripts submitted to a preprint server. Include the DOIs or accession numbers for datasets and preprint in your submission. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to expediting research publications, PLOS believes all data on the Ebola outbreak should be shared as rapidly and openly as possible. We endorse the Wellcome Trust’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/our-work/sharing-research-findings-and-data-relevant-ebola-outbreak-drc&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/a&gt;demanding availability of data and research on Ebola. Editorial consideration of research submissions to PLOS journals will not be prejudiced by the early sharing of data or preprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons learned: delivering rapid responses to emergency outbreaks &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS saw surges in submissions in previous outbreaks, notably the Ebola outbreak of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2014/09/05/plos-resources-ebola/&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt; and the Zika outbreak of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2016/01/07/will-zika-become-the-2016-ntd-of-the-year/&quot;&gt;2015/2016&lt;/a&gt;. In each emergency, we provided resources to serve the community. In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/data-sharing-make-outbreak-research-open-access-1.16966&quot;&gt;concerns&lt;/a&gt; about data sharing during the 2014 Ebola outbreak led PLOS and other journal editors to issue a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/medicines/ebola-treatment/blueprint_phe_data-share-results/en/&quot;&gt;joint statement&lt;/a&gt; encouraging early data sharing. A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002549&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt; showed that, while increased use of preprints in the 2016 Zika outbreak accelerated the dissemination of research results, the proportion of published articles on Zika that were preceded by preprints remained low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our shared responsibility in public health emergencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe research, healthcare, and publishing communities have a responsibility to work together to respond rapidly to public health emergencies. PLOS is committed to disseminating new research findings as efficiently and effectively as possible. We appreciate the opportunity to facilitate access to your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Applications are invited for a PhD studentship on Computational frameworks for
high-dimensional neural data with Dr. Shabnam Kadir in the Biocomputation
Research Group in the Centre for Computer Science and Informatics Research,
University of Hertfordshire, U.K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New developments in experimental technology have led to petabytes of raw data
being produced by experimental neuroscientists, which are increasingly publicly
available, e.g. Allen Institute data (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.brain-map.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.brain-map.org/&lt;/a&gt;). In particular,
we are in the realm where population recordings of tens of thousands of neurons
are feasible thanks to, e.g. a new generation of large dense probes for
electrophysiological recordings, imaging using 2-photon microscopy coupled with
calcium fluorescent sensors. Large scale neuronal recordings require novel
approaches for both processing and quantitative analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as using techniques from high-dimensional statistics, machine learning,
information theory, we aim to explore new approaches from mathematical fields
outside statistics, such as algebraic topology. The study of networks is a
particularly important topic in neuroscience: neurons communicate with each
other electrically via synapses, forming intricate networks. These networks can
be studied using techniques from computational topology (e.g. persistent
homology, clique topology). These could be used to extract information about
subnetworks and assemblies, both from large scale recordings, and via
connectomics derived from simulations (Blue Brain Project).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aim in this project to go beyond spike sorting and develop new tools and
computational frameworks which would help interpret high dimensional data and
interrogate how information is being processed by the brain, e.g.  How are
sensory stimuli (location in environment, visual and auditory stimuli) encoded?
How can we characterise the neural activity associated with memory, attention,
decision making and motor control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shall be collaborating with labs at Imperial, Pennsylvania State University
and UCL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information can be found here:

&lt;p&gt;We are looking for candidates with the following profile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong first degree in a quantitative field such as mathematics, physics,
computer science, engineering, computational neuroscience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong programming skills (e.g. Python, MATLAB, C++).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest in neuroscience and biology would be helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A studentship from the PhD Programme in Computer Science provides approximately
£14,750 per annum bursary plus the payment of student fees. Applicants from
outside the UK or EU are eligible.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avid photographers celebrate the viewfinder as a means of helping us see the world anew. But psychology research has shown that under some conditions taking a photo of something actually makes it harder to remember. One possible reason is that we give less attention to an experience when we know that it will be safely stored in a photograph. But in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211368117301687&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition&lt;/i&gt;, Julia Soares and Benjamin Storm from the University of California show that the photo-taker’s memory will suffer whether they expect to keep the photo or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33997&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work aimed to replicate and extend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24311477&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; by Linda Henkel that showed that taking photos of paintings in a museum could lead to poorer recall of those paintings. To make sense of this, Henkel drew on the body of research on&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/29/remembering-together-how-long-term-couples-develop-interconnected-memory-systems/&quot;&gt; transactive memory&lt;/a&gt;, which shows that longtime partners or friends distribute memory demands between them, creating a “shared” system where one will remember certain things so the other doesn’t need to. Henkel thought that in a similar fashion we may be treating the camera as a memory partner and offloading the effort onto it. Soares and Storm tested this explanation by separating photo taking from photo having.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main experiment was a computerised version of Henkel’s museum task. Around 50 undergraduates viewed paintings one at a time onscreen. In one block, participants took a photo of each painting with a smartphone, and then had 15 seconds to look at the painting itself. In a second experimental block, the participants took a photo of each painting, deleted the photo immediately (so they knew it could never been accessed in the future), then had 15 seconds to look at the painting. Finally, in another experimental block, they took no photos and simply viewed each painting for 15 seconds.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a ten minute delay (during which phones were confiscated) came a multiple- choice memory test probing what the participants remembered about the various paintings. Compared to paintings that were simply viewed, performance was poorer for paintings that were photographed. Critically, this was true both for the condition where the photo was stored, and for the condition where it was deleted, meaning the participant knew they could not rely on it as a future memory partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that offloading may not be the cause of the memory disadvantage associated with taking photos. One alternative explanation is that using a camera forces us to disengage from properly taking in the stimulus, as our attention flows to the mechanics of operating buttons, checking brightness, exposure etc. This is something commonly reported by people as part of their photo-taking experience, and also tallies with the fact that automatic wearable cameras that store images for later don’t produce the memory impairment. However, in the current experiment, after taking pictures (or not), every participant had the same amount of time to take in the paintings without use of equipment, so any distraction effect would need to include some sort of delayed effect on memory processing even after the act of taking a photo was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soares and Storm have a speculative second interpretation. They suggest that the effort involved in taking a photo – getting the framing right, ensuring the lens is in focus – leads to the sense that you’ve done a good job of encoding the object itself, even though you have been focusing more on peripheral features. So you’re not mentally slacking-off because you think the camera has it covered – but because you think you already have. It may be relevant that people who take photographs at events &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/25/taking-photos-will-boost-your-enjoyment-of-experiences-researchers-say/&quot;&gt;report afterwards&lt;/a&gt; feeling more immersed in the experience, which would tally more with this explanation than the disengagement-due-to-fiddling idea. In any case this is further evidence that those of us who approach exciting life events through the lenses of our electronic devices may be distancing ourselves from fuller participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211368117301687&quot;&gt;Forget in a Flash: A Further Investigation of the Photo-Taking-Impairment Effect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Estimating the distance of a gas source is important in many applications of chemical sensing, like e.g. environmental monitoring, or chemically-guided robot navigation. If an estimation of the gas concentration at the source is available, source proximity can be estimated from the time-averaged gas concentration at the sensing site. However, in turbulent environments, where fast concentration fluctuations dominate, comparably long measurements are required to obtain a reliable estimate. A lesser known feature that correlates with source proximity in a turbulent environment is the temporal variance of local gas concentration: Gas encounters become more intermittent farther from the source. However, is has commonly been assumed that exploiting this feature requires gas concentration measurements at the millisecond scale, usually requiring expensive photo-ionisation detectors. We have recently shown that, with appropriate signal processing, off-the-shelf metal-oxide sensors are capable of extracting rapidly fluctuating features of gas plumes that strongly correlate with source distance [1]. We present a straightforward analysis method to decode events of large, consistent changes in the measured signal, which we denote ‘bouts’. The frequency of these bouts predicted the distance of a gas source in wind-tunnel experiments with good accuracy. In addition, we found that the variance of bout counts indicates cross-wind offset to the centre- line of the gas plume. Our results offer an alternative approach to estimating gas source proximity that is largely independent of gas concentration, using off-the-shelf metal-oxide sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know someone who is convinced their opinion is better than everyone else’s on a topic – perhaps, even, that it is the only correct opinion to have. Maybe, on some topics, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; are that person. No psychologist would be surprised that people who are convinced their beliefs are superior think they are better informed than others, but this fact leads to a follow on question: are people &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; better informed on the topics for which they are convinced their opinion is superior? This is what Michael Hall and Kaitlin Raimi set out to check in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311730714X&quot;&gt;a series of experiments&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33991&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers distinguish “belief superiority” from “belief confidence” (thinking your opinion is correct). Belief superiority is relative – it is when you think your opinion is more correct than other people’s; the top end of their belief superiority scale is to indicate that your belief is “Totally correct (mine is the only correct view)”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair set out to find people who felt their beliefs on a variety of controversial political issues (things like terrorism and civil liberties, or wealth redistribution) were superior, and to check – using multiple choice quizzes – how well they were informed on the topics about which they held these superiority beliefs.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across five studies Hall and Raimi found that those people with the highest belief superiority also tended to have the largest gap between their perceived and actual knowledge – the belief superior consistently suffered from the illusion that they were better informed than they were. As you might expect, those with the lowest belief superiority tended to underestimate how much they knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as simple background knowledge, the researchers were also interested in how people with belief superiority sought out new information relevant to that belief. They gave participants a selection of news headlines and asked them to select which articles they’d like to read in full at the end of the experiment. Categorising headlines as belief-congruent or belief incongruent, the researchers observed that those participants with higher belief-superiority were more likely to select belief congruent headlines. In other words, despite being badly informed compared to their self-perception, these participants chose to neglect sources of information that would enhance their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally and more promisingly, the researchers found some evidence that belief superiority can be dented by feedback. If participants were told that people with beliefs like theirs tended to score poorly on topic knowledge, or if they were directly told that their score on the topic knowledge quiz was low, this not only reduced their belief superiority, it also caused them to seek out the kind of challenging information they had previously neglected in the headlines task (though the evidence for this behavioural effect was mixed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies all involved participants accessed via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, allowing the researchers to work with large samples of Americans for each experiment. Their findings mirror the well-known &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect&quot;&gt;Dunning-Kruger effect&lt;/a&gt; – Kruger and Dunning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10626367%20&quot;&gt;showed that&lt;/a&gt; for domains such as judgements of grammar, humour or logic, the most skilled tend to underestimate their ability, while the least skilled overestimate it. Hall and Raimi’s research extends this to the realm of political opinions (where objective assessment of correctness is not available), showing that the belief your opinion is better than other people’s tends to be associated with overestimation of your relevant knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the research presents a mixed picture. It shows, as others have, that our opinions are often not as justified as we believe – even for the opinions that we are most confident are better than other people’s. On the other hand, it shows that people are responsive to feedback, and aren’t solely driven by confirmation bias when they seek out new information. The final picture is of human rationality that is flawed, but correctable, not doomed.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311730714X&quot;&gt;Is belief superiority justified by superior knowledge?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 In 2017, the great London university UCL invited an external expert commission to investigate its role into the deadly trachea transplants performed by the former UCL honorary professor and scandal surgeon Paolo Macchiarini. An already sacked UCL nanotechnology professor, Alexander Seifalian, whose lab made the two UCL plastic POSS-PCU tracheas in 2011, was announced as … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://forbetterscience.com/2018/05/31/ucl-trachea-transplant-inquiry-scapegoating-obfuscation-and-a-lost-nose/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;UCL trachea transplant inquiry: scapegoating, obfuscation and a lost nose&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;meta-nav&quot;&gt;→&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>
