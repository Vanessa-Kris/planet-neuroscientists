&lt;p&gt;Pharmacelera is a Computer-Aided Drug Design company developing disruptive computational chemistry solutions to find candidate molecules with more considerable chemical diversity. Pharmacelera’s solutions are based on more than 20 years of research in academia and use accurate 3D molecular descriptors that combine hydrophobic, electrostatic and steric interaction fields derived from semi-empirical quantum-mechanical (QM) computations. This allows screening libraries containing millions of compounds and finds new diverse chemical structures which show similar physicochemical properties to known leads. Such diversity is especially valuable when finding new intellectual property, generating backup compounds, translating natural product into a proper small molecule or overcoming pharmacological limitations of the molecular candidates.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/Untitled-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is generally assumed that exaggerated signals in birds, for example brilliant colors, evolve through the relationship between the females and males, where the sexual form changes throughout time to counteract the opposing sex’s traits. These signals serve to attract a suitable mate, and sexual selection allows for the more desirable traits to continually pass down through the species. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying these signals are not well known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10204&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10204 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/Balearica_pavonina-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Black crowned crane – By Michael Möller (nopics.de) via Wikimedia Commons&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the paper ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-018-1136-y&quot;&gt;Evolution of &lt;em&gt;CYP2J19,&lt;/em&gt; a gene involved in color vision and red coloration in birds: positive selection in the face of conservation and pleiotropy&lt;/a&gt;’, Twyman, Andersson and Mundy investigate the ‘redness gene’. This recently identified gene encodes an enzyme which can modify carotenoids, a class of pigments which produce red, orange and yellow hues. More specifically, the researchers investigated whether the &lt;em&gt;CYP2J19&lt;/em&gt; gene is present in all birds, its copy number in different avian lineages, its pattern of selection across avian genomes, and whether &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;selection changed after the gene was diverted to serve two functions, vision and color, in weaverbirds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10205&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10205&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/RedcrestedTuraco-300x240.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Red-crested turaco – By Daniel Demczuk, from Wikimedia Commons &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined 70 avian genomes, representing all major avian clades. Of these 70 genomes, a single full-length &lt;em&gt;CYP2J19&lt;/em&gt; (the redness gene) was retrieved from 43 of them. Sequences of the redness gene in 13 species of weaverbirds were also analysed, 7 of which contain the carotenoid-modifying enzyme. They found that this gene has been positively selected throughout the rapid diversification of birds, though the cause of this is unclear. Positive selection was found to be common in this gene family in birds, and no evidence was found for a change in selection pressure in the redness gene following a shift in function for red coloration in weaverbirds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results obtained in this study were found to be consistent with the ancestral conserved function of the redness gene in providing colour vision and the red colouration of the skin and its appendages. A single copy of the gene was identified in a phylogenetically broad range of avian lineages, indicating that a single &lt;em&gt;CYP2J19&lt;/em&gt; gene is the &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;ancestral avian state. Red retinal oil droplets are present in almost all birds, yet red colouration is patchy amongst species. This indicates that the colour vision contribution of the &lt;em&gt;CYP2J19&lt;/em&gt; gene is likely its ancestral and widely preserved function. Red colouration appears to have been independently developed along particular bird lineages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10206&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10206&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/800px-Birkhahn-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Black grouse – Vnp [GFDL (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html), via Wikimedia Commons&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It’s 9 AM Monday morning. You’ve just pulled into work and are ready to pitch your presentation to the senior management team. Your PowerPoint slides are damn near perfect and you’ve gone over the script dozens of times. You’ve got this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As everyone gathers in the room, you’re suddenly flooded with a hit of adrenaline. The bad kind. In a flash you become acutely aware of what your body is doing: beads of sweat forming on your brow, a dry mouth that no amount of water can fix, and a steadily increasing heart rate thumping inside your chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ability to perceive the signals of your body is known as &lt;em&gt;interoceptive accuracy &lt;/em&gt;(IAc). There are, as the example demonstrated, different psychosomatic cues that you pick up within yourself during states of anxiety. But above all, a beating heart is the hardest one to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s for this reason that &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/02/does-our-heartbeat-influence-our-sensory-awareness/&quot;&gt;heartbeat perception&lt;/a&gt;, as brain scientists call it, is a direct proxy for measuring people’s IAc and reported anxiety and stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IAc and a beating heart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the ability to accurately detect your own heartbeat is critical for reappraising your anxiety on a moment to moment basis. We know that anxiety is as much in the body as it is in the mind, and that a (mis)perception of a fast heart rate can easily contribute to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2007/04/13/do-you-have-panic-attacks/&quot;&gt;catastrophization of a panicked state&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s why some of the most effective anxiety-related therapies, like progressive muscle relaxation and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/01/mind-over-matter-mindfulness-meditation-for-pain-management/&quot;&gt;deep breathing&lt;/a&gt;, tend to focus on muting a physiological response followed by a cognitive reappraisal technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in terms of IAc, the longstanding view was that it is an inherited trait, similar to eye color or height. Your IAc is immutable, unchanging. But now there’s new evidence suggesting that the situation matters just as much as the person: While some people may have inherently bad interoceptive ability, we can’t ignore the influence of the broader context. And this, if it turns out to be true, is a definite win for anyone looking to reverse a certain anxiety-based predisposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study and findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers led by Martin F. Whittkamp out of the University of Luxembourg  set out to investigate just how much of a role the environment plays in determining our ability to self-reflect on accurate &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/27/neurofeedback-therapy-for-the-management-of-pain/&quot;&gt;biofeedback&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers relied on two methods to measure IAc via heartbeat perception. The first, called the counting task is simply a comparison between actual measures of your heartbeat with your self-reported measures. Another method, called the heartbeat discrimination task, measures how accurately you can rate whether or not your heartbeat is in sync with an external stimulus such as a blinking light on a computer screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team in this newest study compared the results of both a heartbeat counting task and discrimination task in two conditions: a resting state and a stress state. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2018/04/09/the-effects-facebook-breaks-and-on-stress-and-well-being/&quot;&gt;Mental stress&lt;/a&gt; was induced by having participants match the color of a flashing light bulb with a corresponding button as fast and accurately as possible. If this wasn’t stressful enough, the experimenter also chimed in with a few verbal cues urging the participant to perform better so as to not ruin the entire experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to comparing stress state IAc with resting state IAc, the researchers also designed a number of computational models. These models aimed to measure how much of one’s interoceptive accuracy is owed to individual ability versus the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results found that about 40% of a person’s IAc can be explained by his/her individual traits, while around 30% can be explained by the changing situation, leaving the remaining 30% to measurement error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this says is that your ability to detect and therefore modulate your bodily responses during an anxious state is not fixed. These signals are amenable to change. You can learn to more accurately perceive your beating heart in a high-stress environment. You can apply reappraisal techniques in mitigating your &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/20/neurological-basis-of-anxiety/&quot;&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study have the potential to inform research on stress and anxiety management. For example, having a general idea of how much your IAc is dependent on biological predisposition could provide leeway to pharmaceutical interventions to help combat debilitating responses to stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now there’s therapeutic power in knowing you can improve your IAc and work towards minimizing your anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychotherapists are devoted to improving people’s psychological health, but sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/03/10/how-often-does-psychotherapy-make-people-feel-worse/&quot;&gt;their efforts fail&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10503307.2018.1453621&quot;&gt;new qualitative study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychotherapy Research&lt;/i&gt; delves into what therapists take away from these unsuccessful experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrzej Werbart led the Stockholm University research team that focused on eight therapy cases where the clients – all women under the age of 26 – had experienced no improvement, or in three cases, had deteriorated. This was based on comparing their pre- and post-therapy symptom levels following one to two sessions per week of psychoanalytically-focused therapy for about two years, to deal with symptoms such as depressed mood, anxiety, or low self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33965&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seven therapists responsible for these cases (one had two non-improving clients) were also all women, average age 53, with a range of experience in therapy.  Each had had success in leading other clients to improvement, which is typical; the evidence shows even strong therapists have cases that fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapists took part in interviews at the start and end of treatment using the Private Theories Interview – a way of exploring the therapist’s take on the case, how they are approaching it, and (retrospectively) what could have been handled differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Werbart’s team used the grounded theory tradition to look for emerging patterns in the interviews and found a paradoxical picture. On the one hand, the therapists talked of the great first impressions they’d formed of these cases; they had a clear sense of empathy with the clients’ plight, and engaged with their interesting stories or quick wits. They also said they had felt a connection, even admiration; these were special cases, and the therapist was motivated to do right by them. They also reported that the clients seemed to be attracted to the process, at least on the surface, finding it intellectually stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the therapists also reported that from the very beginning there was a sense the clients were somehow removed. This was the first inkling of what Werbart’s team found to be a key theme, of “having half of the patient in therapy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially the therapists said they were optimistic that this was a solvable challenge, but as the sessions continued, it became a mire. Whenever the therapists attempted to address what a client was not disclosing, the client would typically pull back – by intellectualising around issues, or holding back revelations until the session was nearly over. Later, some clients became impersonal in manner and treated the therapist as just a part of the furniture, or they cancelled sessions entirely. The therapists described how trying more actively to wrest back control led to “fruitless battles”, and the process terminated with the therapist in an emotional state, overwhelmed by the client’s energy. One therapist reported “I felt I was drawn into some damned depth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Werbart’s team speculate that the paradoxical elements – high initial promise and enthusiasm followed by the later sense of distance – may form two parts of a whole, the case of a therapist “one-sidedly [allying] herself with the patient’s more capable and seemingly well-functioning parts.” These clients are clearly sharp, and may have developed shiny, effective defence mechanisms that took the therapist in. Evidence shows that therapists who initially underestimate the degree of the client’s problems are more likely to struggle, and that successful outcomes begin with a good reading of the situation, not sceptical, but not credulous either. Regarding the current cases, the therapists may have been beguiled by their client’s charisma, and were on the back foot when they belatedly began to dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite acknowledging the lack of improvement in their clients, the therapists maintained that the therapy they’d offered had been useful – that their clients had grown in self-awareness, laying groundwork for improvement, if only there were more time. While this interpretation can’t be ruled out, the therapists’ insistence on it may reflect a reluctance to acknowledge their being taken in by their clients’ defences. This is perhaps because being a therapist – especially in ultimately successful therapy – is associated with unpleasant feelings, as progress means getting into hard and upsetting issues. A rare case that generates strong feelings of engagement, connection and excitement – even in the absence of tangible improvements – may feel like a welcome change, and it may be hard to acknowledge that the such situations are not cause for celebration, but for caution.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/this-is-your-brain-on-junk-food-according-to-a-neuroscientist-part-6/"/>
		<id>http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/?p=5518</id>
		<updated>2018-05-25T00:32:11+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-5519 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2681667053_e5439c9d6c_z.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We know high fat and high sugar “junk” foods are bad for our health, but we often sneak them into our diets. Sometimes it just feels like our brain wants us to eat a bar of chocolate or scoff down a whole pizza.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neuroscientists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://amyreichelt.com/&quot;&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; have been studying the effects of these foods on the brain, which helps us to understand how diets can affect brain function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is Part 6 and the final of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/category/gut-brain-axis/&quot;&gt;series on the gut-brain axis&lt;/a&gt;, diet and brain health. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Your brain loves junk foods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brains are hardwired to make you want to engage in the behaviours you find pleasurable – like having sex, socialising and eating tasty foods – all vital for the survival of a species. When you eat tasty junk foods your brain’s reward system (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/mesolimbic-pathway&quot;&gt;mesolimbic dopamine system&lt;/a&gt;) activates and releases the neurotransmitter &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/dopamine-cause-digital-addiction/&quot;&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the brain &lt;em&gt;adapts&lt;/em&gt; when we eat lots of rewarding foods and responds by making more receptors for dopamine. The simplest way to think of the interaction between dopamine (or any neurotransmitter) and its receptor is to think of a lock and key where the receptor is the lock and the neurotransmitter is the key. Turning the key sparks a neural impulse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we make more dopamine receptors, we need to eat more of the reward (junk foods) to get the same ‘goooooood’ feeling, similar to how addicts can develop a tolerance to drugs. The brain wants us to eat tasty foods and then it wants more, and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Junk foods grab our attention and make us impulsive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our attention is drawn towards what feels good, and in a world full of junk foods it can be difficult to resist sweet temptations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain’s decision-making centre – the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/prefrontal-cortex&quot;&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; – controls our behaviour. Eating excess junk foods can &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180510&quot;&gt;impair prefrontal cortex function&lt;/a&gt;. This can lead to impulsive behaviours and poor decision making – like eating a whole box of cookies instead of cooking a healthy meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fighting these temptations is difficult when faced with the strategic placement of sweet treats by supermarket checkouts, chocolate muffins in your local coffee shop, or bold adverts for fast food. All of these prompts trigger us to want these foods and can be hard to resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Junk foods can impair your memory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high levels of refined sugars and saturated fats in junk foods leads to a state of inflammation in the brain that damages brain cells (neurons). Rats that gorged themselves on a diet of sugary drinks, cakes and cookies for just five days had signs of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26970578&quot;&gt;inflammation in the hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; and struggled with memory tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-happens-in-the-hippocampus-32589&quot;&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; is the brain’s memory centre and is vital for remembering new information. Neurons in the hippocampus form connections that are constantly being reorganised, a process we call &lt;em&gt;neuroplasticity&lt;/em&gt;. This enables us to learn and form memories in response to the constant influx of information in our dynamic world. Junk food filled diets also reduces key brain chemicals required for neuroplasticity, impairing memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research also shows that people who eat lots of junk food also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22023100&quot;&gt;perform badly in memory tests&lt;/a&gt; compared to those who eat healthily, irrespective of body weight (i.e. you don’t have to be overweight for these foods to impact your brain’s health).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But it’s not all bad news…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding how junk foods can impact your brain, it one simple steps to modify your lifestyles to reduce their negative effects. It is important to be aware of what is in the foods we eat, particularly when pre-packaged foods are marketed as ‘healthy’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercising and eating healthily are vital for keeping both our body and brains in good shape. I hope you read my previous blog about foods that can boost your brain’s performance…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way parents and teachers praise children is known to influence not only their future performance, but how they feel about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/09/18/seven-year-olds-beliefs-about-ability-are-associated-with-the-way-they-were-praised-as-toddlers/&quot;&gt;malleability of intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. If a child has done well, focusing positive comments on their efforts, actions and strategies (saying, for example, “good job” or “you must have tried really hard”) is preferable to saying “you’re so smart”, in part because process-centred praise is thought to encourage kids to interpret setbacks as opportunities to grow, rather than as threats to their self-concept. In contrast, a kid who’s led to believe she succeeds because she’s “intelligent” may not attempt a difficult challenge, in case she fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now – and somewhat remarkably, given all the praise and growth mindset research conducted on children – a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00221325.2018.1441801&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, led by Rachael Reavis at Earlham College, Indiana, US, published the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Genetic Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, claims to be the first to test the effects of different types of praise on how adults feel after failure.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33947&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 156 adults via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk website. After completing a set of six easy visual pattern problems, which they were given up to two minutes to solve, they were all informed: “You did better than the majority of adults!” But then the feedback varied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a third were told that, based on the pattern of their results, they had been classified as “in the high intelligence group” (person-focused ability feedback); about a third were told they had been classified as “the kind of person who works hard” (person-focused effort feedback – they were a “hard worker”) and about a third were told they had been classified as “working hard on these questions” (process-focused effort feedback – they had worked hard).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All participants were then given a set of 12 difficult problems (which timed out after 3.5 minutes), and no matter how well they did, all were told that their performance was “worse than most adults”. The researchers were interested in how the earlier feedback would affect the participants’ performance and enjoyment on the tasks, and especially how they would interpret their apparent failure at the final set of difficult problems.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based partly on previous findings involving children, the researchers expected that being told you’re a “hard worker” would be the most beneficial kind of praise or feedback, as it implies that the person typically puts in a lot of effort. (And while this form of praise is person-centred, it focuses on behaviour, rather than on intrinsic ability.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the type of feedback participants received after the easy task did not affect their performance on the difficult problems, relative to their performance on the first. Meanwhile, it was the “hard worker” group who said they enjoyed the difficult set of problems &lt;em&gt;the least&lt;/em&gt; (the other two groups did not differ from each other on this); they also believed they had been less successful on the tasks than those in the other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, when the participants indicated, on a scale of 0 to 10, to what extent they attributed their poor performance at the final task to lack of effort or to lack of intelligence (as well as to eight other factors that were included to obscure the true purpose of the study), there were no group differences for effort, but as expected, those in the “worked hard” group were significantly less likely to attribute their failure to their level of intelligence than those in the “high intelligence group”. However, against expectations, the “hard worker” group actually blamed their low intelligence just as much as the “high intelligence” participants.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researchers note, “Few of the results demonstrated with children were replicated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why might this be?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that adults believe that telling someone they’re a hard worker is something positive to say when you can’t plausibly say that they’re smart or gifted. When I think back to my own childhood, there were awards at school for “good work” and also for “hard work”, and, among the kids, a “good work” award was seen as being the bigger achievement. In contrast, at my children’s primary school, in the light of the findings on process-focused praise, rewards are focused entirely on effort. However, it’s also standard for a child who typically puts in a lot of effort to be called a “hard worker”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For children today, this may perhaps still be beneficial. For adults, who grew up in a different time, “being told one is a ‘hard worker’ may elicit feelings of inadequacy, which undermine positive perceptions of the task,” the researchers write. “Future work should investigate how both children and adults interpret these types of praise.”&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h4&gt;Researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience discovered a new way that the protein RGS14 functions as a molecular brake on learning and memory&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain has an incredible capacity to support a lifetime of learning and memory. Each new experience fundamentally alters the connections between cells in the brain called synapses. To accommodate synaptic alterations, certain areas of the brain are highly plastic, meaning that have the ability to adapt to incoming information. Within an important brain structure for memory, the hippocampus, reside some of the most plastic cells in the entire brain, utilizing the process of synaptic plasticity to remain primed and flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestled between the highly plastic CA1 and CA3 regions, the rather inflexible neurons of area CA2 do not readily undergo synaptic plasticity, sharply contrasting the functional properties of its close neighbors. Once underappreciated, the CA2 region is now understood to be important for social, spatial, and temporal aspects of memory as well as the target of caffeine’s cognitive boosting effects. Determining the unique factors that confer this unique resistivity to plasticity could provide vital insights into the neural basis of learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignright imgCaption margin20right&quot; id=&quot;attachment_5698&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Figure-2-EurekAlert.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-5698&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Figure-2-EurekAlert.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Signaling diagram of a CA2 dendritic spine from a RGS14 KO mouse depicting mechanistic targets of the pharmacological inhibitors of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent signaling pathways investigated in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determined to elucidate this mystery of plasticity, researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) in collaboration with researchers at Emory University and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, have for the first time identified a novel role for the CA2-enriched protein RGS14 and provided insights into the mechanism by which it limits plasticity. Paul Evans, Ph.D., a Post-doctoral Researcher in Ryohei Yasuda’s Lab, and collaborators, published a study in May 2018 in the journal eNeuro that links RGS14’s ability to curb plasticity to calcium regulation. RGS14, a specialized scaffolding protein, contains an amalgam of unique domains. Previous proteomics work by Evans and colleagues exploring these domains, established two new RGS14 interacting partners: CaMKII, a calcium signaling protein and Calmodulin, a calcium binding protein and crucial calcium regulator. To initiate the signaling cascade of synaptic plasticity in CA1 neurons, the influx of calcium into the cell is required to drive the activity of CaMKII and Calmodulin. Due to this relationship, RGS14 is poised to act as a calcium modulator, gating plasticity in CA2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To verify this proposed relationship, Evans and collaborators probed in greater detail the masked form of plasticity, called Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), that is awoken in CA2 neurons when RGS14 is removed. Notably, mice lacking RGS14 display both enhanced learning in addition to robust CA2 synaptic plasticity, on par with levels reported in CA1. To ascertain if this latent CA2 plasticity is similar to the calcium-driven mechanisms of CA1, the team employed precise pharmacological inhibitors targeting critical calcium signaling molecules in mice lacking RGS14. Strikingly, the inhibitors abolished the newly unveiled LTP in CA2 neurons lacking RGS14, demonstrating the necessity of calcium signaling in CA2 and revealing similarities to the mechanisms that underlie plasticity in CA1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirming calcium signaling as a critical component of quiescent plasticity in CA2, Evans next investigated calcium influx in small neuronal compartments called dendritic spines during LTP in CA2 neurons from mice containing and lacking RGS14. Calcium transients in spines from mice containing RGS14 were significantly smaller than those in mice lacking RGS14, indicating that RGS14 plays an important role in adjusting calcium levels in CA2 neurons. Furthermore, the acute overexpression of RGS14 in CA2 neurons lacking the protein once again abolished plasticity and significantly reduced plasticity when expressed in the CA1 region. Increasing extracellular calcium levels reversed the abolition of plasticity, reinforcing the notion that RGS14 exerts its plasticity restricting properties through the regulation of calcium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RGS14 seems to be special, acting as a molecular factor that puts the brakes on plasticity when it’s present, enabling specialized types of memory encoding. Establishing a greater understanding of the molecular makeup conferring subtle differences between brain regions, like those seen in CA1 and CA2, will allow us to better understand the mechanisms that underlie learning and memory,” notes Dr. Evans.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Although early experiences are important for personal development and future life, as adults we recall nothing or very little of those early formative events, such as making first steps or &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2018/02/14/why-children-learn-foreign-languages-easily/&quot;&gt;learning first words&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, when adults are asked about their first memories they usually don’t recall events before the age of 2-3, with only fragmented recollection of events that happened between the age of 3 and 7. This phenomenon is often called childhood or infantile amnesia. It represents an inability of both children and adults to recall episodic memories (i.e., memories for particular events or stimuli that occur in a particular context) from infancy and early childhood, before the age 2-4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigmund Freud was the first researcher to develop the theory of infantile amnesia, as he had observed that his patients rarely had been able to recall memories of events that took place during the first years of life. He believed that &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/08/25/repressed-memories-fact-or-fiction/&quot;&gt;childhood memories are being repressed&lt;/a&gt; and thus forgotten. Still, modern theories focus on cognitive and social development as an important predictor of childhood amnesia. One possible explanation of childhood amnesia is the lack of neurological development, i.e., the development of brain parts that are in charge of storage and retrieval of episodic memories. For instance, some researchers believe that the development and functioning of the prefrontal cortex (cortex area at the front of the brain) is crucial for the creation of contextualized memories. Moreover, the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are assumed to be crucial for the development of autobiographical memories. Importantly, these two brain structures develop around the age of 3 or 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of neurological maturation, i.e., maturation of brain structures required for creation, storage, and recall of memories during infancy and early childhood might explain the phenomenon of childhood amnesia. According to this explanation, childhood amnesia occurs not due to the loss of memories over time (&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/04/20/deliberately-forgetting-memories-easy-for-some/&quot;&gt;the forgetting explanation&lt;/a&gt;), as Freud had suggested, but rather due to the lack of storing of these memories in the first place. The lack of stored memories, according to this theory, is due to brain immaturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some evidence has suggested that amnesia for events taking place in early childhood (before the age of 2) could be at least partly explained by difficulties with verbally recalling memories that were encoded before language acquisition. In line with this is the fact that the majority of words (the vocabulary) are acquired between the age of 2 years and 6 months and 4 years and 6 months. This is the time period that the earliest memories can be recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Childhood amnesia seems not to be an exclusively human phenomenon. Indeed, some researchers have observed something like infantile amnesia in animals (for instance, rodents). The discovery of amnesia in animals has pointed to the possibility of investigating the underlying mechanisms of childhood amnesia, such as neurological events, by using animal models. The animal studies have addressed the importance of some parts of brain and their development in relation to the childhood amnesia. For instance, they have indicated that high rate of neurogenesis in hippocampus as observed in infancy might explain the accelerated forgetting of contextual fear memories. It seems that integrating of new neurons into the existing circuit might destabilize and weaken the existing memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some researchers believe that it is unclear whether childhood amnesia occurs due to the failure of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/04/how-do-we-improve-our-working-memory/&quot;&gt;memory retrieval&lt;/a&gt; or failure of their storage. Forgetting might be described as a linear function of the time passing since the event. Since there is a long time span between the early events and recall in adulthood, it might be assumed that early events are simply forgotten. Still, some researchers disagree. This is because they have found that subjects recall far less memories for events occurring between the age of 6 and 7 as would be expected by simply extrapolating the forgetting curve. Thus, forgetting could not completely explain the phenomenon of childhood amnesia. This is why a neurogenic hypothesis of childhood amnesia has been developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to its inventors, a neurogenic hypothesis explains childhood amnesia through the continuous adding of new neurons (neurogenesis) in the hippocampus, as already mentioned above. According to this hypothesis, high levels of postnatal neurogenesis (which occurs in both humans and some animals) in the hippocampus prevents the creation of long-lasting memories. This hypothesis has been experimentally tested in animal models (mouse and rat). The findings emerging from these models have proposed that high levels of neurogenesis jeopardize the formation of long-term memories, possibly by replacement of synapses in pre-existing memory circuits. In addition, the same findings indicate that the decline in hippocampal neurogenesis corresponds with the emerging ability to form stabile memories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, according to these animal studies, the theory of neurogenesis appears to be a logical explanation for childhood amnesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the early theory regarding the forgetting or repressing of memories might look like a good explanation of childhood amnesia, more recent findings demonstrate that something else is happening in our brain that contributes to this phenomenon. Whether this is the lack of development in some brain parts, or the continuous synthesis of new neurons, or both, remains to be further investigated. Childhood amnesia cannot be explained by simple forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Big Society” initiative – launched at the turn of this decade by the incoming British government – was&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;a call for politics to recognise the importance of community and social solidarity. It has since fizzled out, and for a while communitarianism fell out of the political conversation, but it has returned post-Brexit, sometimes with a nationalist or even nativist flavour. The US political scientist Robert Putnam’s research is sometimes recruited into these arguments, as his data suggests that racially and ethnically diverse neighbourhoods have lower levels of trust and social capital, which would seem an obstacle to community-building. But an international team led by Jared Nai at Singapore Management University has published &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-13651-001&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/i&gt; that suggests that diverse neighbourhoods are in fact &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; likely to generate prosocial helpful behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33944&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putnam’s work tallies with a distinguished psychological idea, &lt;i&gt;conflict theory&lt;/i&gt;, which suggests salient distinctions between people in an area heightens a sense of competition between groups over resources. Because race is so visible – &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.85.4.616&quot;&gt;neuroscientific studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; we perceive it earlier even than gender – the argument goes that racially diverse areas lead people to, as Putnam puts it, hunker down and withdraw. Consistent with this view, Putnam’s data shows that multicultural areas have lower levels of trust – even between people of the same race – and some evidence, but not all, has shown this has a knock-on adverse effect on civic engagement and volunteering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nai’s team predicted that despite this, racially diverse areas would show more, not less prosocial helping. They drew on &lt;i&gt;contact theory&lt;/i&gt;, which suggests that active contact with people from other groups humanises them. In particular, such contact leads people to view their own identity as broader, potentially encompassing all of humanity – this could be a mechanism to encourage prosociality. As most of the contact theory work puts people in extended face to face interactions, the question was whether mere ambient diversity will help (simply being around other people who look different).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first study showed that diverse areas have a more prosocial online buzz. Nai’s team pulled 60 million tweets and identified the usage frequency of words from James Pennebaker’s “prosocial dictionary” that are known to correlate with a desire to help others. Indexing across 200 metropolitan areas, they found that tweets from more racially diverse areas used prosocial language more frequently. But language is an indirect measure, and it may be that people with that style voluntarily move into areas that are more diverse. So Nai’s group looked at international data, as moving country is rarer than moving cities, and at levels of actual (reported) helping. The data came from a 2012 Gallop World Poll that asked “in the past month, have you helped a stranger?”. Across 128 countries, Nai’s team found that it was the more ethnically diverse countries that scored a greater frequency of yes responses to this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Nai’s team wanted to see if the factor that turned diversity into helping was people having a broader sense of identity. They surveyed US people online using the same helping question used in the Gallop poll, and replicated the greater diversity/greater helping correlation for different zip codes for around 500 participants (good gender balance, average age 33). They also asked the participants how much they identified with three groups: people in my community, Americans, and all humans everywhere. They found that diverse neighbourhoods were associated with higher identification with all of humanity, and statistical analysis suggested, but could not prove, that this (and only this) form of identification was driving the helping behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the researchers looked at help for outsiders during a crisis. Real data from a helping website set up following the Boston marathon showed that more offers of help came from zip codes that were more racially diverse, even after controlling for distance from site and wealth of the zip code. And in an online experiment, 300 participants stated they would be more likely to offer help following a bombing when they had been asked to imagine living in a very diverse neighbourhood – again mediated by a greater sense of connection to humanity.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the studies controlled for a range of factors related to area or nation, such as income / national economics, education, urbanisation, and religious diversity. One weakness is that apart from the last study, all this work is correlational. It would be interesting to track neighbourhoods over time to see how changes have an impact dynamically – maybe an area renowned for its diversity that evolved organically over decades would have a different attitude to the idea of “one humanity” than a neighbourhood with no sense of itself as diverse per se and that had changed fairly rapidly due to impersonal market or governmental forces.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting detail from the international study is that trust scores (available for a subset of nations) were lower in more ethnically diverse countries, in line with the Putnam data. So it seems that a populace can both be less trusting and more willing to help strangers, which is something to puzzle on. But regardless, the new data pushes back against the assertion that diverse neighbourhoods struggle to show communal spirit, and suggests that ambient contact with those superficially different can underscore our common humanity and obligations to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-13651-001&quot;&gt;People in more racially diverse neighborhoods are more prosocial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title type="html">On the top of all the wonderful stories, there is one thing, I think, could bring your podcast to  another level of perfection:  Is it possible to list some of the information mentioned in the interview?  Such as in #31 Trial and Error Learning, Dr. Niv mentioned a book that brought her into the field of Neural Science -- I would like to read the book, but failed to find it because I can't get the name of the book right, given English is my second language... Please?</title>

		<updated>2018-05-22T09:40:44+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/Eating-Disorders-Pregnancy-1-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating disorders are mental illnesses characterized by severely disturbed eating behaviors and cognitions that impact on an individual’s health and wellbeing. Research suggests around 7.5% of women are affected with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23495197&quot;&gt;eating disorders during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and there is an increased risk of pregnancy complications (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17329747&quot;&gt;1,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18720472&quot;&gt;2,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3873840/&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, pregnancy can be a difficult time emotionally for some women with eating disorders as they encounter changes to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/papt.12076&quot;&gt;appetite and body weight and shape&lt;/a&gt; that are beyond their control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the increased risks, health professionals need to be able to identify women with eating disorders during and after pregnancy so that they can effectively monitor and support these women in accordance with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng69&quot;&gt;clinical guidance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stigma of having an eating disorder, as is common with other mental health problems, means women are unlikely to say that they have an eating disorder without being directly asked by a health professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We carried out a qualitative study to understand the potential barriers to identifying eating disorders from the perspectives of both women and midwives and health visitors. These health professionals are important as they often have the most contact with women during antenatal and early years’ care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify an eating disorder, health professionals need to be able to enquire effectively with women and likewise women need to openly disclose their difficulties. Health professionals receive little to no training on eating disorders so they may lack the knowledge and understanding to confidently ask women about these difficulties. The stigma of having an eating disorder, as is common with other mental health problems, means women are unlikely to say that they have an eating disorder without being directly asked by a health professional. Thus, eating disorders can go undetected during this time and women will not receive the care and support they may need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two foreseeable approaches that could address these barriers to improve the identification of women experiencing eating disorders during and after pregnancy. Firstly, our research highlights the lack of training resources on eating disorders available for health professionals. This finding has led on to work with King’s College London, funded by The Health Foundation, to translate the research and clinical guidance into practical and engaging training resources for health professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resources include a short animation film that has been co-designed by women with eating disorders, health professionals and key organisations, such as Tommy’s, Beat and the Institute of Health Visiting. We launched the resources during Eating Disorders Awareness Week 2018 and they are available for free at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eatingdisordersandpregnancy.co.uk&quot;&gt;www.eatingdisordersandpregnancy.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, many public health campaigns have been launched in the UK to raise awareness and reduce stigma about mental health, but eating disorders, and particularly highlighting the experience of pregnant women and mothers, have been missing in these campaigns. Campaigns are needed to specifically target eating disorders during and after pregnancy. Awareness raising activities may empower pregnant women and mothers with eating disorders to be able to talk openly and access support without worrying about negative judgements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of activities that raise both professional and public awareness about eating disorders can help facilitate open and informed discussions between a woman and a health professional, and enables that health professional to be able to plan and deliver tailored care that is responsive to the specific needs of that woman. This type of tailored care could not only improve pregnancy outcomes but also patient experience, which is often as important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our country doesn’t do many things well, but when it comes to big occasions, no one else comes close,” so claimed an instructor I heard at the gym this week. He might be an expert in physical fitness but it’s doubtful this chap was drawing on any evidence or established knowledge about the UK’s standing on the international league table of pageantry or anything else, and what’s more, he probably didn’t care about his oversight. What he probably did feel is a social pressure to have an opinion on the royal wedding that took place last weekend. To borrow the terminology of US psychologist John Petrocelli, he was probably bullshitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In essence,” Petrocelli explains in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103117305127&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, “the bullshitter is a relatively careless thinker/communicator and plays fast and loose with ideas and/or information as he bypasses consideration of, or concern for, evidence and established knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While pontificating on Britain’s prowess at pomp is pretty harmless, Petrocelli has more serious topics in mind. “Whether they be claims or expressions of opinions about the effects of vaccinations, the causes of success and failure, or political ideation, doing so with little to no concern for evidence or truth is wrong,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are countless psychology studies into &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/category/lying/&quot;&gt;lying&lt;/a&gt; (which is different from bullshitting because it involves deliberately concealing the truth) and an increasing number into &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/12/11/fake-news-leaves-a-particularly-lasting-impression-on-the-less-smart/&quot;&gt;fake news&lt;/a&gt; (again, unlike BS, deliberate manipulation is part of it). However, there are virtually none on bullshitting. Now Petrocelli has made a start, identifying several social factors that encourage or deter the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33935&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research began with nearly 600 people on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk survey website reading that a man named Jim had pulled out of running for a seat on the City Council. Participants thought they were taking part in a study of how we ascribe causes to others’ behaviour (the term bullshitting did not appear anywhere in the experiment instructions), and after they read about Jim’s resignation, they were invited to list five possible reasons and any related thoughts on why Jim might have done this – a perfect opportunity for bullshitters to let rip!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrocelli varied the precise conditions to see how this affected people’s propensity to bullshit when answering. For starters, he manipulated background knowledge by earlier on giving half the participants 13 facts about Jim, such as that he liked to be admired. Petrocelli also manipulated the social pressure to give an opinion, telling half the participants they didn’t have to list any reasons if they didn’t want to. Finally, Petrocelli manipulated audience knowledge, telling half the participants that their reasons would be scored by judges who knew Jim extremely well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure bullshitting, Petrocelli later asked the participants to score their own reasons, based on how much they had been concerned with genuine evidence and established knowledge; essentially they assessed their own BS levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the factors that Petrocelli manipulated made a difference. Overall, the participants who received no background information on Jim admitted to engaging in more bullshitting. Participants also bullshitted more when they felt more obliged to give an opinion, and when their audience was not knowledgeable about him. These latter two factors (obligation and audience knowledge) interacted, with social obligation being more potent. When feeling obligated to have an opinion, uninformed participants bullshitted a lot even when they knew their audience knew more than they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anything that an audience may do to enhance the social expectation that one should have or provide an opinion appears to increase the likelihood of the audience receiving bullshit,” Petrocelli said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without such pressure, however, the risk of being caught out was a deterrent to BS and Petrocelli further explored what he calls the “ease of passing bullshit hypothesis” in a follow up experiment. Online participants were invited to justify their attitudes on hot-button social issues: affirmative action; nuclear weapons; and capital punishment. Crucially, Petrocelli manipulated who participants thought would be reading their justifications – either he gave participants no information about their audience or he told them a sociology professor with expertise on these issues would be reading their views (and further, that the prof either agreed with their positions; disagreed; or his own position was concealed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants subsequently rated their own BS levels (i.e. they rated whether they’d been concerned with evidence or established knowledge) and it was the participants not told about a professor, or who thought the professor agreed with them, who especially admitted to more bullshitting. Those participants who knew a professor with opposing views was going to read their arguments admitted to the least bullshitting. Fear of being called out, in other words, appears to be a strong deterrent to spewing BS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does this leave us? It’s a shame there was no objective marker of bullshitting in this research – sure, it makes sense to ask people if they considered any evidence or knowledge, but at least some kind of third-party assessment would have been useful. You might also have your doubts about the realism of these online experiments. Giving inconsequential opinions on a survey website is rather removed from the real life scourge of the office colleague who is forever sharing their questionable wisdom on what you need to do to stay healthy or how the country should be run. Nonetheless, all empirical investigations must start somewhere and Petrocelli said his studies “provide a great deal of information relevant to the social psychology of bullshitting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professor is under no illusions though about how hard it will be to translate his insights into practical anti-BS strategies. While his findings suggest that calling out BS (or the mere threat that it might be called out) can reduce the propensity for bullshitting to take place, Petrocelli notes that doing so “may not necessarily enhance evidence-based communication” and that instead it may just be a “conversation killer”. He concludes that “future research will do well to respond to such questions empirically and determine effective ways of enhancing the concern for evidence and truth.”&lt;/p&gt;

(2018)&lt;/a&gt; is the latest entry into the iconoclastic hullabaloo claiming a non-synaptic basis for learning and memory. In short, “RNA extracted from the central nervous system of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplysia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;sea slug, a common model system to study the neurobiology of learning and memory&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; given long-term sensitization training induced sensitization when injected into untrained animals...” The results support the minority view that long-term memory is not encoded by synaptic strength, according to the authors, but instead by molecules inside cells (à la &lt;a href=&quot;http://nautil.us/blog/heres-why-most-neuroscientists-are-wrong-about-the-brain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Here's Why Most Neuroscientists Are Wrong About the Brain&quot;&gt;Randy Gallistel&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam Calhoun has a nice summary of the paper at &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuroecology.wordpress.com/2018/05/17/learn-by-consuming-the-brains-of-your-enemies/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Learn by consuming the brains of your enemies&quot;&gt;Neuroecology&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;...there is a particular &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;reflex&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(memory) that changes when they [&lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;] have  experienced a lot of shocks. How memory is encoded is a bit debated but  one strongly-supported mechanism (especially in these snails) is that  there are changes in the amount of particular proteins that are  expressed in some neurons. These proteins might make more of one channel  or receptor that makes it more or less likely to respond to signals  from other neurons. So for instance, when a snail receives its first  shock a neuron responds and it withdraws its gills. Over time, each  shock builds up more proteins that make the neuron respond more and  more. These proteins are built up by the amount of RNA (the “blueprint”  for the proteins, if you will) that are located in the vicinity of the  neuron that can receive this information.  ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new paper shows that in these snails, you can just dump the RNA  on these neurons from someone else and the RNA has already encoded  something about the type of protein it will produce.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2018/05/18/epic-snail-about-that-injectable-memory-study/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Slug Life: About That Injectable Memory Study&quot;&gt;Neuroskeptic&lt;/a&gt; has a more contentious take on the study, casting doubt on the notion that sensitization of a simple reflex to any noxious stimulus (a form of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.angelfire.com/linux/vjtorley/habitlearn.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Should we call habituation and sensitization 'learning'?&quot;&gt;non-associative “learning”&lt;/a&gt;) produces “memories” as we typically think of them. But senior author Dr. David Glanzman tolerated none of this, and expressed strong disagreement in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://disq.us/p/1sm8h93&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“I’m afraid you have a fundamental misconception of what memory is. We claim that our experiments demonstrate transfer of the memory—or  essential components of the memory—for sensitization.  Now, although  sensitization may not comport with the common notion of memory—it’s not  like the memory of my Midwestern grandmother’s superb blueberry pies,  for example—it nevertheless has unambiguous status as memory.  ...  [&lt;i&gt;didactic lesson continues&lt;/i&gt;] ...  We do not claim in our paper that declarative memories—such as my  memory of my grandmother’s blueberry pies—or even simpler forms of  associative memories like those induced during classical  conditioning—can be transferred by RNA.   That remains to be seen.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so Glanzman gets to define what memory is. But later on he's caught in a trap and &lt;a href=&quot;http://disq.us/p/1smxqvo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has to admit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“Of course, there are many phenomena that can be loosely regarded as  memory—the crease in folded paper, for example, can be said to represent  the memory of a physical action.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was in response to &lt;span class=&quot;post-byline&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;author publisher-anchor-color&quot;&gt;Harvey-6-3.5, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://disq.us/p/1smwxbk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;who said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“So a transfer of RNA that activates a cellular mechanism associated with  touch isn't memory, but rather just exogenously turning on a cellular  pathway.  By that logic, gene therapy to treat sickle cell anemia  changes blood &quot;memory&quot;.”&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my favorite comment was from &lt;a href=&quot;http://disq.us/p/1smzrw4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Smut Clyde&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“Kandel set the precedent that reflexes in Aplysia are &quot;memories&quot;, and now we're stuck with it.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This reminded me of Dr. Kandel's bold [&lt;i&gt;outlandish?&lt;/i&gt;] attempt to link psychoanalysis, &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; withdrawal reflexes, and human anxiety (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6137962&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kandel, 1983&lt;/a&gt;). I was a bit flabbergasted that gill withdrawal in a sea slug was considered “mentation” (thought) and could support Freudian views.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;In the past, ascribing a particular behavioral feature to an unobservable mental process essentially excluded the problem from direct biological study because the complexity of the brain posed a barrier to any complementary biological analysis. But the nervous systems of invertebrates are quite accessible to a cellular analysis of behavior, including certain internal representations of environmental experiences that can now be explored in detail; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;This encourages the belief that elements of cognitive mentation relevant to humans and related to psychoanalytic theory can be explored directly [&lt;i&gt;in Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;] and need no longer be merely inferred.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;- click on image for a larger view -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MurE3Re02sE/WwKP1D_5D6I/AAAAAAAAMi0/dxixVXIvQe8d6Rp47OZz87ot0v3CZicewCLcBGAs/s1600/kandel%2B1983.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;565&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1077&quot; height=&quot;219&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MurE3Re02sE/WwKP1D_5D6I/AAAAAAAAMi0/dxixVXIvQe8d6Rp47OZz87ot0v3CZicewCLcBGAs/s400/kandel%2B1983.png&quot; width=&quot;420&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anticipatory anxiety in humans is isomorphic to invertebrate responses in a classical aversive conditioning paradigm, and chronic anxiety is recreated by long-term sensitization paradigms. Perhaps I missed the translational advances here, and any application to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/sections/psychoanalysis-and-neuropsychoanalysis#articles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Psychoanalytic and Neuropsychoanalytic&lt;/a&gt; practice that has been fully realized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we want to accept a flexible definition of learning and memory in animals, why not consider associative learning experiments in pea plants, where a neutral cue predicting the location of a light source had a greater effect on the direction of plant growth than innate phototropism  (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep38427&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gagliano et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;)? Or review the literature on associative and non-associative learning in &lt;i&gt;Mimosa&lt;/i&gt;? (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4814444/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Abramson &amp;amp; Chicas-Mosier, 2016&lt;/a&gt;). Or evaluate the field of ‘plant neurobiology’ and even the ‘Philosophy of Plant Neurobiology’ (&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-016-1040-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Calvo, 2016&lt;/a&gt;). Or are the possibilities of chloroplast-based consciousness and “mentation” without neurons too threatening (&lt;i&gt;or &lt;/i&gt;too fringe)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the end, we know we've reached peak plant cognition when a predictive coding model appears — &lt;i&gt;Predicting green: really radical (plant) predictive processing&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5493793/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Calvo &amp;amp; Friston, 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further Reading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.ca/2017/04/the-big-ideas-in-cognitive-neuroscience.html&quot;&gt;The Big Ideas in Cognitive Neuroscience, Explained&lt;/a&gt; (especially the sections on Gallistel and Ryan)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.ca/2017/04/what-are-big-ideas-in-cognitive.html&quot;&gt;What are the Big Ideas in Cognitive Neuroscience?&lt;/a&gt; (you can watch the videos of their 2017 CNS talks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;edited to indicate my emphasis on &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;reflex&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd yZ8quc&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; more specifically, the gill withdrawal reflex in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia &lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd yZ8quc&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; which can only go so far as a model of other forms of memory, in my view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2  &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Another skeptic (but for different reasons) is Dr. Tomás Ryan, who was paraphrased in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/memory-transferred-between-snails-challenging-standard-theory-of-how-the-brain-remembers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Memory Transferred between Snails, Challenging Standard Theory of How the Brain Remembers&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scientific American&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;But [Ryan] doesn’t think the behavior of the snails, or the cells, proves  that RNA is transferring memories. He said he doesn’t understand how  RNA, which works on a time scale of minutes to hours, could be causing  memory recall that is almost instantaneous, or how RNA could connect  numerous parts of the brain, like the auditory and visual systems, that  are involved in more complex memories. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But I haven't won the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kavli.columbia.edu/leadership/kandel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Eric Kandel&quot;&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt;, so what do I know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abramson CI, Chicas-Mosier AM.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Ion channels can either be modelled at a macroscopic level, using a deterministic representation such as the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, or at a more detailed single-channel level, where their stochastic nature is taken into account by using a Markov formalism. The Hodgkin-Huxley model describes the combined collective effect of the channel population on the membrane potential, but it does not provide a comprehensive kinetic diagram. As a result, various aspects of the behaviour and consequently the functional role of individual channels can be overlooked. On the other hand, a more accurate alternative channel formalism is the Markov model. In Markov models, a single channel is represented by a kinetic scheme comprising a finite set of discrete intermediate states with probabilistic transitions from one state to another. Channel noise, introduced by the stochastic gating of the ion channels, can affect the generation and timing of action potentials and therefore potentially also single neuron computations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present study, the voltage-gated channels of a morphologically realistic conductance based cerebellar nucleus (CN) neuron model were expressed as Markov formalisms and their behaviour was compared with their deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley type counterparts. Our results show that the majority of the deterministic CN channel models could easily be replaced by stochastic versions, without affecting neuronal behaviour. However, this was not the case for the fast sodium channel, where the parameter changes that had to be introduced in order to match the activity of the stochastic and deterministic models depended on the level of activation of the neuron, even for very small single channel conductances in the stochastic model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When, in Shakespeare’s &lt;i&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/i&gt;, Marc Anthony delivers his funeral oration for his fallen friend, he famously says “The evil that men do lives on; the good is oft interred with their bones.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony was talking about how history would remember Caesar, lamenting that doing evil confers greater historical immortality than doing good. But what about &lt;i&gt;literal&lt;/i&gt; immortality?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there’s no room for such a notion in the scientific worldview, belief in an immortal afterlife was common throughout history and continues to this day across many cultures. Formal, codified belief systems like Christianity have a lot to say about the afterlife, including how earthly behaviour determines our eternal fate: the virtuous among us will apparently spend the rest of our spiritual days in paradise, while the wicked are condemned to suffer until the end of time. Yet, according to Christianity and many other formal religions, there’s no suggestion that anyone – good, bad or indifferent – gets more or less immortality, which is taken to be an all-or-nothing affair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not how ordinary people think intuitively about immortality, though. In a series of seven studies &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167217754068&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Kurt Gray at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and colleagues, have found that, whether religious or not, people tend to think that those who do good or evil in their earthly lives achieve greater immortality than those who lead more morally neutral lives. What’s more, the virtuous and the wicked are seen to achieve different kinds of immortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33929&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings complement previous work showing how we see moral character as a defining feature of people, both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027713002497&quot;&gt;when they’re alive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17156519&quot;&gt;when their souls depart&lt;/a&gt;. In the new studies, Gray and colleagues extended this, finding that their participants (recruited online via Amazon Mechanical Turk and including atheists and people of different religious faiths), rated historical figures who were extremely good or bad – Martin Luther King or Hitler, for example – as achieving a greater degree of immortality than morally neutral figures, such as Ameila Earhart and Andy Warhol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if both good and evil people are seen to achieve greater immortality than the more morally neutral, might they nonetheless experience different kinds of immortality? For many of the world’s major religions, the answer is clearly yes: perform morally positive acts on earth and you go to The Good Place (Heaven) to enjoy total freedom in a paradisiacal realm, but do evil and you go instead to The Bad Place (Hell) to be tormented for all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casting a wider anthropological net, many smaller, less formal belief systems also posit that good and evil spirits experience immorality in different ways. In particular, it’s common to find the belief that while virtuous spirits enjoy a transcendental freedom, evil spirits are more likely to be trapped or confined in some way, such as the Iroquois belief that they are eternally confined to their homes. Similar ideas crop up in popular culture too. When the evil wizard Voldemort dies in &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/i&gt;, his soul lives on in magical objects called Horcruxes. But when Obi-Wan Kenobi dies in the &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; films, his spirit is able to roam freely through the ethereal realm of the Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gray and his colleagues found their participants held similar intuitive beliefs about the fates of deceased good, bad or neutral historical figures: they were more likely to see good souls as living in a transcendent state, wicked souls as trapped, and neutral souls as slightly less free than good ones but freer than bad ones.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reverse inference also held: reading about someone who had recently died and whose spirit had left the earthly realm and moved beyond space and time prompted participants to infer that this must have been a good person, while the converse led them to think the person must have been bad.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, participants inferred that spirits inhabiting expansive locations, like hot deserts , arctic tundra or mountaintops, were more benevolent than those living in more confined locations, like a narrow trench,underground cave or tent in the woods, irrespective of how pleasant those locations were deemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such inferences might explain why paranormal events are typically chalked up to malevolent spirits. The researchers asked more participants to imagine being in the house of someone recently deceased and that they felt a strange sensation as their spirit passed by. After reading these stories, people tended to view this spirit as malevolent, as a trapped spirit must be a bad spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In explaining their findings, Gray’s team suggest that seeing good souls as free and transcendent and bad ones as confined and trapped stems in part for a basic desire for justice, with bad souls ending up in a spiritual prison and less able to roam and harm others. Such a desire may also receive a cognitive boost from the fact that notions of good and evil are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11301525&quot;&gt;metaphorically&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1502279&quot;&gt;associated&lt;/a&gt; with ideas of lightness and airiness, and darkness and constriction, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results did not appear to depend on whether participants already held religious beliefs about the afterlife – the same patterns were found regardless of their stated faith or supernatural belief, suggesting that our folk intuitions about immortality tend to overpower any formal belief systems that we claim to subscribe to. “These ways of thinking are very intuitive, and overcoming them takes effort,” says Gray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One caveat to these studies concerns the fact that the participants were from a Western, educated, industrialised, rich, democratic (WEIRD) society. Psychological insights generated from WEIRD participants do not always generalize to other cultures, and in this case beliefs about reincarnation may have been under-represented. But Gray and colleagues argue that the cross-cultural similarities in the beliefs about the afterlife that inspired the research suggest that the new studies tap into a universal aspect of our psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gray is currently writing up the results of follow-on studies in which he looked at how the state of someone’s mind at the point of death – say, whether it was at the peak of health or wracked by dementia – affected how participants perceived its prospects for immortality. So while we may not ever be able to achieve literal immortality, at least we may soon know what it takes for others to &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; we’re immortal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;—&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167217754068&quot;&gt;To be immortal, do good or evil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Psychoanalysis, a therapeutic method for treating mental health issues, explores the interaction of the conscious and unconscious elements of the mind. Originating with Sigmund Freud in the late 19th century, the practice has evolved exponentially in terms of both treatment and research applications. Much of Freud’s theory acknowledged that childhood experiences often affect individuals later in life, which was expanded upon by analysts who believed that mental health issues can affect individuals at all stages of their life. Child psychoanalysis has developed into a well-established technique for children and adolescents, with specialised approaches to working with younger individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When considering the history of this specialism, a few key figures come to mind. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-34345&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Melanie Klein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-38140&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Donald Winnicott&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-31126&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Anna Freud&lt;/a&gt; began work with adolescents and infants as young as three years of age. Among a variety of techniques, each of the analysts incorporated elements of play in their therapeutic approaches as a means of understanding adult associations, behavioural and internalised expression, or in order to develop an authentic self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a brief introduction to each of their contributions to the field:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;flex-video&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested in finding out more? Here are some additional facts about the lives and work of Melanie Klein, Donald Winnicott, and Anna Freud:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1914, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-31126&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Freud&lt;/a&gt; took a holiday in England but became an enemy alien when war broke out. After returning to Vienna, she began work as an apprentice elementary school teacher, qualifying six years later and joining the school staff. She remained a teacher—in the widest sense—all her life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite being exempt from wartime service, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-38140&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Winnicott&lt;/a&gt; interrupted his studies in 1917 and joined the Royal Navy, to serve on a destroyer as a surgeon-probationer. During his downtime on the ship, he tackled the novels of Henry James.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modernist writer &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-37018&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Virginia Woolf&lt;/a&gt; found &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-34345&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Klein&lt;/a&gt; to be a “woman of character and force and some submerged—how shall I say—not craft, but subtlety: something working underground. A pull, a twist, like an undertow: menacing. A bluff grey-haired lady, with large bright imaginative eyes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysis of one family member by another, or even by a close friend, is considered unacceptable in contemporary analysis. Yet in 1918, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-55514&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sigmund Freud&lt;/a&gt; did not set a precedent and he would often analyse &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-31126&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;his daughter Anna&lt;/a&gt;. Klein also analysed her sons, Erich and Hans, as well as her daughter Melitta. Unlike Freud, however, she published their analyses under pseudonyms. No records exist of Freud’s analysis of Anna.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1936, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-38140&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Winnicott&lt;/a&gt;’s work was supervised by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-34345&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Klein&lt;/a&gt;, whose influence in the British Psychoanalytical Society was substantial. Winnicott was attracted to many of Klein’s ideas but always processed them in the light of his own clinical experience. Winnicott remained an independent thinker as the ideas he valued, whether Klein’s or not, often underwent alteration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were disputes between &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-34345&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Klein&lt;/a&gt; and her followers and the psychoanalytic refugees from Vienna and Berlin, led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-31126&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Freud&lt;/a&gt;, who strongly objected to what they regarded as the “London-centred doctrinal deviance” of the Kleinian group. The two groups disagreed over the depth of interpretation of the unconscious, and the presence, or absence, of transference in children. These disagreements led to a series of Controversial Discussions held between 1941 and 1945, moderated by a “Middle Group” that included &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-38140&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Winnicott&lt;/a&gt;. The differences were never fully resolved, but the debate ended in a compromise whereby two separate training groups were organized. A split in the society, though threatened, was averted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 A study claiming that a &quot;memory&quot; could be transferred from one animal to another in form of an injection has caused a lot of excitement.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/barbed-wire-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Torture is a destructive and violent act, which is far from eradicated. In recent years &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/get-involved/stop-torture/&quot;&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; has found torture occurring in 141 countries, corresponding to three-quarters of the world’s countries. Torture as a phenomenon has received increasing attention as a public health concern and our understanding of the complexity of the consequences of torture has developed to include a focus on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2397.2005.00336.x&quot;&gt;inter-generational&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicaljournals.se/jrm/content/abstract/10.2340/16501977-2322&quot;&gt;economic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.udmercy.edu/handle/10429/800&quot;&gt;genetic&lt;/a&gt; manifestation of the harm torture creates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3979573/&quot;&gt;calls for economic studies&lt;/a&gt; of the cost of torture have focused how knowledge of these cost can aide calls for torture prevention and inform better rehabilitation programmes, as well as shed light on the longer-term economic consequences for torture survivors and their families. The economic perspective is a central part of an evidence-based approach to understanding and supporting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diw.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=diw_01.c.519323.de&quot;&gt;labour market integration of refugees resettled in Europe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conclude that rehabilitating torture survivors benefits not only the individuals who receive it but also … provides a net social benefit to society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study “&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-3145-3?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;amp;amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Health_Services_Research-Public_Health-Global&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_MAY2018_Rehabilitation_economic_torture_survivors&quot;&gt;Does multidisciplinary rehabilitation of tortured refugees represent ‘value-for-money’? A follow-up of a Danish case-study&lt;/a&gt;” is the first economic evaluation of this type of rehabilitation, from society’s point of view, as we look at the economic impact of providing rehabilitation to torture survivors and their families in host countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We attempt to capture some of the complexity of the consequences by including cost incurred directly at the individual, family and societal level. In doing so, we conclude that rehabilitating torture survivors benefits not only the individuals who receive it but also, once the families are included in the analysis, rehabilitation provides a net social benefit to society. However, Support systems and services addressing the after-effects of torture are challenged by the complex symptomatology presented by torture survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10120&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10120 size-large&quot; height=&quot;431&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/Blog-on-treatment-of-torture-victims-1024x690.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Source: iStock image from author.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;IStock image of author&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The terror of torture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torture serves the purpose of terrorizing and controlling the individual and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cvt.org/resources/publications&quot;&gt;breaking down the social fabric of communities&lt;/a&gt;. The physical and psychological trauma following torture often result in severe long-term impediments for the survivor, and not only it is devastating to the subjected individual, it affects whole families and society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some torture survivors display a high level of physical disability, persisting over time. These include, but are not restricted to, chronic muscle pain, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. The psychological responses to torture include Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, psychosis, phobias, bipolar disorder, and neuropsychological impairment. Typically, survivors also report sleep disturbances, flashbacks, guilt, concentration and memory issues, and a general negative self-image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survivors might also experience difficulties in controlling emotions, such as anger, which at times can lead to isolation, with knock-on adverse effect on their quality of life. Fulfilling parental or familial obligations can become problematic for survivors. Dysfunctional family relations might escalate into violence, but more subtle trauma transmission pathway could involve &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1363461514568442&quot;&gt;inappropriate communication of parental trauma&lt;/a&gt; to children in the families, leading to psychological distress in the children. These effects disseminate and impact society and communities in which survivors live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps less debated is the perspective that torture is not only a terrible human rights violation, but in addition to the damaging health effects and social costs to individuals and families, torture also results in economic losses. One such economic loss is related to the loss of labour income for the individual in cases where the physical or psychological ramifications of torture inhibit the person’s ability to retain a job or perhaps a caretaker in the family. Society might also bear cost related to long-term impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can create a circle of disadvantages, where poor education and mental distress lead to lack of opportunities and unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, costs of a more diffuse and less clearly associated nature also exist; society’s expenses related to provision of services are unlikely to be limited to health care alone but these expenses can be difficult to associate directly with the trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children of torture survivors may suffer from physical and emotional problems and experience learning difficulties, as well as difficulties in reasoning and participating appropriately in a classroom context. They might experience problems with developing healthy attachments to parents, educators or other caretakers, and lack a sense of self-efficacy and future orientation. This can create a circle of disadvantages, where poor education and mental distress lead to lack of opportunities and unemployment. Ultimately, the result could be a sense of alienation from society, which attributes to the greater loss of productivity for the whole of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving on from here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings presented in our study suggest that rehabilitation is not only in the interest of society based on moral and ethical grounds, but it might well be an economically sound priority as well. While the right to rehabilitation is set out in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/RemedyAndReparation.aspx&quot;&gt;international law&lt;/a&gt;, economic priorities could influence policy makers to uphold and protect this right more than on human rights grounds alone. In addition, it should not be neglected either that economic self-sufficiency and labour force participation is part of regaining quality of life and dignity for torture survivors.&lt;/p&gt;

Shaded areas show confidence intervals. Via &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196938&quot;&gt;An Tran-Duy et al, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s well established that elite athletes have a longer life expectancy than the general public. A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-015-0024-x&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of over 50 studies comprising half a million people estimated the athletic advantage to be between 4 and 8 years, on average. This comes as little surprise. One can easily imagine how the same genetic endowment and training necessary to develop physical prowess in sport might also manifest in physical health. Now for the first time, a study &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196938&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (open access) shows that athletes of the mind – chess grandmasters – show the same longevity advantage as athletes of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33906&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Tran-Duy at the University of Melbourne and his colleagues obtained data on over 1,200 chess grandmasters, mostly men, from 28 countries in three world regions, including whether or not they survived each successive year after receiving their title, all the way up to the beginning of 2017. From this, the researchers calculated the average yearly survival rates, adjusting for region, age and sex, which allowed them to come up with estimated life expectancies for grandmasters of different ages in different years. They did the same with data for over 15,000 olympic medalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no difference in the average life expectancy of the athletes and the chess grandmasters, but both groups showed a sizeable life expectancy advantage compared to the general population. For instance, in 2010, the average life expectancy of a chess grandmaster aged 25 was 6.3 years longer than the average for a 25-year-old member of the public. For a 55-year-old chess grandmaster, life expectancy was 4.5 years longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study can’t tell us anything about why chess grandmasters live longer than the public. It’s possible some of the causes are indirect, such as the grandmasters possibly having higher average IQ (which is itself associated with longevity); elite chess players are also known to take more care of their physical fitness than the general population; and the social and economic benefits of becoming a grandmaster, especially notable in Eastern Europe, may have health benefits. Chess may also have direct health benefits, including via its known effects on the brain – for instance, it reduces risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tran-Duy and his team begin their paper quoting Isaac Asimov: “In life, unlike chess, the game continues after checkmate”, and they reference this quote in their conclusion. “Not only does the game of life continue after the checkmate,” they write, “but excelling in mind sports like chess means one is likely to play the game for longer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196938&quot;&gt;Longevity of outstanding sporting achievers: Mind versus muscle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abraham Maslow was one of the great psychological presences of the twentieth century, and his concept of self-actualisation has entered our vernacular and is addressed in most psychology textbooks. A core concept of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanistic_psychology&quot;&gt;humanistic psychology&lt;/a&gt;, self-actualisation theory has inspired a range of psychological therapies as well as approaches taken in social work. But a number of myths have crept into our understanding of the theory and the man himself. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022167818761929&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Humanistic Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, William Compton of Middle Tennessee State University aims to put the record straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33899&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maslow’s most penetrating idea is that we have a hierarchy of needs, proceeding from physiological needs like water or warmth, through safety, love, esteem and then self-actualisation. He argued that lower needs occupy our attention when they are unmet and make it more difficult to fulfil the higher ones – including self-actualisation, which is about becoming the self you always had the potential to be.&lt;/p&gt;

He finds there is a lack of strong evidence showing that individuals transition from one level of the hierarchy to the next, as Maslow claimed. However, research on this point is complicated by the widely mistaken belief that Maslow considered needs must be fully satisfied at each level before progressing. In fact, Maslow stated that everyone has unsatisfied needs at every level – who feels safe 100 per cent of the time?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in favour of the idea of progression through the hierarchy is evidence from comparisons of national populations. Cross-cultural research shows that when more people in a population have their basic needs met, a greater proportion also tend to reach self-actualisation, as compared with populations that are preoccupied with scarcities.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maslow also claimed that people are more likely to flourish when they hold self-actualising values like spontaneity, positive self-regard, and acceptance of paradoxes. There is supportive data associating these qualities with positive outcomes – including creativity, lower anxiety or a personal locus of control, and also – and perhaps more surprisingly – higher instances of peak experiences, higher sexual satisfaction, and less fear of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hierarchy is sometimes presented with another element slotted in: cognition needs, placed just below self-actualisation (as seen in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=need+for+cognition+maslow+hierarchy&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy_aakiYrbAhUiCsAKHQ3bCb0Q_AUICigB&amp;amp;biw=1280&amp;amp;bih=680&quot;&gt;these examples&lt;/a&gt;). In fact Maslow opposed this, as he saw cognition as a tool that can serve every need at every level, whether in knowing self-defense techniques to help you feel safe, or knowing ourselves. For him, it lay outside the hierarchy. Another point often forgotten is that self-actualisation isn’t Maslow’s pinnacle. He broke out another stage for “peakers” – self actualised individuals who also experience peak or mystical experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compton moves on to address allegations about who and what the theory is for. He disputes the idea that it encourages self-centredness: many of the self-actualisation qualities Maslow emphasised are actually centred on others, like fairness, service, and adherence to a universal framework of values. Moreover, two of Maslow’s favoured reference points when talking about self-actualisation were Alfred Adler’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gemeinschaftsgefuhl&quot;&gt;gemeinschaftsgefühl&lt;/a&gt; (the psychological health that follows from caring about others) and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva&quot;&gt;bodhisattva&lt;/a&gt; (the Buddhist notion of one who strives for compassion towards others).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the related charge that self-actualisation is elitist, a preoccupation reserved for the privileged? This criticism needs some thinking through. There is a case that Maslow didn’t pay enough attention to how sexism or racism could impede self-actualisation, although his writings did show a more vague sensitivity to life throwing you a trickier hand. It’s true many of his self-actualised examples are white men, but he also cited figures such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Addams&quot;&gt;Jane Addams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass&quot;&gt;Frederick Douglass&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Tubman&quot;&gt;Harriet Tubman&lt;/a&gt;. And while it may seem like self-actualisation requires plenty of disposable income and leisure time, what Maslow meant by self-actualisation is bringing your full self to the moment, which includes dedicating yourself to work, how you treat others in daily interactions, and holding yourself to the highest standards. You can do all that from wherever you are standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Compton deals with the references in Maslow’s copious writing to the self-actualised&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;as “more fully human” versus the “less evolved persons” who are lower down the hierarchy – at the very least, this is a case of bad optics. In his defense, Maslow repeatedly emphasised that he did not believe anyone was innately superior, just that some people made more of their potential. Compton argues that some of the criticism around this is motivated by defensiveness: that some people are apparently stung by the claim that someone can work on their personality and thus make it excellent, just as they can become an excellent gymnast or painter. I disagree – I think there is a case that Maslow’s language unhelpfully conjures a sense of individualistic exceptionalism that would probably feel right at home in a TED summit or posthumanist away-day. Not, I think, what he would have wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, Maslow’s work is not without flaws. But his reframing of psychology to look at upwards possibilities rather than constantly into pathology sparked a shift that anticipated the positive psychology movement by decades. So his ideas deserve to be better understood, so we can use them more effectively to better ourselves, and so they can be developed and built upon for professionals who are seeking a ladder to help humanity reach greatness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This highlights blog opens with an interview introduced by Piccoli, Richiero and Jaar, recently published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt;. Professor Gabriel Richet (1916-2014) is considered to be one of the pioneers of European Nephrology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this interview, recorded in Paris in 2010, Professor Richet gives an account of the early days of European Nephrology, describing himself as a “lucky man” and stating his view on what he considered the moral stature that every physician should have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This review has been published as part of an ongoing “Systems Medicine” thematic series in &lt;em&gt;BMC Systems Biology&lt;/em&gt; and gives us an overview of the systems biology tools currently being used to further our understanding of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Here, Zeller and colleagues state that applying innovative methodologies to increase our understanding of the causes of CVD may result in better assessment of the risk facts involved and pave the way for tailored therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They describe the current tools available, including various cardiac disease models, epidemiological cohort studies (such as the Framingham Heart Study) and publically available data sources. Various proposed methods for integrated data analyses are then discussed, all with general aim of classifying the data available in order to help guide diagnosis, treatment decisions and patient prognosis.  Finally, the authors acknowledge the various challenges and limitations that exist in systems medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10190 alignright&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/cigarette-2367456_1920-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death and is associated with a number of chronic diseases, such as CVD, cancer and stroke. Poor diet is also one of the top three preventable risk factors for CVD as well as being linked to obesity. Due to the pharmacological effects of nicotine, cigarette smoking is negatively associated with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, MacLean and colleagues investigated the correlation between smoking and poor diet. They analyzed data from the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) and found that there was a strong linear relationship between smoking and dietary energy density(ED), indicating high levels of consumption of high fat foods such as potato chips, cookies and processed cheese rather than low-ED foods such as leafy vegetables, fruit and pasta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude by stating that this demonstrates that that smoking is associated with poor diet and also that former smokers, although consuming a lower-ED diet than smokers, have a poorer diet compared to people who have not smoked at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Education&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-018-1178-2&quot;&gt;Passing MRCP (UK) PACES: a cross-sectional study examining the performance of doctors by sex and country&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, female doctors earn less and are less likely to be senior authors on academic paper but are also less likely to be sanctioned and have been found to perform better academically and clinically. International medical students also tend to perform less well academically that those from the UK, USA or Canada. What is not known, however, is to what extent gender influences performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, in an article recently published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Education&lt;/em&gt;, Unwin et al looked at the association between gender and performance via the Membership of the Royal Colleges of Physicians (UK) Practical Assessment of Clinical Examination Skills (PACES) examination. Taking the results of 7671 PACES, sex differences in first time pass rates were analyzed for three groups: (1) UK Medical graduates (2) non-UK medical graduates registered with the General Medical Council (GMC) and (3) non-UK medical graduates without GMC registration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was found that, for all groups, female doctors were more likely to pass at their first attempt, with the differences between genders particularly significant for non-UK medical graduates that were not registered with GMC. The authors conclude that further investigation is required in order to explain these results and also how examination performance may relate to performance in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

Using data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australian (HILDA) survey, they performed a longitudinal analysis using tailored Poisson regression models to estimate the risk of a person falling into poverty with adjustments made for age, employment status, place of residence, marital status and housing tenure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Population Attributable Risk methodology was then applied to estimate the proportion of poverty  directly attributable to psychological distress, as measured by the Kessler 10 scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that men, being psychological distressed increased their risk of falling into income poverty by 1.68 and multidimensional poverty (taking into account income, health status and education attainment) by 3.40. For women, having high psychological distress increased the risk of multidimensional poverty by 2.15. Based on this Is evidence, they conclude that falling into poverty has been an overlooked cost of poor mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Oral Health:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-018-0529-z?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Oral_Health-Medicine-Global&amp;amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_MAY2018_Highlights_BMC_Series_April&quot;&gt;General anxiety, dental anxiety, digit sucking, caries and oral hygiene status of children resident in a semi-urban population in Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is thought that some people will suck their fingers or thumbs (digit sucking) when they are suffering from anxiety or another emotional problem. In this study, published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Oral Health&lt;/em&gt;, a team of researchers investigated whether digit sucking is an indicator not only of general anxiety but also anxiety associated with dental issues, for example caries in a group of children in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is digit sucking  an indicator of both general anxiety and anxiety associated with dental issues?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study used data of children aged between 6 and 12 taken as part of a larger household survey. General anxiety levels were measured using the Revised Child Manifest Anxiety Scale and dental anxiety was measured using the Dental Subscale of the Child Fear Survey Schedule. Logistic regression was used to determine whether general anxiety or dental anxiety could be predicted according to whether someone was sucking their fingers and/or thumbs. The researchers used the same analysis to see whether general anxiety and dental anxiety could predict whether a child had caries and the general state of their oral health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed that, although digit sucking is not a significant predictor of dental anxiety and general anxiety, children with high general anxiety and high dental anxiety are more likely to have caries and good oral hygiene respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, in a time before Trump and Brexit and &lt;em&gt;Yanny and Laurel,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://meatybeefy.tumblr.com/post/147701310172/behind-the-dress-the-untold-story-of-thedress&quot;&gt;someone posted an overexposed photograph of a black and blue striped dress on Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;. Soon millions of people had seen it and started arguing about it. The reason? It quickly became apparent that about half of us – more often women and older people – perceive the dress, not as black and blue, but white and gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a neat example of real life echoing a classic psychology experiment (I’m referring to &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/p4403ed&quot;&gt;Asch&lt;/a&gt;), #thedress was enough to make you think your friends were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting&quot;&gt;gas lighting&lt;/a&gt; you – how could it be that you and they were looking at the exact same picture and yet seeing entirely different things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there are many optical illusions, including others that involve colour (see, for example, the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checker_shadow_illusion&quot;&gt;checker shadow&lt;/a&gt;” illusion, pictured right). What was special about #thedress was that it triggered a bimodal split in perceptual experience among the population. Also, many illusions trigger a fluctuating percept, but once someone perceives the dress one way, they usually keep seeing it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral hits happen overnight. Science is slow, but it’s catching up. With the passing of the years, numerous studies into #thedress have now been published – 23 according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29422223&quot;&gt;new review&lt;/a&gt;. Here we present you with a fascinating digest of what’s been discovered so far about the famous frock – researchers have made progress, certainly, yet much remains mysterious, making this a humbling experience for perceptual science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33874&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A big part of how you see the dress has to do with a process called colour constancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before any studies had been published, psychologists and vision experts were quick to explain that the #thedress illusion is related to a process called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_constancy&quot;&gt;colour constancy&lt;/a&gt;” whereby your brain takes environmental lighting effects (which are ambiguous in #thedress photo), and your own past experiences, into account when interpreting the precise wavelengths it believes are being reflected off a surface. The same automatic adjustment process allows us to recognise grass as green whatever the weather or time of day. The process sometimes goes wrong, though, like when the blue top you bought at the clothes store turns out to be black when you get home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How you see the dress depends partly on what inferences you make about the lighting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A team led by Rosa Lafer-Sousa found this to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4921196/#SD2&quot;&gt;the case&lt;/a&gt;. When they presented the dress against an obviously cool, blue-ish background (see image, left), most people saw it as white and gold, but when they presented it against a warm, yellowish background (right), most saw it as black and blue&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4921196/#SD2&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2018-05-17 at 08.39.21&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-33911&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;33911&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Screen Shot 2018-05-17 at 08.39.21&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/screen-shot-2018-05-17-at-08-39-21.png?w=211&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/screen-shot-2018-05-17-at-08-39-21.png?w=211&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/screen-shot-2018-05-17-at-08-39-21.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;211,246&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/16/three-years-of-research-into-thedress-digested-a-lesson-in-humility-for-perceptual-science/screen-shot-2018-05-17-at-08-39-21/&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/screen-shot-2018-05-17-at-08-39-21.png?w=129&amp;amp;h=150&quot; width=&quot;129&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers Andrey Chetverikov and Ivan Ivanchei later developed this idea by showing that people’s perception of the dress are &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0301006616643664&quot;&gt;related to their assumptions about the light source in the original photograph&lt;/a&gt;. In their survey, people who saw the dress as black and blue were twice as likely as the white and gold group to believe that the dress is illuminated from the front, as if with a flash. Conversely, white and gold perceivers were more likely to believe there was a window behind the dress (implying under exposure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the survey, time of day seemed to make a modest difference to these assumptions, but still, the fundamental reasons why we come to make different inferences about the lighting remains largely unknown. In their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elsevier.es/en-revista-archivos-sociedad-espanola-oftalmologia-english-496-resumen-which-are-colors-dress-review-S2173579418300239&quot;&gt;new review&lt;/a&gt; of research into #thedress, published in &lt;em&gt;Archivos de la Sociedad Española de Oftalmología&lt;/em&gt;, ophthalmologist Julio González Martín-Moro and his colleagues state that the “dichotomic behaviour of this optical illusion is surprising and leads us to consider two different versions of the software in charge of maintaining chromatic [colour] constancy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your initial impression of the dress are likely to stick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This stubbornness of the percept could be because our brains continue to make the same assumptions about the scene, but alternatively it might be what Leila Drissi Daoudi and her colleagues describe as an example of “one shot learning”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2613309&quot;&gt;To test this, they manipulated naive participants’ perception of the dress by using occluders to block out the background&lt;/a&gt; – when they used black occluders (see above), this induced the perception of the dress as white and gold in nearly everyone; when they used white occluders, the opposite was true. Crucially, when the researchers took the occluders away, very few participants experienced any change in their perception of the dress’ colours. “There seems to be a one-shot learning mechanism in play, which leads to an imprinting of the color perceived”, the researchers wrote, although they were unable to explain what (without the use of occluders) induces the initial and lasting perception – they tested the location of people’s initial eye movements to the dress, but this made no difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The brains of gold/white perceivers are engaged in more interpretive processing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent with the idea that our inferences about the background lighting are important to #thedress illusion, the results from a brain imaging study that was published in 2015 suggested that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/27/first-brain-scan-study-to-feature-that-dress/&quot;&gt;people who see the dress as white and gold may be engaged in more “top down” interpretive processing, albeit that this processing leads to a misleading perception&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers scanned the brains of volunteers while they looked at the dress and found that those who perceived it as white and gold exhibited more neural activity in a raft of brain areas, including in frontal, parietal (near the crown of the head) and temporal (near the ears) regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this brain scan study couldn’t answer is whether the extra neural processing is the cause or consequence of the gold/white perceptual experience of the dress. However, a survey of patients with multiple sclerosis suggested the neural activity may be causal. Researchers in Italy found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msard-journal.com/article/S2211-0348(16)30022-0/pdf&quot;&gt;with greater progression of the disease, people were more likely to perceive the dress as blue and black&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps, the researchers speculated, this is because greater impairment of colour processing regions in the cortex led to “a less demanding black and blue vision of The Dress in more advanced MS”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Differences in the eye may also account for the illusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we perceive the dress might not all be about colour constancy and top-down brain processing. A 2016 study found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161090&quot;&gt;“front end” factors might also be relevant&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the researchers found that  “macular pigment optical density” was higher in volunteers who saw the dress as white and gold. Macular pigment is found in the retina and a greater density increases the amount of short wavelength light that is absorbed by the eye. “Our results indicate that early-stage optical, retinal and neural factors influence perception of the Dress”, the researchers said. Consistent with this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osapublishing.org/josaa/viewmedia.cfm?uri=josaa-33-3-A137&amp;amp;seq=0&amp;amp;html=true&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; found that white and gold perceivers tended to have smaller pupils potentially limiting the amount of light that falls on the retina, thus suggesting another early stage influence upon the perception of the dress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Past experience seems to be more important than genetics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, researchers in London and Cambridge published &lt;a href=&quot;http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2599740&quot;&gt;the first twin study&lt;/a&gt; into how people perceive the dress. By comparing the similarities in perception between identical and non-identical twins, they estimated that around 34 per cent of the variance in people’s perception is due to genetic differences, while 66 per cent is due to environmental factors (i.e. including learning and past experience). This was a small study, however, and the findings are tentative. Omar Mahroo and his colleagues concluded that the environmental factors “…may include prior lifetime experience to different spectral and luminance environments, shaping retinal and higher neuronal processing, and the development and evolution of [how we come to name] object colors in various contexts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, there are lots of possibilities for how experience shapes our varied perceptions of colour in ambiguous scenes, all of which remain to be studied. We also know nothing about how common visual deficits, such as colour blindness and cataracts, interact with the perception of #thedress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lesson in humility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the senses, vision is the one that’s been studied most intensively by psychologists and neuroscientists. Despite this, there are no tests available that would allow even the best experts in the land to predict whether you will see the dress as black and blue or white and gold. And while we have some good ideas about the processes that are involved in #thedress illusion, so much remains mysterious about what leads each of us to view it one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of their review, González Martín-Moro and his colleagues come to a stark &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elsevier.es/en-revista-archivos-sociedad-espanola-oftalmologia-english-496-resumen-which-are-colors-dress-review-S2173579418300239&quot;&gt;conclusion:&lt;/a&gt; “…the fact is that researchers have failed to come up with a theory that can satisfactorily explain the dichotomic behaviour of the population when viewing said optical illusion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/psych_Writer&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;@Psych_Writer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;) is Editor of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/&quot;&gt;BPS Research Digest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and he continues to see the dress as white and gold&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Channels are resources for scientists, making it easy to keep up to date with developments in a particular area of study and offering a way for exceptional research to be recognized and highlighted. All Channel content is curated by our expert Channel Editors, who are active leaders in their fields of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first Channel, launched a year ago, was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/vdrrc&quot;&gt;Veterans Disability &amp;amp; Rehabilitation Research Channel&lt;/a&gt;, soon followed by Channels for &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/tuberculosis&quot;&gt;Tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/cholera&quot;&gt;Cholera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/dfs&quot;&gt;Disease Forecasting &amp;amp; Surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/rtcc&quot;&gt;Responding to Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/open-source-toolkit&quot;&gt;Open Source Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;. To celebrate the first year of these Channels, we are awarding a prize of $500 to the authors of the best PLOS research featured in our first three Channels (Veterans Disability &amp;amp; Rehabilitation Research, Tuberculosis and Open Source Toolkit), with the winners chosen via a public vote. The polls will soon be available on&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/PLOSChannels&quot;&gt; Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll share more information about the competition on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/collections/&quot;&gt;PLOS Channels and Collections blog&lt;/a&gt; in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested in getting your paper featured in a Channel? Authors are encouraged to suggest their papers for inclusion in a relevant Channel – simply contact us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:channels@plos.org&quot;&gt;channels@plos.org&lt;/a&gt; (email) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PLOSChannels&quot;&gt;@PLOSChannels&lt;/a&gt; (Twitter) to let us know about your work, and Channel Editors will consider it for the next update. PLOS authors can also suggest a target Channel when submitting their manuscript, via the cover letter or the submission form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS believes that bringing communities together means research is shared more freely, and discoveries can be accelerated. If you’d like to discuss working with PLOS on a Channel for your community, email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:channels@plos.org&quot;&gt;channels@plos.org&lt;/a&gt; – we’d love to hear your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/sun-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is generally understood that vitamin D plays a role in exerting health benefits related to bone strength and condition. However, the significance of that role is not well understood. A number of misconceptions about vitamin D may have contributed to the ambiguity and should be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, vitamin D is not really a vitamin. Vitamins are essential nutrients that the human body is incapable of producing. As such, vitamins must be obtained through diet. Vitamin D, on the other hand, is produced in mammalian skin upon exposure to UV rays from the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, vitamin D is not &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; responsible for exerting health benefits related to bone strength. Instead, vitamin D is converted to a pre-hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, in the liver. This pre-hormone circulates in the blood and is measured to determine the vitamin D status of an individual. However, it (like vitamin D) is inactive under normal biological conditions. Conversion of the pre-hormone to the active hormone (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) takes place in the kidney. The biological effects of the active hormone (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) have been demonstrated at a number of cell and tissue sites, and its activity is strongly linked to calcium maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, many consumers and healthcare providers are either unaware or simply fail to acknowledge that vitamin D status (when determined via measurements of serum levels of the pre-hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D) does not necessarily correlate to the same health outcomes in all individuals. This underappreciated detail about vitamin D status was explored in depth in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12919-018-0102-4?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Proceedings-Public_Health-Global&amp;amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_MAY2018_Vitamin_D_paradox_Black_Americans&quot;&gt;The vitamin D paradox in Black Americans: a systems-based approach to investigating clinical practice, research, and public health – expert panel meeting report. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does the relationship between vitamin D status and bone health differ in various segments of the population? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies show that low measures of vitamin D status correlate to increased risk of osteopenia and fractures in White and Mexican-Americans, but measures of vitamin D status do not correlate to the same health outcomes in Black Americans. Despite markedly low measures of vitamin D status in Black Americans, the incidence of falls, fractures, or osteopenia are significantly lower compared to White American counterparts with similar vitamin D status. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12919-018-0102-4&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; describes discussions amongst expert panelists that revealed that Black Americans gain no skeletal benefits from high doses of vitamin D supplementation; and high levels of the current marker for vitamin D status are almost certain to result in adverse effects in this population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should Black Americans worry about low measures of vitamin D status?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many factors that affect vitamin D status and skeletal health in Black Americans. Data presented in the &lt;em&gt;BMC Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; report shows that adiposity, skin pigmentation, genetics, and environment all contribute to differences in vitamin D status with respect to skeletal health in Black Americans vs. White Americans; but no one factor could fully explain the significance of low measures of vitamin D status with respect to skeletal health in Black Americans. A better understanding of these factors may be key to understanding mechanisms for improving bone health in all populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do we go from here?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers and healthcare providers should appreciate the potential for adverse effects following over-supplementation with high doses of vitamin D in some individuals. While threshold values (deficient lower levels vs. safe upper levels) for individuals require further refinement, outcomes presented in the &lt;em&gt;BMC Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; report suggest that the Recommended Daily Allowance values (400-600 IU/day) should be appropriate for most healthy populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health scientists should appreciate the need to better understand the role of vitamin D and its significance in various segments of the population that are commonly underrepresented in clinical studies. A larger forum or workshop on the topic may help to stimulate more research on vitamin D with respect to bone health as well as implications beyond bone health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social class may seem different today than in the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century. Former British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott’s comment in 1997 that “we are all middle class now” had a ring of truth, given that most people in the West have access to what once were luxuries, such as running water, in-house entertainment, and eye-catching brands. But this is something of an illusion, according to Cardiff University’s Antony Manstead, who shows &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjso.12251&quot;&gt;in the &lt;i&gt;British Journal of Social Psychology &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(open access)&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;how class is still written into our psychology, and the implications this has for how we behave and our wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33886&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Manstead presents evidence that shows socio-economic status (based on income and educational attainment – not identical with class, but an overlapping concept that’s used in much of the relevant research) remains as important to people’s identity as factors like gender or ethnicity. This is truer for wealthier people than lower earners suggesting some eroding of a positive working-class identity.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from obvious class markers like clothing, our behaviour is also still a giveaway: lab studies show that working-class people are more likely to employ eye-contact, laughter and head nods when interacting with others, compared to a more disengaged non-verbal style from the middle/upper classes. And class can be read at greater than chance levels even from stimuli as basic as Facebook photographs or seven words of speech. So we feel a certain class, and others can detect that class fairly easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the psychological consequences of this awareness of social class? Manstead describes how working class people are more likely to consider the world as a mass of forces and risks to contend with and accommodate, which manifests in various ways including their measurably higher levels of vigilance and a heightened threat detection system. This makes sense if you lack some of the resources (e.g. rich parents) that can buffer you from catastrophe, but may also reflect limiting beliefs. Meanwhile, middle/upper-class people are more motivated by internal states and personal goals. They are more solipsistic, on average: the issue is how they should shape the world, not how it pushes back on them. This is indicated by a higher sense of perceived control, and more confidence that good things happen to people due to their choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For working class people, this approach to the world has personal downstream consequences, including a higher degree of fatalism towards serious life outcomes, such as contracting HIV. These attitudes&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;may also contribute to greater illness susceptibility: one study found that people exposed to a cold or flu virus and held in quarantine were more likely to become ill if they considered themselves as a lower status social class, even while controlling for their actual class and levels of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the costs of the middle and upper-class approach seem to be externalised on the society at large. Put bluntly, the research that Manstead amasses suggests that those with of a higher socioeconomic class are less empathic, have more favourable attitudes towards greed, and are more likely to lie in negotiations. Merely thinking about yourself as higher up the status ladder leads to more selfishness. One can see how a solipsistic view could lead to these attitudes. In contrast, the contextual, real-world focus of lower-class people leads to empathy and a greater ability to see how external events may be shaping the emotions of other people. In addition, they have a greater degree of interdependent relationships and higher levels of social engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think social mobility might bridge this psychological gap between the classes, sliding more socially-minded people into positions of influence. Higher education is meant to be one of the engines of social mobility, but people from lower social classes are more likely to report feeling like a fish out of water at university, or to perceive the opportunities available to them as second-rate. Although it ought to be possible to address these anxieties about the unfamiliar, research suggests that the culture of universities may not be designed with the working classes in mind. University deans and administrators asked to list qualities of their culture tended to endorse words more about independence – the natural state of the solipsistic upper-class person, charting their course into the future – than interdependence, which tends to be a particular priority for first-generation university goers, looking to give back to their community. Manstead notes that these same cultural factors are also likely to be present in many workforces and professions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So “the system” has a psychological component that helps maintain the status quo. Yet there is an appetite for change: in surveys of nationally representative samples, including the wealthy, people repeatedly express a preference for a more equal society. There is even some evidence that greater equality can flip some of the negative trends described about the middle and upper class, leading them to be more, rather than less generous in some economic tasks (perhaps because they feel less entitlement and sense of threat in a more equal society). And the good news is that studies show that giving people an accurate picture of their socioeconomic standing, or telling them that inequality is rising, leads them to being more receptive to change.&lt;/p&gt;
