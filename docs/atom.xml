 &lt;p&gt;We’re always evolving our services to make sharing discoveries as easy as possible for researchers. To help authors save time and effort in the article submission process, &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE, PLOS Biology, PLOS Medicine, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, PLOS Pathogens, PLOS Genetics,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; offer format-free initial submission for authors submitting research articles. Learn more about this service before you get started on your next submission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Format-Free Submission?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Format-free submission is part of our 3-step submission process which includes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial submission. &lt;/strong&gt;Participating journals waive all formatting requirements and will request formatting changes only after initial editorial evaluation or initial peer review depending on the journal. Simply upload your manuscript in a single PDF file (which can include text and figures) and submit to the journal’s online submission system. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editorial assessment. &lt;/strong&gt;Our editors and reviewers review and provide initial feedback on your submission as quickly as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full submission. &lt;/strong&gt;Make any additional formatting changes only after initial feedback is received. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, these 3 steps are designed to help ease initial submission so you spend as little time in the article submission process as possible. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lemon-frost-gecko-skin-cancer-tumors-genetics"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A gecko named Mr. Frosty and his kin have helped scientists uncover the genetic glitch that gives these lizards their standout color — and their high risk for skin tumors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The geckos are a variety of leopard gecko (&lt;em&gt;Eublepharis macularius&lt;/em&gt;) called Lemon Frost, which sports stark white skin that not only highlights its yellow coloring, but also tends to develop tumors. A new study &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1009580&quot;&gt;pegs these Lemon Frost traits to a single gene&lt;/a&gt; that has also been implicated in the skin cancer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eating-lot-fiber-could-improve-some-cancer-treatments&quot;&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt; in people (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/1/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that Lemon Frost geckos could be used to investigate new treatments for skin cancer, researchers report online June 24 in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was extremely exciting that they could link the Lemon Frost characteristics to a specific region of the genome,” says Ylenia Chiari, an evolutionary biologist at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., who wasn’t involved in the work. “Studying a gecko is not only about the gecko’s health or about understanding basic biology, but could also provide key information to further research on other organisms, including humans.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Over the last few decades, reptile breeders have produced a wide variety of leopard geckos, ranging from vibrant orange to black or spotted to striped. “It’s just amazing that one particular species can display such a variety of different colors and patterns,” says Longhua Guo, a geneticist at UCLA. Curious about the genetics underlying this rainbow of reptiles, Guo first visited a gecko breeding facility in California in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“It has shelves and shelves of cages, and you can hear crickets everywhere, because they feed these geckos crickets,” says Guo, who was immediately charmed by the colorful creatures. “They are very gentle and docile. You can hold them on your hand, and they just look at you with their big googly eyes, and their mouth always looks like they have on a big smile.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The owner of the facility, Steve Sykes, had bred a whole spectrum of leopard geckos. But he was particularly concerned about his Lemon Frost variety. After purchasing a Lemon Frost gecko named Mr. Frosty at a reptile auction, Sykes had bred Mr. Frosty with various female leopard geckos to establish a colony of more than 900 lizards. But more than 80 percent of the Lemon Frost geckos developed tumors made of white skin cells before the reptiles were 5 years old. In some geckos, the tumors grew into large bulges that could make it difficult for the animals to move and could get infected if ruptured.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;images of the undersides of a non-Lemon Frost gecko and two Lemon Frost geckos&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100773&quot; height=&quot;393&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/062321_MT_gecko_inline-1.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100773&quot;&gt;Unlike non–Lemon Frost geckos (left), lizards of the Lemon Frost variety tend to develop white skin tumors (black arrows) on their undersides (middle and right).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100773&quot;&gt;L. Guo &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/em&gt; 2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To uncover the gene responsible for the tumors, Guo and colleagues collected DNA from lizards’ saliva. The researchers deciphered the genetic makeup of about 30 geckos that inherited the Lemon Frost traits from both parents, over 100 others that inherited the traits from only one parent and nearly 40 non–Lemon Frost geckos. Comparing the genetic material of these geckos allowed the team to trace the Lemon Frost tumors and coloring to a mutation on a gene called &lt;em&gt;SPINT1&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This gene has not only been linked to cancer in humans, but also with tumor formation in fish and mice. This offers further evidence that &lt;em&gt;SPINT1&lt;/em&gt; is responsible for tumor growth in Lemon Frost geckos, says study coauthor Leonid Kruglyak, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator also at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the reptiles, the mutation may cause an overproduction of white skin cells, giving the geckos both their signature frosted appearance and liability to develop tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<updated>2021-06-24T18:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Excavations in an Israeli sinkhole have unveiled a previously unknown Stone Age hominid group that contributed to the evolution of the human genus, &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;. Inhabitants of a site called Nesher Ramla, who lived about 140,000 to 120,000 years ago, join Neandertals and Denisovans &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abh3169&quot;&gt;as a third Eurasian &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; population&lt;/a&gt; that culturally mingled with and possibly interbred with ancient &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hominid fossils previously excavated at three Israeli caves, &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abh3020&quot;&gt;which date to as early as around 420,000 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, probably also belong to the ancient population represented by the Nesher Ramla finds, says an international team led by paleoanthropologist Israel Hershkovitz.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers don’t assign a species name to what they call Nesher Ramla &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;. Genetic and cultural mixing of Eurasian &lt;em&gt;Homo &lt;/em&gt;groups during the Middle Pleistocene period — which ran from about 789,000 to 130,000 years ago — occurred too frequently to enable the evolution of a distinct species in this case, the team says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two studies in the June 25 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, one led by Hershkovitz, of Tel Aviv University, and the other led by archaeologist Yossi Zaidner of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, describe the new finds.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The fossils further complicate the human family tree, which has grown more complex in recent years with additions such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-suggest-new-species-human-genus&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;H. naledi &lt;/em&gt;from South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and the proposed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-hominid-species-homo-luzonensis-philippines&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;H. luzonensis&lt;/em&gt; from the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/10/15&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;SN: 4/10/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Nesher Ramla &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; was one of the last survivors of an ancient group of [hominids] that contributed to the evolution of European Neandertals and East Asian &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; populations,” Hershkovitz says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Work at Nesher Ramla uncovered five pieces of a braincase and a nearly complete lower jaw containing a molar tooth. These fossils in some ways resemble Neandertals and in others recall certain fossils often classified as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-teeth-push-human-neandertal-split-back-about-1-million-years-ago&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt;, a pre-Neandertal species&lt;/a&gt; thought to have occupied parts of Africa, Europe and possibly East Asia starting around 700,000 years ago (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/15/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the fossil-bearing sediment, Hershkovitz’s team excavated roughly 6,000 stone artifacts and several thousand bones of gazelles, horses, tortoises and other animals. Some of those bones contained stone-tool marks made during meat removal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;three stone tool artifacts&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100767&quot; height=&quot;379&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/062321_BB_israeli-sink-homo_inline-1.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100767&quot;&gt;Stone tools made by an ancient &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; population in the Middle East (shown) look like those fashioned around the same time by nearby &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, suggesting the two groups had close contacts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100767&quot;&gt;Tal Rogovski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Combinations of traits on some Chinese &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; fossils, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-child-fossil-jaw-east-asia-grew-teeth-modern-human&quot;&gt;a child’s jaw&lt;/a&gt; dating to possibly more than 200,000 years ago, resemble the look of the new Israeli fossils, Hershkovitz says (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/16/19&lt;/em&gt;). Ancient &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; groups with roots at Nesher Ramla may have reached East Asia and perhaps mated with some groups already living there, he speculates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Nesher Ramla &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; didn’t have to go as far as East Asia to interact with other hominid groups. Stone tools found with Nesher Ramla &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; fossils &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-jaw-pushes-humans-african-departure-back-time&quot;&gt;match implements of comparable age made from prepared chunks of rock by nearby &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/25/18).&lt;/em&gt; Nesher Ramla &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; must have exchanged stone-tool making knowledge, and possibly interbred, Hershkovitz says. Attempts to extract DNA from the Nesher Ramla fossils, which would reveal whether interbreeding took place, have failed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s intriguing that stone tools usually associated with &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; were found with such distinctive-looking fossils, says paleoanthropologist John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who did not participate in the new research. “That’s not a smoking gun proving there were close interactions between Nesher Ramla &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, but it’s very suggestive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evidence from Nesher Ramla fits a scenario in which the &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; genus evolved as closely related Middle Pleistocene populations and species, including Neandertals, Denisovans and &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abj3077&quot;&gt;Groups based in livable southern regions&lt;/a&gt; moved into much of Europe and Asia during relatively warm, wet stretches, writes paleoanthropologist Marta Mirazón Lahr of the University of Cambridge in a commentary published with the new studies. These ancient groups interbred, became fragmented, died out or recombined with other &lt;em&gt;Homo &lt;/em&gt;groups along the way, producing a variety of skeletal looks seen in European and East Asian &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; fossils, Lahr suggests.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dinosaurs didn’t just summer in the high Arctic; they may have lived there year-round, new fossil evidence suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of bones and teeth found along the Colville River in northern Alaska belonged to dinosaur hatchlings, researchers say. The remains, which fell from outcroppings of the Prince Creek Formation, represent seven dinosaur families including tyrannosaurs, duck-billed hadrosaurs and horned and frilled ceratopsids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These are the northernmost [non-avian] dinosaurs that we know of,” says paleontologist Patrick Druckenmiller of the University of Alaska Museum of the North in Fairbanks. And now it’s clear they’re not just migrating into polar latitudes, he says. “They’re actually nesting and laying and incubating eggs … practically at the North Pole.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of these dinosaurs incubated their eggs for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baby-dinosaurs-took-three-six-months-hatch&quot;&gt;up to six months&lt;/a&gt;, previous evidence suggests (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/23/17&lt;/em&gt;). That would have left little time for any &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.05.041&quot;&gt;dinos nesting in the Arctic&lt;/a&gt; to migrate south before winter set in, Druckenmiller and colleagues report online June 24 in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;. And any offspring would have struggled to make the long journey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;bones and teeth fossils of baby dinosaurs&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100758&quot; height=&quot;515&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/062321_NO_arctic-dinos_inline-1.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100758&quot;&gt;Hundreds of teeth and bones from baby dinosaurs, found in northern Alaska, are the best evidence yet that some dinosaurs nested and raised their young in the Arctic. Among the selection of remains shown are a tyrannosaur tooth (left), ceratopsid tooth (top left) and therapod bones (lower right).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100758&quot;&gt;Patrick Druckenmiller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Arctic was slightly warmer during the dinos’ lifetime than it is today. Between around 80 million and 60 million years ago, the region had an average annual temperature of about 6˚ Celsius — similar to that of modern-day Ottawa — fossilized plants from the Prince Creek Formation indicate. Still, overwintering dinosaurs would have endured months of darkness, cold temperatures and even snowfall, Druckenmiller says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They may have fought the cold with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/t-rex-has-another-fine-feathered-cousin&quot;&gt;insulating feathers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinos-straddled-line-between-cold-and-warm-blooded&quot;&gt;some degree of warm-bloodedness&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/4/12&lt;/em&gt;); &lt;em&gt;SN: 6/13/14)&lt;/em&gt;, and the herbivores may have hibernated or eaten rotten vegetation when fresh food diminished in the dark months, Druckenmiller speculates. Finding these baby dino fossils unearthed more questions than answers, he admits. “We’ve opened a whole can of worms.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Psychology is great at confirming — or challenging — all the old sayings. We’ve previously looked at studies examining whether it’s true that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/22/resolving-arguments-can-prevent-bad-feelings-from-lingering-and-we-get-better-at-it-as-we-age/&quot;&gt;you shouldn’t go to bed on an argument&lt;/a&gt;”, that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2010/01/27/time-flew-by-i-must-have-been-enjoying-myself/&quot;&gt;time flies when you’re having fun&lt;/a&gt;”, and that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/03/06/smarter-people-are-happier-says-new-analysis-involving-80000-participants-but-only-a-bit/&quot;&gt;ignorance is bliss&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/19485506211019923&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science &lt;/em&gt;has investigated whether “revenge is sweet”. Andreas B. Eder and colleagues at Julius-Maximilians-University of Würzburg find that people do seem to get something positive out of exacting revenge — but it can leave a bitter aftertaste too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42669&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some studies have found that retaliation can make the victim of a transgression feel better. But other work suggests that people overestimate how good revenge will make them feel, or that they actually end up feeling bad.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it does both, reasoned the authors of the new study: you might feel good straight after taking revenge, but the very act of retaliation could remind you of the original transgression and make you feel a bit miserable. If that’s the case, then you’d expect that “sweet” feeling to be an immediate, fleeting response, which might not show up if you just ask people about their feelings. So instead, the team decided to test people’s responses to enacting revenge using a more indirect measure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants played a game testing their reaction times, supposedly against two other players via the internet (unbeknownst to the participants, these other “players” weren’t real). Before each round, they had to nominate one of the other players to be blasted with noise if they won. But if they lost, they either received a sound blast themselves from the winning player, or saw the other losing player receive the sound blast. (In reality, who won or lost was determined solely by the computer). Crucially, one of the players picked on the participant when they won, usually blasting the participant with sound rather than the other player, while the other player didn’t show a preference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants also completed a “punishment” task. They saw images of the two other players with a border that quickly alternated between the two pictures, and had to hit a key when it highlighted the player they wanted to punish (again, with a loud noise). If participants were out for revenge, then presumably they would choose to punish the player who had been picking on them. But for a few of the trials — unknown to the participants – the computer made the decision for them, half the time choosing to punish the provoking player and half the time choosing the non-provoking player. These were the trials the researchers were interested in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, after each trial participants completed the “affect misattribution procedure”. This involves viewing a Chinese character and rating it as pleasant or unpleasant — it’s considered an indirect measure of how a participant is feeling at that point in time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that people were more likely to rate Chinese characters as pleasant after they punished the player who had been picking on them than after they punished the non-provoking player. But this was only true of participants who showed “revenge-seeking” behaviour (i.e. those who chose to blast the provoking player more often with noise). So the results suggested that revenge-seeking people do feel more positive after taking revenge against someone who has wronged them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But an alternative interpretation was that participants felt &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; after punishing the non-provoking player. To figure out whether this was the case, in a second study the team added an option to not punish either player. Revenge-seeking participants again rated the Chinese characters as more pleasant after punishing the provoking player compared to the non-provoking player. But, interestingly, their response was even &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;positive when no-one was punished.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results show that revenge “is neither wholly sweet nor wholly bitter”, the authors conclude. People generally feel bad after punishing someone, they write — but if they are taking revenge on a transgressor then they experience a certain amount of pleasure which counteracts some (but not all) of those bad feelings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are some obvious limitations to the study. As the authors note, it’s unclear exactly what processes are at play when rating Chinese characters (in fact, some researchers have argued that people’s responses on this test are not as “implicit” as assumed). And of course, transgressions and acts of revenge in real life are going to be very different from this artificial, lab-based task. Still, it’s an interesting piece of research that shows that our feelings and behaviours are far more nuanced than the old sayings imply.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;U.S. health officials will add a warning that the mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 could possibly cause rare cases of heart inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The largest-yet review of cases found a higher-than-expected incidence of the side effect, particularly in teen and young adult males. But the risk of the easily treatable heart issue is low and outweighed by the benefits of vaccination, Sara Oliver of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said June 23 after a presentation of the risks and protections offered by the mRNA vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, the data show that for every million second doses of vaccine given to boys ages 12 to 17, about 56 to 69 cases of heart inflammation are expected to arise. That makes them the group most at risk of the side effect.  But the shots could shield the boys from 5,700 cases of COVID-19 and its complications, including 215 hospitalizations, 71 intensive care admissions and two deaths. Girls in that age group have a much lower risk — 8 to 10 instances per 1 million second doses — but vaccination could avert 8,500 cases of COVID-19, 183 hospitalizations, 38 ICU admissions and one death.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Vaccination may also prevent long-term symptoms, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-kids-complications-inflammation-rare-cases&quot;&gt;a hyper-inflammatory condition called MIS-C&lt;/a&gt;, which strikes an estimated 1 of every 3,200 children infected with SARS-CoV-2 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/12/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The decision to add a warning came after the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices discussed cases of two kinds of heart inflammation among young people shortly after they got vaccinated: myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, inflammation of the lining of the heart. The possible side effects were first noticed in Israel, but other countries, including the United States, have found cases of the heart problems, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Viral infections, including coronavirus infections, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-vaccine-side-effects-coronavirus-myocarditis&quot;&gt;may cause the heart inflammation&lt;/a&gt; as a side effect of the immune system’s efforts to fight the virus (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/1/21&lt;/em&gt;). Because vaccines also stir up the immune system, some vaccines have also been linked to heart inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of June 11, after 133 million second mRNA vaccine doses, 636 cases of myocarditis had been reported to VAERS, a U.S. database to which anyone can report side effects, regardless of whether those side effects are caused by a vaccine. The CDC used those data and others to calculate potential harms and benefits of getting an mRNA vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on how many cases of myocarditis and pericarditis that would be expected in young people, the number of reported cases was higher than expected for 12- to 39-year-olds, the researchers found. Males were more likely than females to develop heart inflammation, and the issue arose more often after the second dose of vaccine than after the first dose. And the effect was more obvious in younger people, said Tom Shimabukuro of the CDC’s COVID-19 vaccine task force. “This effect largely disappears when you get into these older age groups, individuals 50 and older,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Increased risk&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CDC researchers calculated how many cases of heart inflammation they would expect to see based on published rates of the conditions. The number of cases actually reported, especially after a second dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, was higher than expected for younger people, particularly young men and boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: ACIP/CDC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, 12.6 cases of heart inflammation were found for every million second dose of an mRNA vaccine given to 12- to 39-year-olds, Shimabukuro reported. Moderna’s vaccine was associated with 19.8 cases per million second doses, while Pfizer’s vaccine was linked to 8 cases per million second doses in those age groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why the Moderna vaccine would produce more cases of heart inflammation than the Pfizer vaccine is not clear. Moderna’s vaccine is currently authorized for people 18 and older, so any myocarditis or pericarditis cases noted in 12- to 17-year-olds are mostly from the Pfizer vaccine or from clinical trials in teens and tweens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the benefits still trump the risk, the CDC’s Megan Wallace reported. Even as overall cases of COVID-19 are declining in the United States, the share cases in younger people is growing. In May, about a third were among 12- to 29-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While young people are less likely to have severe disease and die of COVID-19 than older people, they may still get very ill, suffer serious complications and even die. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 2,767 people in the United States 12- to 29-years-old have died of COVID-19. That includes 316 deaths in that age group since April 1.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Besides the findings for 12- to 17-year-olds, the analysis also showed that for every million second doses of vaccine given to 18- to 24-year-olds, officials expect four to five cases of myocarditis in females and 45 to 56 cases among males. In that age group, vaccination is expected to prevent:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;14,000 cases of COVID-19 in females and 12,000 cases in males;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1,127 hospitalizations for females and 530 for males;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;93 intensive care admissions for females and 127 for males;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and 13 deaths among women and three for men.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the older age group, the benefit becomes even more clear. Two cases of myocarditis in women and 15 to 18 cases in men ages 24- to 29-years old are expected for every million second doses of an mRNA vaccine given. But the vaccines could prevent:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;15,000 cases of COVID-19 in females and an equal number in males;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1,459 hospitalizations of females and 936 of males;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;87 intensive care admissions in females and 215 in males;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and four deaths in females and 13 deaths in males.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those calculations could change if there is a dramatic decline or rise in cases, Wallace said. But as a result of the data, officials from CDC and the Food and Drug Administration said they would continue to recommend vaccination against COVID-19 for young people.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Wild Chinese mountain cats aren’t the ancestors of domestic cats, but the two types of felines still swap genes. The wildcats’ DNA is inscribed on the genes of some pet cats living on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, but the mixing of genetic material extends back only a couple dozen generations, researchers report online June 23 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-trumps-near-east-signs-most-ancient-farm-cats&quot;&gt;Cats and humans have lived together&lt;/a&gt; in China for at least 5,300 years, yet previous genetic studies on feline domestication hadn’t included DNA from East Asian cats (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/17/13&lt;/em&gt;). So researchers wondered whether the mountain cats (&lt;em&gt;Felis silvestris bieti or Felis bieti&lt;/em&gt;) had ever contributed to Chinese pets’ genes. Yes, the team found, but the short length of time mountain cats and housecats have been mating suggests Chinese domestic cats have their origins elsewhere, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-reveals-how-cats-achieved-world-domination&quot;&gt;probably in the Middle East&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/19/17&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shu-Jin Luo, a geneticist at Peking University in Beijing, and her colleagues came to that conclusion after they compared DNA from 27 Chinese mountain cats, 239 Chinese domestic cats and four Asiatic wildcats. The researchers didn’t encounter the elusive Chinese mountain cats in the wild; instead, they took samples from museum pelts, roadkill carcasses and zoo animals. The team did collect samples from the house cats, however. Rural Chinese cats come and go as they please, so “Oh, he’s not home yet, so we’ll wait for [an] hour” became a familiar refrain, Luo recalls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Analysis showed that the pet cats’ DNA carried traces of mountain cat genetics up to 30 generations ago. The reason is “actually quite apparent, but nobody thought about it before,” Luo says. Domestic cats arrived on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in the 1950s, most likely brought there by Han Chinese migrants. Census data show human population spikes in the region 70 years ago, coinciding with the earliest signs of hybridization of the wild and domestic cats, Luo says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;wild-domestic cat hybrid&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100719&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/062321_JC_mountain-cat_inline-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100719&quot;&gt;Most wild-domestic cat hybrids (one shown) have no outward signs of mountain cat genes lurking in their DNA. But subtle ear tufts hint at this pet’s wildcat heritage — and his DNA confirmed it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100719&quot;&gt;Meng Hao&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pet cats’ Y chromosomes hold clues about these encounters, carrying genes that can enter the gene pool only through mountain cat fathers. Male Chinese mountain cats seem to sneak into villages and mate with female housecats, not the other way around, Luo says. But her team isn’t just looking at the cats’ genetics to understand their history. In Scotland, the genetic distinctiveness of European wildcats has been nearly wiped out by breeding with feral cats. Luo and her colleagues suspected they might find similar effects in Chinese mountain cats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team didn’t detect domestic cats infiltrating mountain cat populations. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t happening. With more DNA samples, future work may reveal genes are already flowing both ways. “I’m not convinced that this is going in only one direction,” says Eva-Maria Geigl, a paleogeneticist at CNRS in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modern interbreeding could threaten Chinese mountain cat conservation in the long run. Domestic cats’ genes could dilute or override traits that make mountain cats well adapted to high altitudes, Luo says.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;When the Utah Symphony performed this spring, its arrangements struck a new note. The percussion instruments, harp and piano had moved from the back of the stage to nearer the center. Trumpets, flutes and other woodwind and brass instruments relocated from the center to the fringes, closest to the onstage air vents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Along with opening as many doors and windows as possible, that setup can greatly&lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/26/eabg4511&quot;&gt; reduce musicians’ risk of exposure to airborne diseases&lt;/a&gt; such as COVID-19, researchers report June 23 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simulations of air dynamics in a concert hall show that these changes can reduce the accumulation of potentially infectious airborne particles by about 100 times — lowering concentrations from around 0.01–1 particle per liter of air across most of the stage to under 0.001 particles per liter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;





&lt;p&gt;As performers return to stages, some activities pose unique challenges. Like singing, playing certain instruments can spew &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-6-feet-may-not-be-enough-social-distance&quot;&gt;droplets&lt;/a&gt; from a musician’s breath (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/17/20&lt;/em&gt;). Potentially virus-laden droplets can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration&quot;&gt;linger in the air&lt;/a&gt;, spreading disease (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/18/21&lt;/em&gt;). While string players and percussionists may wear masks to reduce virus spread, brass and woodwind musicians are “manufacturers of respiratory droplets,” says Tony Saad, a chemical engineer at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Saad’s team relied on air flow modeling — based on past measurements of potentially infectious particles emitted by typical orchestra instruments — to determine how air moves across a stage and which adjustments would best protect an ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But how do those changes make the music sound to an audience? Not unfamiliar, says coauthor James Sutherland, also a chemical engineer at the University of Utah. The change is more jarring for the conductor and musicians onstage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the Salt Lake City–based ensemble — which collaborated with the researchers — used the study’s recommendations as a blueprint for the spring performance season. “If this is what they need to do to get back to performing safely, then it’s a small price to pay,” Sutherland says.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Astronomers look for distant planets by watching for the shadow the worlds cast when passing between their star and Earth. If any aliens are searching for other intelligent life, they could spot us using the same trick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, scientists have identified 1,715 star systems whose hypothetical inhabitants &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03596-y&quot;&gt;could have seen Earth cross in front of the sun sometime in the last 5,000 years&lt;/a&gt;. Another 319 stars will come into the right positions for spotting Earth in the next 5,000 years, astrophysicist Jackie Faherty and astronomer Lisa Kaltenegger report in the June 23 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those 2,034 stars had or will have “the front row seat to finding Earth as a transiting planet,” says Faherty, of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seventy-five of the stars are close enough that human-made radio waves have already reached them, and seven of those stars have potentially habitable planets.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Faherty and Kaltenegger, of Cornell University, used maps of more than 1 billion stars from the European Space Agency’s Gaia spacecraft, which measures stars’ movements and distances from Earth. The researchers identified the Earth transit zone, the region of space from which stars can see Earth cross the sun, and ran the clock backward and forward to see stars move in and out of that zone. “The way I think about this is, ‘Where are &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; the aliens?’” Kaltenegger says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous research &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/find-et-look-who-maybe-looking-us&quot;&gt;identified stars that can currently see Earth silhouetted against the sun&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/20/16&lt;/em&gt;). But those studies did not take into account stellar movements through space and time. The new work shows that most star systems with a good look at Earth will keep that view for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The newly described stellar collection includes some of the nearest and most well-known stars with planets, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/7222/ross-128-b/&quot;&gt;Ross 128&lt;/a&gt; and TRAPPIST-1, with its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seven-earth-sized-planets-orbit-nearby-supercool-star&quot;&gt;septet of rocky worlds&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/22/17&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;As India reels from a devastating second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, a new horror is plaguing people there. Some COVID-19 patients “go home only to come back to the hospital with a damaged nose, swollen cheeks and so on,” says SP Kalantri, a physician at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences in Sevagram, a small town in the state of Maharashtra.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cases aren’t unique to Kalantri’s hospital. Medical facilities across the country are seeing a surge in people who have recovered from COVID-19 and are now being preyed upon by a rare fungal infection called mucormycosis. The fungus can invade the nasal cavity and the sinuses and, in some cases, even reach the brain, turning the affected areas black. Colloquially dubbed black fungus, an infection can maim patients, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/9/21-0934_article&quot;&gt;kills up to half of those who contract it&lt;/a&gt;, researchers reported June 4 in &lt;em&gt;Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since April, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1725061&quot;&gt;mucormycosis infections have skyrocketed&lt;/a&gt; across India; more than 28,000 cases had been officially&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1725061&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;reported as of June 7. Of those, 86 percent were COVID-19 patients. Local media reports in India now estimate that as of June 11, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/black-fungus-cases-grow-150-in-3-weeks-to-31-000-deaths-over-2-100-2461502&quot;&gt;cases had reached more than 31,000&lt;/a&gt;. At St. John’s Medical College Hospital in Bangalore, “in the pre-COVID period, we had approximately 30 patients per year” with the infection, says Sanjiv Lewin, chief of medical services. But in a recent two-week period, “we had a sudden surge of 63 patients.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;





&lt;p&gt;People with COVID-19, especially those that end up in an intensive care unit, already are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0255085720300177#bib4&quot;&gt;vulnerable to secondary infections&lt;/a&gt;. Other countries have reported a smattering of post–COVID-19 fungal infections, including Oman, which on June 15 reported its first mucormycosis infections in COVID-19 patients. “There have been some cases reported in the United States, but they have been very few,” says Stuart Levitz, an attending physician at the University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center in Worcester. However, no country matches the sheer number of black fungus cases being reported in India right now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s how a perfect storm of conditions came together to create the country’s rash of black fungus infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Fungus among us      &lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mucorales, the group of fungi that includes molds responsible for mucormycosis, is ubiquitous in hot and humid climates like India. So even before the pandemic, the estimated rate of these fungal infections was much higher in India than any place else in the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The environment has such amount of spore, that when you give it a fertile ground, it becomes a problem,” says Arunaloke Chakrabarti, a medical mycologist at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education &amp;amp; Research in Chandigarh, India.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;India typically has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdpi.com/2309-608X/5/1/26/htm&quot;&gt;140 cases of mucormycosis per million people&lt;/a&gt;, he and a colleague estimated in a March 2019 study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Fungi&lt;/em&gt;. “That’s 70 times that of the Western world,” Chakrabarti says. In comparison, there are about 3 cases per million people in the United States, the researchers estimated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the ubiquity of these fungal spores in India, infections among healthy individuals are quite rare. But here’s where other factors of this perfect storm come into play.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;microscope images of Rhizopus arrhizus spores&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100691&quot; height=&quot;448&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061821_PP_india-fungus_inline-2_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100691&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Rhizopus arrhizus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;one of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;the molds responsible for often deadly “black fungus” infections, is ubiquitous in warm climates like India. For healthy people, it’s usually innocuous, but it can wreak havoc on people with a compromised immune system, such as COVID-19 patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100691&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dr. Hardin/CDC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Fertile ground&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/mmy/article-abstract/57/4/395/5063412&quot;&gt;uncontrolled diabetes&lt;/a&gt; are at a high risk of contracting the fungal infection, studies have shown. That’s because as blood sugar levels spike, the pH of blood turns acidic, creating a favorable environment for the fungus to thrive. Diabetes “overshadows all the other risk factors,” Chakrabarti says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given India’s reputation as the diabetes capital of the world — with an estimated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diabetesatlas.org/en/sections/demographic-and-geographic-outline.html&quot;&gt;77 million diabetics&lt;/a&gt; — that’s bad news. “Every eighth person admitted to the hospital either [has] diabetes or developed high blood glucose during the hospital stay,” Kalantri says.      &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So India already was a fertile ground for mucormycosis infections. Then the pandemic hit. Desperate for treatments, doctors and families have scrambled to get patients one of the few treatments for COVID-19: steroids. Studies have shown drugs such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-steroids-reduce-deaths-covid19-patients-who&quot;&gt;dexamethasone can reduce the risk of death&lt;/a&gt; for severely ill COVID-19 patients (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/2/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “The recommendation is very clear and crisp: eight milligrams of dexamethasone only for 10 days and only in hypoxic patients,” Kalantri says. When administered at the correct time and in the right dosage, steroids can save lives by dampening the overreacting immune system and preventing inflammation in the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But given too early in an infection, when the body is trying to fight off the coronavirus by itself, steroids can be counterproductive and can hamper the body’s ability to rein in infections, leaving it vulnerable to other secondary infections. Desperation during India’s second surge of the pandemic has led to excessive and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-india-crisis-social-distancing-masks-variant&quot;&gt;indiscriminate use of the drug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-india-crisis-social-distancing-masks-variant&quot;&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;, which can be bought over the counter (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/9/21&lt;/em&gt;). “The message that went through the media to the lay public as well as to the regular doctor is probably that steroids are the only thing which helps, so as soon as they made a diagnosis of COVID, they gave steroids,” Lewin says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that exacerbated the risk for fungal infections. “Gross and irrational abuse of steroids and high glucose levels created a perfect milieu for the fungus to grow, thrive and destroy the tissues,” Kalantri says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A July 2021 &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/ijo/Fulltext/2021/07000/Epidemiology,_clinical_profile,_management,_and.10.aspx&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Indian Journal of Ophthalmology &lt;/em&gt;that looked at 2,826 mucormycosis patients in India supports that conclusion. The research found &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/ijo/Fulltext/2021/07000/Epidemiology,_clinical_profile,_management,_and.10.aspx&quot;&gt;diabetes and the use of steroids&lt;/a&gt; to be the “most important predisposing factors” for developing post–COVID-19 black fungus infections. Still, Kalantri says, “this isn’t the entire story.”      &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, the novel coronavirus has been&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-021-00347-1&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-021-00347-1&quot;&gt;implicated in affecting insulin production&lt;/a&gt;, researchers reported February 3 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;. “COVID virus itself damages the beta cell of the pancreas, which then hinders insulin production … so the blood sugar goes further high,” Chakrabarti says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, several experts have also pointed that the rampant use of antibiotics in general could have helped the fungus gain entry. “By getting rid of bacterial flora in the sinuses and the nasal cavity, if the fungi that cause mucormycosis gets into the sinuses, you don’t have competition from the bacteria and so it may help the fungus gain a foothold,” Levitz says.    &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, it is difficult to pinpoint all of the factors responsible for India’s rising fungal infections. But the ongoing crisis provides an opportunity for epidemiological investigations to find answers and hopefully help in preventing future outbreaks. In the meantime, doctors are scrambling to do whatever they can to help people suffering now.&lt;/p&gt;

A multi-specialty team including ophthalmologists and ear, nose and throat surgeons is often required to treat the infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100690&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ajit Solanki/AP Photo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Treatment troubles&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that, while a black fungus infection can be deadly, treatments do exist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Liposomal amphotericin B, the primary drug used for treatment, can stop the fungus from growing and spreading to other tissues, and surgery can remove the affected tissue. But getting this treatment underway hinges on a timely diagnosis, which can be difficult to make in a resource-starved setting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, because of the infection’s ability to affect numerous types of tissue, “you need multi-specialty teams of ophthalmologists, [ear, nose and throat] surgeons, physicians, with a neurosurgeon on standby,” Lewin says. In an already overwhelmed health care system, a team like that can be difficult to assemble. And the antifungal drug is now also hard to come by as demand has swiftly outpaced supply. Even if the drug is available in the open market, it is extremely cost-prohibitive for most Indians.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You have to spend 30,000 rupees [the equivalent of $400] a day on the drug alone, and it doesn’t include the cost of hospitalization, CT scans, surgery, monitoring, etcetera…. Ninety-nine percent of Indians won’t be able to afford that,” Kalantri says. Even in sophisticated, tertiary-care hospitals, the situation is bleak. “I have six ampules of amphotericin B presently with me. Six! And I’ve got presently 36 patients in my ward,” Lewin says. “Without amphotericin, I am in deep trouble because the infection will continue to spread, blind my patients, even kill my patients.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While new cases of COVID-19 in India have dropped from their peak in May &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1728702&quot;&gt;to about 60,000 a day now&lt;/a&gt;, fungal infections continue to add up. But there is some hope. For one, the Indian government has stepped in to ramp up domestic production of liposomal amphotericin B and to facilitate importation of the drug. One doctor &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raghurajs_hegde/status/1399765485919502338&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “Last couple of days, few of our patients getting their full dose. So something seems to be working for now.” The long-term hope, however, hinges on ending the COVID-19 pandemic, in whose shadow the fungus has thrived.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3100679</id>
		<updated>2021-06-22T16:27:45+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Moons do it, stars do it, even whole galaxies do it. Now, two teams of scientists say cosmic filaments do it, too. These tendrils stretching hundreds of millions of light-years spin, twirling like giant corkscrews.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cosmic filaments are the universe’s largest known structures and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/filament-cosmic-web-set-aglow&quot;&gt;contain most of the universe’s mass&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/20/14&lt;/em&gt;). These &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-filament-illuminated&quot;&gt;dense, slender strands of dark matter and galaxies connect the cosmic web&lt;/a&gt;, channeling matter toward galaxy clusters at each strand’s end (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/5/12&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the instant of the Big Bang, matter didn’t rotate; then, as stars and galaxies formed, they began to spin. Until now, galaxy clusters were the largest structures known to rotate. “Conventional thinking on the subject said that’s where spin ends. You can’t really generate torques on larger scales,” says Noam Libeskind, cosmologist at the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;So the discovery that filaments spin — at a scale that makes galaxies look like specks of dust — presents a puzzle. “We don’t have a full theory of how every galaxy comes to rotate, or every filament comes to rotate,” says Mark Neyrinck, cosmologist at University of the Basque Country in Bilbao, Spain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test for rotation, Neyrinck and colleagues used a 3-D cosmological simulation to measure the velocities of &lt;a data-id=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02418v2&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02418v2&quot;&gt;dark matter clumps&lt;/a&gt; as the clumps moved around a filament. He and his colleagues describe their results in a paper posted in 2020 at arXiv.org and now in press with the &lt;em&gt;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&lt;/em&gt;. Meanwhile, Libeskind and colleagues searched for rotation in the real universe, they report June 14 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Astronomy&lt;/em&gt;. Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01380-6&quot;&gt;mapped galaxies’ motions&lt;/a&gt; and measured their velocities perpendicular to filaments’ axes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;A computer simulation shows how a cosmic filament twists galaxies and dark matter into a strand of the cosmic web. Filaments pull matter into rotation and toward clusters at their ends, visualized here with “test particles” shaped like comets.  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two teams detected similar rotational velocities for filaments despite differing approaches, Neyrinck says, an “encouraging [indication] that we’re looking at the same thing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, researchers want to tackle what makes these giant space structures spin, and how they get started. “What is that process?” Libeskind says. “Can we figure it out?”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fathom-movie-humpback-whale-researchers-songs-calls"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3100545</id>
		<updated>2021-06-22T15:49:48+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;In an opening scene of the new film &lt;em&gt;Fathom&lt;/em&gt;, Michelle Fournet sits at her computer in the dark, headphones on. The marine ecologist at Cornell University is listening to a humpback whale song, her fingers bobbing like a conductor’s to each otherworldly croak and whine. Software converts crooning whale sounds into the visual space of craggy valleys and tall peaks, offering a glimpse at a language millions of years in the making.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Debuting June 25 on Apple TV+, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/fathom/umc.cmc.5dba56sgwst50iuh5h9uqpdsq&quot;&gt;Fathom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; follows two scientific teams studying the enigmatic songs of humpbacks. The film captivates, diving into the quest to unveil the inner world of these animals and their ever-changing song culture — one considered far older than our ancestors’ first upright steps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean, scientists head out onto the water. In a mountain-fringed bay in Alaska, Fournet makes repeated attempts to talk to the whales, playing them a painstakingly reconstructed rendition of a yelp that she thinks may be a greeting. In French Polynesia, behavioral ecologist Ellen Garland of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland listens to humpback songs, mapping how they are tweaked, learned and shared by whales across the South Pacific. These settings are stark and gorgeous, their isolation artfully shown through silent, foggy mornings and endless cobalt seas. In a film fundamentally about oceans filled with sound, ample quiet rests on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Directed by Drew Xanthopoulos, &lt;em&gt;Fathom &lt;/em&gt;portrays humpbacks and other whales as complex, highly social beings without overstated anthropomorphism. In one goose bump–inducing scene, Garland’s narration identifies whales’ social similarities to humans, but set in a totally different environment. Perceiving each other chiefly with sound cast over stupefying distances, “whales evolved to build relationships in the dark,” Garland says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/fathom/umc.cmc.5dba56sgwst50iuh5h9uqpdsq&quot;&gt;Fathom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Premieres June 25&lt;br /&gt;Apple TV+&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fathom&lt;/em&gt; also gives an intimate look at what scientists undertake to find humpbacks in the vast ocean. Equipment breaks. Whales prove unpredictable. Strategies must change on the fly. These moments communicate the tough realities of science and the resilience needed for successful research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Much of the film is immersed in scenes like these, between troubleshooting and long waits on boat surveys. At times, the film’s pace languishes; connections to greater perspectives, such as the possibility of a globally interlinked song culture, are touched on but not fully examined.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Fournet’s simple distillation of her complex quest lingers: “I’m trying to start a conversation.” Her words remind us that &lt;em&gt;Fathom&lt;/em&gt; is inherently seated at the threshold of unfathomable territory. &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across the world, birth rates are dropping. The global fertility rate &lt;a href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate&quot;&gt;has halved since 1950&lt;/a&gt;, with indications that this will continue to fall. There are a number of suggestions as to why this is the case: women may stay in education or the workforce rather than have multiple children, for instance, and many people across the world now have much greater access to contraception.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But many adults are also explicitly deciding not to have children, instead choosing to be “childfree”. The childfree movement has grown rapidly over the last few years: the ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://reddit.com/r/childfree&quot;&gt;r/Childfree&lt;/a&gt;’ subreddit has over 1.4 million subscribers, whilst &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/childfree&quot;&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/fertility-women-over-30-child-free-life-lessons/474526&quot;&gt;coverage&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,2148636,00.html&quot;&gt;proliferated&lt;/a&gt; in the UK and US.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But are the childfree missing out on the joys that come from parenthood? According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0252528&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;, that isn’t the case: childfree adults are just as satisfied with their lives as parents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42647&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants, 1000 adults from Michigan in the United States, were either parents, child&lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; (had no children but wanted them) or child&lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; (had no children and didn’t want them). They completed several scales, including measures of life satisfaction and of the Big Five personality traits, before rating on a scale from 0 to 100 how cold or warm they felt towards both women and men who do not ever want to have biological or adopted children. Finally, the team also collected demographic data, including information on participants’ race, gender, education, age, political ideology and relationship status — whether someone was partnered, formerly partnered (e.g. divorced, separated or widowed) or single.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over a quarter of participants were childfree, the second biggest group after parents. At first, it appeared that childfree participants had lower life satisfaction than parents — but this difference disappeared after controlling for gender, education, age and relationship status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Childfree participants were also more likely to be left-wing or liberal compared to parents. “Not yet parents” — those who did not have children yet but hoped to in the future — were slightly more agreeable than childfree participants, but there were no other differences in personality between the groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Warmness towards childfree women and men also depended on the parenting status of participants. Childfree people felt warmer towards childfree women and men while childless individuals and parents felt significantly colder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A common refrain on forums such as r/Childfree is that many parents insinuate — or say outright — that their childfree counterparts couldn’t possibly be as happy as them. This research seems to suggest that isn’t the case. However, despite the fact that childfree adults are just as satisfied with their lives as parents, they are still considered by others to be an outgroup, with parents and childless individuals feeling significantly colder towards them than other childfree people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further research could look at the variety of reasons why people choose not to have children: in this study, personality didn’t seem to make much of a difference while political ideology did, so exploring the direction of this effect may be interesting. Whether it’s to do with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/08/why-i-dont-have-a-child-i-dont-have-enough-money&quot;&gt;finances&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/give-up-having-children-couples-save-planet-climate-crisis&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/a&gt;, or gender roles, looking more closely at the political, economic and social factors that lead people to becoming childfree could give insight into the complex components of the decision to have — or not have — children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0252528&quot;&gt;Prevalence and characteristics of childfree adults in Michigan (USA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;90&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/logo-bmcproc-pr-140x90.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greater inclusion of individuals from underrepresented demographics in STEM fields has long been a goal for many disciplines. As the culture of STEM evolves towards greater inclusivity, providing equitable access to talented individuals of all backgrounds has become a key priority. Diversity not only in academic expertise but in demographics is increasingly recognized as a source of collective strength that correlates with success and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific societies have historically sought to cultivate diverse membership through an educational model that supports scientist participation in activities that prepare them for upcoming career transitions. While this methodology is broadly applied across many different disciplines, societies are now coordinating their efforts and using data to evaluate outcomes and identify &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lifescied.org/doi/full/10.1187/cbe.19-11-0262&quot;&gt;opportunities&lt;/a&gt; to improve impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process, scientific societies have found themselves well-suited to offer field-specific career development opportunities that complement the traditional instruction and training provided at academic institutions. Trainees in the process of developing into independent academic scientists must cultivate a combination of disciplinary knowledge and complementary soft skills in order to navigate demands such as grant-writing, collaboration, mentoring, and publishing—skills that are fundamental to success in the professoriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from backgrounds that are underrepresented in STEM are less likely to have access to mentoring, making it more challenging to develop the soft skills necessary to facilitate success as tenure-track faculty. Scientific society professional development programming geared towards these scientists can have an equalizer effect, enabling them to successfully build their academic niche and professorial career in field areas of interest to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;BioMed Central&lt;/a&gt; (BMC) such as science, technology, engineering and medicine. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jmbe.v21i1.1941&quot;&gt;Minorities Affairs Committee (MAC) of the American Society for Cell Biology&lt;/a&gt; (ASCB) has a strong track record of creating professional development programs to help relieve these disparities in access to mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of ASCB MAC programming is its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ascb.org/career-development/2021-accomplishing-career-transitions-act-program/&quot;&gt;Accomplishing Career Transitions (ACT) program&lt;/a&gt;. ACT engages cell biologists who are starting out their independent careers to individualize their professional development and training through a longitudinal mentoring framework. ASCB aims to prepare ACT Fellows for a successful transition into the academic STEM workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new BMC Proceedings Supplement, highlights topics including effective mentorship, obtaining a faculty position, starting a lab, preparing for tenure and promotion, and professional development through experiential learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of this BMC Proceedings Supplement is more important now than ever, as rising faculty adapt their career trajectories to global challenges. Our short term goal with this &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-15-supplement-2&quot;&gt;BMC Proceedings Supplement&lt;/a&gt; is to make the ACT program available to a wider range of  scientists to help them prepare for success in academia. Their success will contribute to a diverse professoriate that is inclusive and welcoming of the next generation of scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The Manhattan Project brought together the finest scientific minds in the United States for one urgent purpose: to build an atomic bomb. That included people who had historically been marginalized, including Black scientists, who achieved greatness in an era of rampant discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of those minds was J. Ernest Wilkins Jr., a Black mathematician, nuclear scientist and optics researcher. Barely past his teen years as the Manhattan Project ramped up, he quickly began working with the top physicists of the time on what was perhaps the most consequential physics research project of the century.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Born in Chicago in 1923, Wilkins was a math prodigy. He was one of the youngest students ever admitted to the University of Chicago — at age 13. He earned his Ph.D. at the university by the time he was 19, in 1942. His academic feats were so impressive that newspaper articles proclaimed him a genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate our upcoming 100th anniversary, we’re launching a series that highlights some of the biggest advances in science over the last century.

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Soon, Wilkins began working in the university’s Metallurgical Laboratory, where much more was afoot than mundane studies of metals. Researchers there were helping design nuclear reactors to produce the plutonium needed to create an atomic bomb. With physicist Eugene Wigner, Wilkins began laying the theoretical physics groundwork for nuclear reactors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a nuclear reactor, energy is released when uranium atoms fission, or split, after being hit by a neutron. Each fission also releases additional neutrons, which bounce around within the reactor at a variety of energies. Wigner and Wilkins’ work on determining the &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-77425-6_33&quot;&gt;energy distribution of such neutrons&lt;/a&gt; is a foundation of nuclear physics, still cited by researchers today. Those neutrons go on to initiate more fissions, producing a chain reaction, so understanding their energies is crucial for designing reactors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in 1944, when Wilkins’ colleagues were scheduled to move to a Manhattan Project site in Oak Ridge, Tenn., Wilkins stayed behind. The state’s racist laws enforcing segregation in businesses, schools and workplaces would have meant unbearable indignities for the young man. “It’s not that he couldn’t go. He refused to go,” says Ronald Mickens, a scientist and colleague of Wilkins during his later years at Clark Atlanta University in Georgia. “He would not allow, and certainly his family would not allow him to live in segregated quarters.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;black and white illustration of a pile of graphite and uranium&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100504&quot; height=&quot;508&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/031821_ec_cos-atoms-spotlight-wilkins_inline1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100504&quot;&gt;Wilkins worked at the University of Chicago’s Metallurgical Laboratory, where in 1942 physicists had created the first self-sustaining, controlled nuclear chain reaction, in a pile of graphite and uranium (illustrated).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100504&quot;&gt;U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Public Affairs, National Archives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, Wilkins’ skills were in high demand during the Manhattan Project. In 1944, physicist Edward Teller, who later became known as the father of the hydrogen bomb, noted that “[M]en of high qualifications are scarce these days,” and recommended Wilkins to Harold Urey of Columbia University, saying that he “has been doing, according to Wigner, excellent work.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wilkins, however, stayed at the University of Chicago until 1946. He signed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atomicheritage.org/key-documents/szilard-petition&quot;&gt;Szilard Petition&lt;/a&gt;, a letter from 70 scientists to President Harry Truman after the defeat of Germany in World War II, which urged that Japan be given an opportunity to surrender before any atomic bombs were used. The petition never reached Truman.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wilkins remained a prominent figure in the nuclear physics community throughout his career, serving as president of the American Nuclear Society in 1974–75. According to a 1974 profile in &lt;em&gt;Nuclear News&lt;/em&gt;, Wilkins was known for “his quick intelligence, … his directness and good nature.” He delved deeply into complex topics related to nuclear reactors, including how gamma rays, a type of radiation produced in reactors, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.89.1150&quot;&gt;penetrate through materials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;After working in the nuclear industry for several decades, Wilkins became a professor at Howard University in Washington, D.C., in 1970, where he helped establish the first mathematics Ph.D. program at a historically Black university. In the 1990s, he joined Clark Atlanta University in Georgia. He died in 2011 at age 87.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite his focus on nuclear physics, Wilkins had wide-ranging curiosity and tackled diverse mathematical questions. He also tackled topics in optics; early in his career he designed lenses for microscopes and other devices. He even studied the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2037860?seq=1&quot;&gt;mathematics of gambling&lt;/a&gt;, with a paper titled “The Bold Strategy in Presence of House Limit,” which he presented, appropriately, in Las Vegas, at the 1972 meeting of the American Mathematical Society.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you have a mathematics background … what you find is that the same mathematics, the same structures, show up in many different places,” says Mickens. “It’s not surprising that he had an interest in and was proficient in many different areas.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened to UFOs?&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/whatever-happened-ufos&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, June 26, 1971&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since 1968 the number of UFO sightings has dropped off, along with public interest in them.… [The] scientific debunking of the UFO phenomena and the subsequent, though not necessarily connected, decline in sightings presents an interesting behavioral pattern…. UFO reports usually run in five-year cycles and 1972 should be the start of another cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Update&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reports of unidentified flying objects have had their ups and downs. In 2020, people in the United States made more than 7,200 reports of UFO sightings — about 1,000 more than in 2019 and nearly 4,000 more than in 2018, according to the National UFO Reporting Center in Davenport, Wash. A quarter of last year’s reports occurred in March and April, when much of the country was under lockdown due to the pandemic. Many of these UFOs turned out to be drones or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/starlink-spacex-satellites-amazon-oneweb-global-internet-astronomy&quot;&gt;satellites&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/28/20, p. 24&lt;/em&gt;). In late April, the Pentagon officially released naval footage of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2165713/statement-by-the-department-of-defense-on-the-release-of-historical-navy-videos/&quot;&gt;unidentified aerial phenomena&lt;/a&gt;” that had been shared online, which may have primed some people to seek UFOs in their own backyards.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this 1930 painting, “Rhythm, Joy of Life”, by French artist Robert Delaunay. Do you find it colourful? And do you like it?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-42628&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;42628&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;0&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;1024px-Robert_Delaunay_-_Rythme_Joie_de_vivre-1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1024px-Robert_Delaunay_-_Rythme_Joie_de_vivre-1.jpg?fit=845%2C737&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1024px-Robert_Delaunay_-_Rythme_Joie_de_vivre-1.jpg?fit=300%2C262&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1024px-Robert_Delaunay_-_Rythme_Joie_de_vivre-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C893&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1024,893&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/21/we-like-the-original-versions-of-abstract-artworks-more-than-colour-shifted-ones/1024px-robert_delaunay_-_rythme_joie_de_vivre-1/&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;371&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1024px-Robert_Delaunay_-_Rythme_Joie_de_vivre-1.jpg?resize=426%2C371&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; width=&quot;426&quot; /&gt;Robert Delaunay – Rhythm, Joy of Life (1930)&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now what if every pixel in a digital version was rotated an equal distance on a “colour wheel” that represents every colour that people can see? Technically, the number of different colours in the image would be the same — but you’d probably perceive it to be &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; colourful. And, even if you’d never seen the original before, you’d probably like it less.  That, at least, is the conclusion of a fascinating &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2021-45647-001.pdf&quot;&gt;new paper &lt;/a&gt;in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance&lt;/em&gt;. The work contributes to our understanding not only of why certain colours are more common in art, but also of how we perceive colour.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42625&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carolin S. Altmann and colleagues at the Experimental Aesthetics Group at Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Germany, first identified 100 colourful abstract artworks by well-known artists. They then rotated each through a 360-degree wheel of perceivable colours, in steps of 60 degrees at a time. This gave them six differently coloured digital versions of each artwork, so 600 images in total. Twenty young participants with normal vision used six-point scales to rate each version of every artwork for “colourfulness” and, separately (on another day), for how much they liked them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-42631&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;42631&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;0&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;rotations&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rotations.png?fit=513%2C682&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rotations.png?fit=226%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rotations.png?fit=513%2C682&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;513,682&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/21/we-like-the-original-versions-of-abstract-artworks-more-than-colour-shifted-ones/rotations/&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rotations.png?resize=381%2C506&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; width=&quot;381&quot; /&gt;Rotated versions of “Rhythm, Joy of Life” used in the study. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2021-45647-001.pdf&quot;&gt;Altman &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; (2021)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that all but one of the participants felt the originals to be more colourful than the other versions. Also, about three quarters of the participants preferred the originals over the colour-shifted versions. “This effect is not only surprisingly consistent across participants, but also across images, and even survived rigorous statistical control of potentially confounding factors,” the team reports. In fact, 81% of the original images were both more liked and judged to be more colourful. The team’s analysis also revealed that the participants didn’t simply like very colourful images per se — rather, “they prefer versions of artworks that they perceive as more colourful”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each rotation included the same number of perceivable colours. So — assuming that the participants were unfamiliar with the artworks (and this isn’t reported on in the paper) — there must be something special about the colour palettes chosen by the artists, the team reasoned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their analysis revealed that three quarters of the artworks featured more yellow and orange than other hues. (This was also the case for another 113 artworks that the team had originally identified for possible inclusion in the study). Other research has also found find a bias among artists towards the yellow/orange range. So why might this be?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More yellow in a picture might make it seem closer to a scene lit by natural daylight (even if it’s an abstract image), and so preferred, the researchers suggest. But also, the human visual system is less sensitive to blueish-yellowish input than to red, say. (It’s been suggested that this made it easier for our ancestors to quickly spot reddish ripe fruit under changing light levels, from dawn to dusk.) “Potentially, artists thus have to overrepresent yellow colours in their palette to make them just as noticeable to the human observer as other colour hues with higher perceptual sensitivity,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Yellow” is also a narrow “colour category”. That is, the number of different hues that we perceive to be examples of yellow is pretty narrow; it’s much larger for red, say. So while a rotation may easily have changed a yellow pixel to one in another colour category, a red pixel may still be a type of “red” — which could make the artwork &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; to be less colourful and also less complex. Other studies have found that more complex artworks tend to get higher aesthetic ratings, so more apparently complex versions of the same painting might be preferred.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all languages use the same colour categories, however. For example, “light blue” and “dark blue” are fundamentally different categories in Russian and Greek — in which a colour cannot simply be called “blue”. It has been suggested that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/02/your-native-language-affects-what-you-can-and-cant-see/&quot;&gt;the colour categories that a person is familiar with affects their colour perception&lt;/a&gt;. It would be interesting, then, to see if a study using participants who use different colour categories would give different results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that the majority of participants in this study were women, and other work has found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/men-and-women-see-things-differently-literally-180954815/&quot;&gt;men and women don’t perceive colours in quite the same way&lt;/a&gt;. There are, then, still a lot of questions in relation to this work — but it’ll be really interesting to see what the answers turn out to be. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-45647-001&quot;&gt;Liking of Art and the Perception of Color&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Most butterflies sport colorful, eye-catching patterns on their wings. But some species, like the glasswing butterfly, use mostly transparent wings to hide in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To figure out &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/224/10/jeb237917/268372/Developmental-cellular-and-biochemical-basis-of&quot;&gt;how these Central American butterflies go incognito&lt;/a&gt;, researchers put the wings of glasswing butterflies (&lt;em&gt;Greta oto&lt;/em&gt;) under the microscope. Sparse, spindly scales overlaying a see-through wing membrane with antireflective properties help make these insects so stealthy, researchers report in the May issue of the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Biology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Transparency is the ultimate form of camouflage, says James Barnett, a behavioral ecologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, who wasn’t involved in the work. Transparent animals &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dragonfish-teeth-transparent-prey&quot;&gt;can instantly blend&lt;/a&gt; into any background (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/5/19&lt;/em&gt;). “It’s really hard to do,” Barnett says. “You have to modify your entire body to minimize any scattering or reflection of light.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aaron Pomerantz, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, became fascinated by butterflies with transparent wings while doing research in Peru. “They were really interesting and mysterious,” he recalls, “like these little, invisible jets that glide around in the rainforest.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using confocal and electron microscopes, Pomerantz and colleagues found that the black rims of &lt;em&gt;G. oto&lt;/em&gt;’s wings were densely packed with flat, leaflike scales. But the transparent areas sported narrow, bristle-like scales spaced farther apart. As a result, only about 2 percent of the underlying clear wing membrane was visible in black regions, but about 80 percent of the membrane was exposed in transparent areas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image alignwide size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;microscope images of a glasswing butterfly's wing&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100637&quot; height=&quot;284&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061621_MT_glasswing_inline-1_1030.png&quot; width=&quot;1030&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100637&quot;&gt;The boundary between clear and opaque regions of a glasswing butterfly wing (magnified image at left) reveals two types of scales. The transparent region contains sparse, thin scales that have either single or forked bristles (shown in false color at center). The black region contains overlapping, leaflike scales (shown in false color at right).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100637&quot;&gt;A. Pomerantz &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;JEB&lt;/em&gt; 2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You’d think the simplest solution would be to just not have any scales,” says coauthor Nipam Patel, a biologist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass. But butterflies need at least some scales in the transparent parts of their wings: The water-repellant scales help prevent the wings from sticking together when it rains, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The texture of &lt;em&gt;G. oto&lt;/em&gt;’s wing membrane also helps reduce the glare coming off transparent regions of the wing. If the membrane surface were flat, the abrupt change in optical properties between the air and wing would cause light traveling through the air to bounce off the wing’s surface and reduce transparency, Patel explains. But an array of tiny wax bumps coats the surface of the membrane, creating a more gradual shift between the optical qualities of the air and wing. That allows more light traveling through the air to pass through the wing rather than reflect off of it, softening the glare.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the transparent regions of glasswing butterfly wings naturally reflect only about 2 percent of light. Stripping off the waxy layer caused the wings to reflect about 2.5 times as much light as they normally do.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results may not only help biologists better understand how these butterflies hide from predators, but also inspire new antireflective coatings for camera lenses, solar panels and other devices, Pomerantz says.&lt;/p&gt;

When researchers stripped off the waxy layer, the smoothed wing (bottom right) reflected 2.5 times as much light (bottom left).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100635&quot;&gt;A.

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-deadly-2019-eruption-new-zealand-satellite-data-monitoring"/>

		<updated>2021-06-18T18:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;On December 9, 2019, a cloud of steam and volcanic gases blasted out of New Zealand’s Whakaari, or White Island, volcano. Relative to eruptions at other volcanoes, the explosion was small. But it claimed the lives of 22 people and injured another 25, many of whom suffered severe burns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, using high-resolution satellite data and computer algorithms, scientists have revealed &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abg1218&quot;&gt;how gases released by the volcano subtly changed&lt;/a&gt; before, during and after the 2019 eruption. Observing such small changes using satellites could greatly improve volcano monitoring and help spot early warnings of eruptions, the researchers report June 18 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Volcanologists typically use instruments on the ground to help warn of eruptions, monitoring changes in gases, such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, that quietly seep from volcanoes between blasts. But only around 50 of the world’s volcanoes are monitored in this way. Satellites have been used to study the plumes of large volcanoes, but the orbiting crafts haven’t been used to detect gases emitted by small eruptions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compared with large eruptions, like the blast that decapitated Washington’s Mount St. Helens in 1980, small-scale eruptions occur more often. So they pose a greater threat to people, says volcanologist Mike Burton of the University of Manchester in England.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image of Whakaari crater&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100659&quot; height=&quot;452&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061721_no_volcano_inline_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100659&quot;&gt;This bird’s-eye view provides a peek into the crater of Whakaari, or White Island, an active volcano that sits nearly 50 kilometers northeast of New Zealand’s North Island, in the Bay of Plenty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100659&quot;&gt;Krzysztof Belczyński/Flickr (&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/&quot;&gt;CC BY-SA 2.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By chance, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-5p&quot;&gt;Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite&lt;/a&gt; flew over Whakaari about an hour after the 2019 eruption and collected data on light reflected from the volcano’s plume of ejected gases with its Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument, or TROPOMI. “What we realized was that we could use [satellites] to actually look at unprecedentedly small explosions,” Burton says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From its seat in the sky, TROPOMI was better suited than ground instruments to gather information about the high-rising plume. And by the time TROPOMI passed overhead, much of the ash and other airborne particles that can blur ground observations of erupted gases had fallen out or evaporated from the plume.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Burton and his colleagues applied a computer algorithm to the TROPOMI data to calculate the backward trajectory of gases in the plume — essentially rewinding the volcanic eruption. This approach allowed the researchers to estimate how much sulfur dioxide that the volcano belched before, during and after the eruption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Roughly 40 minutes before Whakaari erupted, the volcano’s sulfur dioxide emissions increased from 10 kilograms per second to 45 kilograms per second — signaling a potential eruption — and the plume of sulfur dioxide and other gases began to rise, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GeoNet, a New Zealand geological hazard monitoring service, had raised an alert several weeks before the eruption, after detecting an uptick of ground tremor, geysers bubbling up in the volcano’s crater lake and sulfur dioxide emissions using ground instruments, though tour companies continued to visit the island. But the new study is the first time that scientists have used a satellite to detect precursory changes in sulfur dioxide emissions before a small eruption.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It was surprising that so much information about this small eruption could be gleaned using satellites, Burton says. “That’s a really exciting prospect because we can now expect to [measure] many more [eruptions] from space”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Changes in tremors caused by the eruption were recorded by a seismic station on the island and paralleled the researchers’ results. As sulfur dioxide emissions and plume height began to grow in the minutes before the blast, tremors increased, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This work shows that it’s now possible to measure gas emissions preceding small eruptions using satellites, which will complement ground-based systems and help provide warnings before eruptions, says, Jorge Andres Diaz a volcanologist at the University of Costa Rica in San Pedro, who was not involved in the study. “It [could] be your first line of monitoring, especially in places that are very remote.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But predicting eruptions involves looking at multiple factors together, including those that TROPOMI can’t detect, he says. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dormant-russia-volcano-bolshaya-udina-waking-complicated&quot;&gt;Tremors&lt;/a&gt; are one example (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/17/19&lt;/em&gt;). It’s also useful to monitor other emitted gases like carbon dioxide that, in conjunction with sulfur dioxide measurements, can reveal when new magma flushes into a volcano’s magma chamber, which can lead to an eruption. While TROPOMI can’t detect carbon dioxide, some other satellites can.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want to say we can forecast explosions perfectly; we can’t do that,” Burton says. “But this is a key step. It opens up a whole new frontier.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Some big scientific discoveries aren’t actually discovered. They are borrowed. That’s what happened when scientists enlisted proteins from an unlikely lender: green algae.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cells of the algal species &lt;em&gt;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&lt;/em&gt; are decorated with proteins that can sense light. That ability, first noticed in 2002, quickly caught the attention of brain scientists. A light-sensing protein promised the power to control neurons — the brain’s nerve cells — by providing a way to turn them on and off, in exactly the right place and time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nerve cells genetically engineered to produce the algal proteins become light-controlled puppets. A flash of light could induce a quiet neuron to fire off signals or force an active neuron to fall silent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This molecule is the light sensor that we needed,” says vision neuroscientist Zhuo-Hua Pan, who had been searching for a way to control vision cells in mice’s retinas.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The method enabled by these loaner proteins &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/let-there-be-light-1&quot;&gt;is now called optogenetics&lt;/a&gt;, for its combination of light (opto) and genes. In less than two decades, optogenetics has led to big insights into how memories are stored, what creates perceptions and what goes wrong in the brain during depression and addiction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Science News 100&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3095150&quot; height=&quot;84&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/centennial-logo-800x84.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To celebrate our upcoming 100th anniversary, we’re launching a series that highlights some of the biggest advances in science over the last century. For more on the past, present and future of neuroscience, visit Century of Science: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/century/brains-future-neuroscience-memory-mind-network&quot;&gt;Our brains, our futures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Using light to drive the activity of certain nerve cells, scientists have toyed with mouse hallucinations: Mice have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/manipulating-nerve-cells-makes-mice-see-something-not-there&quot;&gt;seen lines that aren’t there&lt;/a&gt; and have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/making-mouse-memories&quot;&gt;remembered a room they had never been inside&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists have used optogenetics to make mice &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mapping-aggression-circuits-brain&quot;&gt;fight, mate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/switch-eating&quot;&gt;eat&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/let-there-be-light-0&quot;&gt;given blind mice sight&lt;/a&gt;. In a big first, optogenetics recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/blindness-retinitis-pigmentosa-gene-therapy-vision-optogenetics&quot;&gt;restored aspects of a blind man’s vision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An early clue to the potential of optogenetics came around 1 a.m. on August 4, 2004. Neuroscientist Ed Boyden was in a lab at Stanford, checking on a dish of neurons that possessed a gene for one of the algal light sensors, called channelrhodopsin-2. Boyden was going to flash blue light on the cells and see if they fired signals. To his amazement, the very first cell he checked responded to the light with a burst of action, Boyden wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3155186/&quot;&gt;2011 account&lt;/a&gt;. The possibilities raised by that little spark of activity, described in a 2005 technical report by Boyden, Karl Deisseroth of Stanford University and colleagues, quickly became realities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Pan’s lab, light-responsive proteins restored vision in mice with damaged retinas, a finding that has now led to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-rewire-eye&quot;&gt;clinical trial in people&lt;/a&gt;. Optogenetics’ promise wasn’t a given in those early days, as scientists were first learning how to use these proteins in neurons. “At that time, no one anticipated that this optogenetic work would have such a huge impact,” Pan says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since those early discoveries, the algae’s light sensors have been adopted for use in numerous brain research arenas. Neuroscientist Talia Lerner of Northwestern University in Chicago, for example, uses optogenetics to study connections between cells in the mouse brain. The method allows her to tease apart the relationships between cells that produce and respond to dopamine, a chemical messenger involved in movement and reward. Those cellular links, illuminated by optogenetics, might help reveal details about motivation and learning. “My research really wouldn’t be possible in its current form without optogenetics,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics is also indispensable for Jeanne Paz of the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco. She and her colleagues have been hunting for the cells that can stop seizures from spreading across the brain. By giving her a way to control distinct groups of neurons, optogenetics is crucial to her search. “We really could not ask these questions with any other tool,” Paz says.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Her optogenetics-aided search led Paz to a brain structure called the thalamus, a way station for many neural networks in the brain. “I remember the goose bumps I experienced the first time I shined the light into the thalamus and it stopped the seizure,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, optogenetics research has taken place mostly in mice. But insights into more complex brains, including those of primates, may soon be found, says Yasmine El-Shamayleh of Columbia University. In 2009, Boyden and colleagues described optogenetics in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19409264/&quot;&gt;macaque&lt;/a&gt;. El-Shamayleh and others are pushing this line of research, hard. “We are definitely on the cusp” of revealing some fascinating principles of the primate brain, such as how the brain transforms signals from the eyes into perceptions, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics has evolved quickly. Scientists have engineered and optimized new light sensors and new ways of combining them with other techniques. An important reason for today’s widespread innovation, says Lerner, was the early spirit of sharing by optogenetics pioneers. At Stanford, Deisseroth would regularly run workshops to train other scientists on the technique. “In some ways, that’s as important as inventing it,” Lerner says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it’s worth taking a minute to appreciate the original sharers. No matter what happens next in this swiftly moving field, one thing is certain: Brain scientists will be forever in the algae’s debt.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02402-1&quot;&gt;Ali &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; set out to validate the KFRE in advanced CKD taking into account their cause of CKD (diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and other causes.  The KFRE performed well across all diseases and was found to have adequate discrimination and calibration.  What I found to be very interesting was that the KFRE provided better clinical utility for decision-making like pre-ESKD planning than basing it on GFR cutoffs alone.  Typically, we start planning for transplant evaluations, dialysis education, dialysis access placement, etc when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ajkd.org/article/S0272-6386(15)01019-7/pdf&quot;&gt;eGFR is &amp;lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2&lt;/a&gt; (in this study they used &amp;lt; 20 and &amp;lt; 15 mL/min/1.73m2).  with using the KFRE in Ali &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, they identified more patients who were likely to progress to ESKD and delay in others by using KFRE thresholds of &amp;gt; 40% for 2-year risk and &amp;gt; 50% for 5-year risk of ESKD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying patients who are progressing to ESKD is kept in planning for dialysis modality, access placement, and transplant referral.  If we can catch individuals early and start the process then there are fewer hospitalizations and poor outcomes.  Other studies have addressed using the KFRE in the necessity of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28835850/&quot;&gt;nephrology referrals&lt;/a&gt; and using it as a risk-based approach to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29375884&quot;&gt;guide CKD care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my review of the literature and Ali &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;.’s article, I definitely will start using the KFRE in my clinical assessment and planning for patients with advanced CKD.  Maybe it will help identify those patients who will benefit from early referral to transplant and access placement or at the least early education endeavors for those patients.  I can only see positives from using the KFRE as another clinical tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are other additional uses of the KFRE in your practice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you noticed an increase in scam texts recently?&lt;/strong&gt; I certainly have — and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210611-how-fraudsters-exploited-our-fears-during-the-pandemic&quot;&gt;so has David Robson&lt;/a&gt;, writing at &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;.  These scammers often make it seem like we are facing some immediate threat like legal trouble or loss of money, capitalising on the fact that in this kind of situation we are less likely to think and act rationally. And the pandemic has provided just the right conditions for these scams to flourish, Robson writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42600&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As we mentioned &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/04/magic-tricks-and-media-literacy-the-weeks-best-psychology-links/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a couple of weeks ago&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, the idea that groups succumb to “groupthink” is hotly contested.&lt;/strong&gt; This week at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/how-humans-think-when-they-think-group/&quot;&gt;Annie Murphy Paul takes a look at the more positive side of group cognition&lt;/a&gt;, drawing on a fascinating case study in which sailors on board an out-of-control aircraft carrier worked together to narrowly avert disaster. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Australian study has found that primary-aged kids perform better when their schools are surrounded by more green spaces. &lt;/strong&gt;It’s not simply the case that these schools are attended by children from wealthier families, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/green-space-around-primary-schools-may-improve-students-academic-performance-161673&quot;&gt;write the researchers Alison Carver and Amanda J Wheeler&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, because the research compared schools with similar socioeconomic backgrounds. Instead, the pair suggests that the effect could be related to reduced pollution near schools with more greenery, or de-stressing effects of the green spaces themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paying too much attention to something can distort our perceptions of the world,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyche.co/ideas/sometimes-paying-attention-means-we-see-the-world-less-clearly&quot;&gt;argues Henry Taylor&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Psyche&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could brands one day insert advertisements into your dreams?&lt;/strong&gt; That’s the fear of a group of dream researchers, who have released an open letter calling for “dream manipulation” to be regulated, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/06/are-advertisers-coming-your-dreams&quot;&gt;reports Sofia Moutinho&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have found that when exposed to the common antidepressant citalopram, crayfish become bolder, emerging out of their shelters more readily to look for food. &lt;/strong&gt;The study was conducted in the lab, but used levels of antidepressants which have previously been found in streams, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/antidepressant-pollution-in-water-may-make-crayfish-bolder&quot;&gt;reports Douglas Main&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt;. This suggests that in the wild, antidepressant drugs which make their way into the environment via wastewater could affect the animals’ behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-outreach-hispanic-communities-philadelphia"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3100619</id>
		<updated>2021-06-18T10:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHILADELPHIA&lt;/strong&gt; — In a makeshift tent behind a soccer goal and close enough to a taco stand that the smell of grilling barbacoa and carnitas drifts over, Melissa Pluguez cheerfully asks a man, in Spanish, if he’s right- or left-handed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The man, wearing jeans and a red T-shirt with white letters that spell Abercrombie, answers right, and confesses he’s a bit afraid of needles. Even so, he’s been eager to get a COVID-19 vaccine, Pluguez translates, but hasn’t felt comfortable going to vaccination sites around Philadelphia. But when he heard about this vaccination event — staffed by local, Spanish-speaking medical professionals and held at his church congregation’s regular Sunday gathering — he felt ready.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pluguez is a nurse practitioner for critical care at Cooper University Health Care in Camden, N.J., and co-medical director of Unidos Contra COVID, the small group that organized this vaccine outreach event. She tells the man that the fear is worse than the needle, and he nods and looks away as she injects the Pfizer vaccine into his left arm. Afterward, he smiles, and the two bump elbows before the man leaves to pick up his vaccination card. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s no free beer in sight, nor is anyone getting complimentary tickets to Phillies baseball games. Instead, roughly 300 people are clustered around soccer fields that border the church parking lot. The main event is a tournament, where professional-looking players in uniform square off as spectators cheer. On adjacent fields, children kick balls around or chase each other through the lines of people waiting to buy tacos or mango slices stuffed into plastic cups. Couples dance to upbeat music emanating from loudspeakers set up near Unidos Contra COVID’s tent. Inside, behind dark mesh netting partitions set up for privacy amid all that action, vaccines are being delivered into arm after arm.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the end, this sort of targeted approach may be a more impactful way than the flashier, broader efforts, like beer giveaways and large cash prizes, to reach the roughly &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home&quot;&gt;35 percent of adults&lt;/a&gt; in the United States who haven’t yet gotten at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. Such a hyperlocal focus, experts say, can address the idiosyncratic and complex array of reasons that people aren’t getting vaccinated, especially in often overlooked and underserved communities that have experienced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-surge-4th-wave-us-young-cases-vaccination&quot;&gt;higher rates of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; and relatively low numbers of vaccinations (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/3/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like in other parts of the country, Hispanic communities in Philadelphia have been especially impacted by COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phila.gov/programs/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/data/testing/#/&quot;&gt;hospitalization rates&lt;/a&gt; for Hispanic people in the city who are 35 and older have been higher than for any other group, as have death rates for those 75 and older. And vaccinations have lagged; only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phila.gov/programs/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/data/vaccine/&quot;&gt;37 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the Hispanic population has received one dose, compared with 51 percent of white residents as of June 14.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A group of local doctors and nursed formed Unidos Contra COVID, which means United Against COVID, earlier this year to address these disparities. The Hispanic population in Philadelphia is diverse, and “our experiences and makeup is hardly monolithic,” says José Torradas, an emergency room physician and co-medical director of Unidos Contra COVID, who left his job earlier this year to focus on outreach full-time. People in this community aren’t getting the vaccine “for different reasons in different groups.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Figuring out those reasons has become crucial to Unidos Contra COVID’s mission. The group has found that for Central American and Mexican communities in parts of Philadelphia, access has been the biggest problem. Meanwhile, in the predominantly Puerto Rican and Dominican communities of northern Philadelphia, Torradas says, vaccine skepticism stems from misinformation and a general distrust of the government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;José Torradas rubs alcohol on a masked woman's arm&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100621&quot; height=&quot;544&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061721_jl_vaccineoutreach_inline1_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100621&quot;&gt;José Torradas, a physician and co-medical director of Unidos Contra COVID, rubs alcohol on a woman’s arm before giving her a COVID-19 vaccine shot at a local community gathering on June 13 in the Philadelphia area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100621&quot;&gt;Paula Lopez&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Barriers to access&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the church event, Unidos Contra COVID came to bring vaccines to people who won’t travel to unfamiliar places to get them, because of language barriers or for fear of deportation. Many of the people gathered around the soccer fields are undocumented, Torradas says, though his group never asks about immigration status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These Sunday gatherings represent the few hours each week that these communities come together, he says, often after church. “It’s a sanctuary, a place they feel safe.” For that reason, organizers asked that the church not be named.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rest of the week, it’s either work or home for many undocumented people. “Anything outside of that routine represents a risk,” Torradas says. Even though local pharmacies may be close, or federal distribution sites accessible by bus, fears of interacting with government services or law enforcement keep many from getting vaccinated, he says. By law, undocumented immigrants are eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s lots of desire [here] for the vaccine,” Torradas says. “They just don’t want to get deported.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Kaiser Family Foundation poll in May found that Hispanics who have yet to receive a COVID-19 vaccine are about twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites or Blacks to say &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-access-information-experiences-hispanic-adults/&quot;&gt;they’d like to get vaccinated as soon as possible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shot status&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hispanic adults expressed a desire to get the COVID-19 vaccine “as soon as possible” at much higher rates than Black or white adults, according to a telephone survey of 2,097 adults conducted April 15 to April 29 by the Kaiser Family Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To best serve these communities, Unidos Contra COVID teams up with trusted figures in the area, like José Hernández. He’s a church leader who can identify times and places where the group could have the most impact, and who can spread the word among the community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking loudly to be heard over the music, Hernández says that he had been trying to connect members of the congregation with vaccines since they first became available. But most people weren’t willing to travel far to get the shots, even though they are free. And simply going to their doctor often isn’t an option, since Hispanic Americans also have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-271.pdf&quot;&gt;highest rates of uninsurance&lt;/a&gt; of any racial or ethnic group according to the U.S. Census Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Being able to get the vaccines at a regular community event, and from people who speak Spanish, “has just been incredible,” Hernández says. Besides two large events that Unidos Contra COVID has held at his church, Torradas and Pluguez have both come out to give shots to smaller groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve never had an experience like this … where doctors come to us,” Hernández says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fear of deportation and language issues aren’t the only barriers to vaccination in some of these communities. There’s also gun violence to worry about. In 2020, there were over &lt;a href=&quot;https://controller.phila.gov/philadelphia-audits/mapping-gun-violence/#/2020&quot;&gt;2,200 shootings in Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, among the highest number for any U.S. city. Walking or taking the bus even just a kilometer or two to a vaccine distribution site in some neighborhoods “might mean crossing two or three gang turfs,” Torradas says. Some people have told him they don’t feel comfortable leaving their own block.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To reach such communities, Torradas and his colleagues have set up shop in places like schools and shopping malls, operating on weekends and evenings, in addition to church events. Many of the people who come “are day laborers who leave [home] at 5 a.m. and don’t get back till late,” Pluguez says. And many “are not hesitant. They are just not able to access the resources.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Addressing vaccine hesitancy&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, there are people in these communities who are skeptical of vaccines, Pluguez says. Reasons range from general distrust of government, to fears that stem from misinformation, such as that the vaccine causes sterility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the concern “is truly borne of crimes that have been committed [against] both Black and Hispanic communities,” Pluguez says, citing official programs that resulted in up to a third of &lt;a href=&quot;https://nwhn.org/sterilization-abuse-the-policies-behind-the-practice/&quot;&gt;Puerto Rican women being sterilized&lt;/a&gt; from the 1930s to 1970s, often without informed consent. “So hearing now that this vaccine might make them sterile? That runs deep, it runs very deep.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another common, false rumor is that the vaccines contain microchips with location trackers. Such rumors, which spread quickly on social media, can easily take hold in communities with undocumented immigrants. “They don’t want to have to fear every day that something they just put in their bodies is going to make them prone to being deported,” Pluguez says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address that mistrust, Unidos Contra COVID tries to identify trusted members of the community who could act as effective messengers. People are more likely to listen “to a face they recognize, who has been around longer than the vaccine,” Torradas says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Individuals personally impacted by COVID, especially younger people, are especially effective. “Bring me the most fit person in this congregation who almost died of COVID and have him and the medical professionals stand in front of everybody, tell their story and answer their questions. That’s the formula for hyperlocal buy in,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unidos Contra COVID also canvasses nearby streets during their vaccination events, trying to meet people where they are. “The moment I start speaking Spanish, you can absolutely see their eyes light up, and they start engaging in a way that’s very different,” Pluguez says. From that kernel of trust, she listens to people’s concerns about vaccination “without putting blame on them,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When misinformation comes up, she addresses it practically. “[If people ask] ‘What if there’s a microchip?’ I say, ‘Come look at the vaccine for yourself. Look at the needle. Look at the vial. You can see that there is nothing in it,’” Pluguez says. Often she talks about her experience as an emergency room nurse during the worst of the pandemic. “I share with them how many hands I’ve held of the sick and dying, alone,” she says, and how the vaccine can prevent that from happening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a previous vaccine outreach event in south Philadelphia, Pluguez once spent 45 minutes talking with one man she encountered walking down the street with his pregnant wife and three young boys. “He’d heard a lot of the rumors,” she says, about microchips and sterility. Pluguez addressed those concerns in Spanish, while playing with his kids to keep them entertained so she and the man could talk more. Twice during their conversation, the man left, saying he’d think more about it. “He made it a block before coming back with more questions,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pluguez pulled up a chair for him, and they continued talking. As the conversation went on, she noticed a shift in his demeanor. “He started looking directly at me and making jokes,” she says. “That’s when I got the feeling that he finally trusts me.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the man expressed worry about missing work if he got sick from the vaccine, Pluguez remembers. So she asked him, “What if you get sick with COVID? What is your wife going to do if you’re laid up in the hospital? Who is going to pay the bills?” Ultimately, that message got through. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Then he said, ‘As long as you stand by my side, I’ll do it.’ And I said, ‘I’ll be here with you every step of the way,’” she says. Pluguez stayed with him through vaccine registration, the shot and the 15-minute waiting period afterward. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was really proud of him … I had such joy in my heart,” Pluguez says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re no longer looking at the people who were desperate to get vaccinated,” she says. “Now every single person who shows up is a victory, is one step further into making COVID an issue of the past.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Amid the food, music and soccer at that Sunday vaccination event, 151 people got their first or second vaccine dose. Since Unidos Contra COVID began their events in early May, the group has vaccinated about 850 people, and hopes to scale up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the afternoon event, Pluguez pulled out thick UPS package. “Our official 501(c)(3) documents,” she says. “I promised José I wouldn’t open them until we could do it together.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They expect to get approval from the Internal Revenue Service in a few weeks. Becoming an official nonprofit will help the group more easily apply directly for grant money, allowing it to purchase more freezers for vaccine storage and hire more full-time staff. Currently, about 50 people contribute to the effort as volunteers, with Pluguez and Torradas devoting the most time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two pose for a picture with the documents, celebrating the milestone. “I may shed a tear, I’m so excited,” she says. Then, Pluguez gathers her things to leave for the hospital. Before she goes, someone from the taco stand brings her a Styrofoam box filled with dinner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve worked the past six nights; tonight is my last shift,” she says. “I get off at 7 a.m., then I can sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We’re pleased to announce a new arXivLabs collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.litmaps.co/&quot;&gt;Litmaps&lt;/a&gt;. The new &lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXivLabs&lt;/a&gt; feature allows arXiv users to quickly generate a citation map of the top connected articles, and then explore the citation network using the Litmaps research platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A citation network is a visualization of the literature cited by a research paper. The network shows how papers are related to each other in terms of concepts, subject areas, and history — and they’re valuable for &lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hgKElc&quot;&gt;analyzing the development of research areas, making decisions on research directions, and assessing the impacts of research, researchers, institutes, countries, and individual papers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers can now view a Litmap citation network for a specific paper, directly from the arXiv abstract page by clicking on the “Bibliographic Tools” tab at the bottom of an abstract page and activating “Litmaps.” Using this tool, arXiv readers can now easily jump from articles they are interested in and use Litmaps’ custom visualization and automated search tools to find other critical articles they may have missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_1038&quot; style=&quot;width: 466px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot of litmaps tool on arXiv abstract page&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-1038&quot; height=&quot;424&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/06/Litmaps-Screenshot.png&quot; width=&quot;466&quot; /&gt;From an arXiv abstract page, readers can activate the Litmaps tool to view citation networks&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An arXivLabs Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to be able to offer arXiv readers new visual ways to explore scientific literature. Litmaps will enrich the arXiv reading experience and help readers find what they need,” said Eleonora Presani, executive director of arXiv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tool supports arXiv’s mission to provide an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant, emerging science and establish their contribution to advancing research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are arXiv users ourselves at Litmaps, so it’s great to be able to collaborate and integrate with arXiv, which is a key resource for the research community,” said Axton Pitt, cofounder of Litmaps. The company aims to make the process of literature discovery easy and fun, and welcomes feedback via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LitmapsApp&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:team@litmaps.co&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this blog post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.litmaps.co/blog/posts/adding-interactive-citation-maps-to-arxiv&quot;&gt;appears here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Quantum mechanics usually applies to very small objects: atoms, electrons and the like. But physicists have now brought the equivalent of a 10-kilogram object to the edge of the quantum realm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists with the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, reduced vibrations in a combination of the facility’s mirrors to &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abh2634&quot;&gt;nearly the lowest level allowed&lt;/a&gt; by quantum mechanics, they report in the June 18 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers quelled differences between the jiggling of LIGO’s four 40-kilogram mirrors, putting them in near-perfect sync. When the mirrors are combined in this way, they behave effectively like a single, 10-kilogram object.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LIGO is designed to measure gravitational waves, using laser light that bounces between sets of mirrors &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-explained&quot;&gt;in the detector’s two long arms&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/11/16&lt;/em&gt;). But physicist Vivishek Sudhir of MIT and colleagues instead used the laser light to monitor the mirrors’ movements to extreme precision and apply electric fields to resist the motion. “It’s almost like a noise-canceling headphone,” says Sudhir. But instead of measuring nearby sounds and canceling out that noise, the technique cancels out motion.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The researchers reduced the mirrors’ relative motions to about 10.8 phonons, or quantum units of vibration, close to the zero-phonon quantum limit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s purpose is not to better understand gravitational waves, but to get closer to revealing secrets of quantum mechanics. Scientists are still trying to understand why large objects don’t typically follow the laws of quantum mechanics. Such objects lose their quantum properties, or decohere. Studying quantum states of more massive objects could help scientists pin down how decoherence happens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have observed much smaller objects in quantum states. In 2020, physicist Markus Aspelmeyer of the University of Vienna and colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-cooled-nanoparticle-quantum-limit-ground-state&quot;&gt;brought vibrations of a nanoparticle to the quantum limit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/30/20&lt;/em&gt;). LIGO’s mirrors are “a fantastic system to study decoherence effects on super-massive objects in the quantum regime,” says Aspelmeyer.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-marine-ice-cliffs-sheets-collapse-not-inevitable-sea-level"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3100606</id>
		<updated>2021-06-17T18:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;When it comes to global warming and sea level rise, scientists have made some dire predictions. One of the most calamitous involves the widespread collapse of ice cliffs along the edges of Greenland and Antarctica, which could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-sheets-collapse-sea-level-rise-climate-change&quot;&gt;raise sea level as much as 4 meters by 2200&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/6/19&lt;/em&gt;). Now, new simulations suggest that massive glaciers flowing into the sea &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abf6271&quot;&gt;may not be as vulnerable&lt;/a&gt; to such collapses as once believed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One hypothesis that projected calamitous sea level rise is called the marine ice cliff instability. It suggests that sea-facing bluffs of ice more than 100 meters tall will fail and then slough off to expose fresh ice. Those new cliffs will in turn disintegrate, fall into the sea and float away, setting off a relatively rapid retreat of the glacier that boosts sea level rise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although discussed for years, the phenomenon hasn’t yet been seen in today’s glaciers, says Jeremy Bassis, a glaciologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “But that may not be surprising, due to the relatively short record of observations in the field and by satellites,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of the dearth of field data, Bassis and colleagues decided to use computer simulations to explore ice-cliff behavior. Unlike previous models, the researchers’ simulations considered how ice flows under pressure as well as how it fractures when highly stressed. This blended model is “a pioneering composite,” says Nicholas Golledge, a glaciologist at the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, who wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;First, the researchers simulated the collapse of a 135-meter-tall ice cliff on dry land. Over a virtual period of weeks, the face of the cliff shattered and then slumped down to the base, where the icy rubble helped buttress the cliff against further collapse. Researchers have often seen this result in the field, Bassis says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, the team simulated a 400-meter-tall glacier flowing into water that was 290 meters deep. These dimensions are typical of some of the massive glaciers in Greenland flowing into deep fjords, Bassis says. When the cybercliff collapsed, ice that fell into the water at the cliff’s base floated away, leading to repeated failures and rapid, runaway collapse of the glacier. But adding even a small amount of back pressure at the base of the cliff — as would happen if icebergs got stuck and couldn’t waft away, or if they froze in place — prevented a runaway collapse, Bassis and his team reports in the June 18 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. “We didn’t expect this to be the case,” Bassis says. “But if small bergs got stuck in the shallows ahead of the ice cliff, it was enough to buttress the [cliff] face,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simulations of an 800-meter-tall glacier flowing into 690 meters of water, comparable to the dimensions of the Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers in Antarctica, yielded similar results. The researchers also found that in relatively warm ambient temperatures, ice flow upstream of the cliff thins the glacier and reduces the height of the cliff, thus reducing the likelihood of runaway collapses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team’s simulations “capture what I think of as realistic behavior,” says Golledge, who coauthored &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abj3266&quot;&gt;a commentary on the study&lt;/a&gt; in the same issue of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. Future fieldwork may help validate the group’s results. If the simulations hold, Golledge says, the less dire results may mean slower sea level rise in the short term than otherwise predicted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bassis and his colleagues’ analysis “is an important piece of work,” says Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved in the study. The results, he says, “provide a balance between the possibilities for extreme runaway collapse and some that are more realistic.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gambling is big business in the UK. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/health-survey-for-england/2018/health-survey-for-england-2018-supplementary-analysis-on-gambling&quot;&gt;NHS Digital&lt;/a&gt;, 57% of men and 54% of women reported gambling in 2018, while the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/about-us/statistics-and-research&quot;&gt;Gambling Commission&lt;/a&gt; suggests that online gambling grew by 8.1% from 2019 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, gambling changed quite significantly: while consumers could still buy scratchcards and lottery tickets in supermarkets and off licenses, betting shops were closed and sports matches cancelled, leading many activities to move entirely online. And according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-021-10029-y&quot;&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; from researchers at the University of Bristol, although the British public gambled less overall during lockdown, among regular gamblers, rates of &lt;em&gt;online&lt;/em&gt; gambling increased substantially. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42587&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data came from participants in a longitudinal study that has been taking place since the 1990s, who were sent extra questionnaires during the 2020 lockdown. Questions on gambling focused on activity in the previous month, with participants asked whether, and how often, they had engaged in the National Lottery, scratchcards, online gambling or betting, and other forms of gambling. The questionnaires also focused on participants’ mental health and financial security and employment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, gambling frequency reduced during lockdown — unsurprising, considering that many in-person opportunities to gamble were off-limits. This was true for both regular gamblers (those who gambled once a week or more before the pandemic) and occasional gamblers (who gambled less than weekly). However, the proportion of people taking part in online gambling activities like poker, bingo, and casino games increased sixfold among regular gamblers, and doubled among occasional gamblers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neither depression nor anxiety were linked with frequency of gambling. However, alcohol use was: people who drank heavily — more than six units more than once a week — were more likely to gamble weekly compared to not gambling at all. Finances were also relevant — people who were struggling financially even before COVID-19 hit were more likely to engage in any kind of gambling during lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not a huge surprise that online gambling increased during the pandemic: there were fewer opportunities for gambling outside of the home, and as a recreational activity, gambling may have relieved the boredom of lockdown. But the team worry that online gambling could represent a bigger threat than its offline counterpart to some groups, with young people in particular susceptible to being “sucked in” to addictive online gambling. The rise of eSports and the increasingly popular combination of gaming and gambling could be a particular issue here — overall, the Gambling Commission &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news-action-and-statistics/Statistics-and-research/Covid-19-research/Covid-19-updated-August-2020/Gambling-business-data-on-gambling-during-Covid-19-updated-August-2020.aspx&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; the biggest increase during lockdown was in bets on eSports. Increased levels of home working, too, could also lead more people, alone at home, to start gambling.                     &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The strong link between binge drinking and gambling was also of concern, lead author Alan Emond &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2021/may/online-gambling.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, as they are “both addictive behaviours which can have serious health and social consequences.” Many of those who reported gambling had also faced financial difficulties before COVID-19, another concerning finding of the study — gambling to get out of difficult financial situations could simply compound the issue, drawing people into even more debt. The team also suggests that the study may have underestimated the extent of gambling, as 70% of participants were women and men were more likely to be regular gamblers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all gambling behaviour will be problematic: many people happily buy the odd scratchcard or enter the Lottery every week without developing a serious problem. However, the links with both alcohol use and financial insecurity point to the darker side of gambling — and may suggest that digital interventions or restrictions on gambling sites could be needed to reach people who are struggling with gambling at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780197546123&quot;&gt;Tsunami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;James Goff and Walter Dudley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oxford Univ., $34.95&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On March 27, 1964, Ted Pederson was helping load oil onto a tanker in Seward, Alaska, when a magnitude 9.2 quake struck. Within seconds, the waterfront began sliding into the bay. As Pederson ran up the dock toward shore, a tsunami lifted the tanker and rafts of debris onto the dock, knocking him unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pederson survived, but more than 100 others in Alaska did not. His story is just one of more than 400 harrowing eyewitness accounts that bring such disasters to life in &lt;em&gt;Tsunami.&lt;/em&gt; Written by geologist James Goff and oceanographer Walter Dudley, the book also weaves in accounts from researchers examining the geologic record to shed light on prehistoric tsunamis.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Chapter by chapter, Goff and Dudley offer readers a primer on tsunamis: Most are caused by undersea earthquakes, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/killer-waves&quot;&gt;some are triggered by landslides&lt;/a&gt;, the sudden collapse of volcanic islands or meteorites hitting the ocean (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/6/04, p. 152&lt;/em&gt;). Readers may be surprised to learn that tsunamis need not occur on the coast: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tsunami-lake-tahoe&quot;&gt;Lake Tahoe&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/10/00, p. 378&lt;/em&gt;) and New Zealand’s Lake Tarawera are just two of many inland locales mentioned that have experienced freshwater tsunamis.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Copiously illustrated and peppered with maps, the book takes readers on a world-spanning tour of ancient and recent tsunamis, from a deep-ocean impact off the coast of South America about 2.5 million years ago to numerous tsunamis of the 21st century. The authors’ somber treatment of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tsunami-disaster-scientists-model-big-quake-and-its-consequences&quot;&gt;the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004&lt;/a&gt; stands out (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/8/05, p. 19&lt;/em&gt;). Triggered by a magnitude 9.1 earthquake, the megawave killed more than 130,000 people in Indonesia alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors — Goff is a professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney and Dudley is a researcher at the University of Hawaii at Hilo — help readers understand tsunamis’ power via descriptions of the damage they’ve wrought. For instance, the account of a huge wave in Alaska that scoured mature trees from steep slopes along fjords up to a height of 524 meters — about 100 meters taller than the Empire State Building — may leave readers stunned. But it’s the heart-thumping stories of survivors who ran to high ground, clambered up tall trees or clung to debris after washing out to sea that linger with the reader. They remind us of the human cost of living on the shore when great waves strike.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-dust-cold-spell-why-giant-star-dimmed"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3100584</id>
		<updated>2021-06-16T15:06:01+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Astronomers around the world were startled in late 2019 when Betelgeuse, one of the brightest stars in the sky, grew dark for several months. Rumors swirled that the star was about to go supernova. It didn’t. But debate over what &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; going on exploded. Now, newly released images taken before and during the “Great Dimming” suggest what happened: The star’s surface cooled and triggered a cloud of dust that temporarily blocked its light.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is the best interpretation we can get with the data that we have … without flying our spaceship to Betelgeuse and seeing what’s going on there,” says astrophysicist Emily Cannon of KU Leuven in Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cannon and colleagues used the SPHERE instrument on the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile to take snapshots of Betelgeuse for more than a year. Serendipitously, the team had captured an image of the star in January 2019, months before the dimming began, and could compare that image with others taken in December 2019 and January and March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03546-8&quot;&gt;dimming wasn’t spread uniformly&lt;/a&gt; across Betelgeuse’s surface, the team reports June 16 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. A dark splotch was concentrated over the star’s southern hemisphere. The researchers then ran computer simulations of the star, which included incorporating how dynamic gas bubbles constantly churn beneath its surface, to figure out the likeliest explanation for the way that the dimming played out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier observations of the star had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-star-dim-supernova-death-what-happened&quot;&gt;split astronomers into two camps&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/29/20&lt;/em&gt;). One group thought that a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-star-dust-supernova-explosion&quot;&gt;cloud of dust&lt;/a&gt; had blocked Betelgeuse’s light (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/12/20&lt;/em&gt;). Another thought that there wasn’t enough evidence of dust, and the dimming was due to temporary cooling at Betelgeuse’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image of the sky with the outline of the Orion constellation&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100586&quot; height=&quot;515&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061521_lg_betelgeuse_inline1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1030&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100586&quot;&gt;Betelgeuse, one of the brightest stars in the sky, marks the shoulder (circled in red) of the constellation Orion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100586&quot;&gt;Nick Risinger/skysurvey.org, ESO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Astrophysicist Miguel Montargès says that now that he’s seen his team’s data, he’s in both camps. “The most natural conclusion is that both events happened,” says Montargès, of the Paris Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team’s hypothesis is that in late 2019, a temporary cold patch formed in Betelgeuse’s southern hemisphere due to the normal churning of surface plasma, and that cooling caused the star’s light to dim. The cold patch then allowed gas that had been released from the star’s surface to cool enough to form dust particles, which further blocked the star’s light.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“You start getting a runaway effect,” which makes it easier for more dust to form, says astrophysicist Emily Levesque of the University of Washington in Seattle, who was not involved in the research but wrote a commentary in the same issue of &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. As the dust spread out, the starlight shone through again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some astronomers are still unconvinced that dust is part of the answer. The images plus simulations don’t prove dust was there, says astrophysicist Thavisha Dharmawardena of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. “This discussion will continue till we obtain direct evidence for dust,” says Dharmawardena, who has looked for — and failed to find — signs of dust during the Great Dimming.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Montargès thinks the dust was just hard to see using other techniques. “When people say they are not seeing new dust, I think they are wrong,” he says. “It’s that their data does not allow them to see it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both researchers agree that the Atacama Large Millimeter Array in Chile could break the stalemate. That telescope was out of commission last summer due to the COVID-19 pandemic, when its observations would have been most useful. More observations are scheduled for this summer, and if dust is still there, ALMA should see it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, “if we cannot identify it, it’s not because it’s not there,” Montargès says. “It’s because we are too late.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Betelgeuse observations may help astronomers recognize similar dimming events in other stars, Levesque says. Betelgeuse is Earth’s closest red supergiant star, a late phase of the stellar life cycle that comes before a supernova explosion. While dust does not predict an explosion, it can be part of how these stars lose mass before they die.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So when will Betelgeuse go out with a bang? “Not today,” Montargès says. “Every day, we are closer to the explosion, that’s for sure. I think it’s not tomorrow, or even in our lifetime, for Betelgeuse.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Bente Riegler will talk about a paper &quot;Toward a New Theory of Motor Synergies&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driven by recent empirical studies, we offer a new understanding of
the degrees of freedom problem, and propose a refined concept of
synergy as a neural organization that ensures a one-to-many mapping of
variables providing for both stability of important performance
variables and flexibility of motor patterns to deal with possible
perturbations and/or secondary tasks. Empirical evidence is reviewed,
including a discussion of the operationalization of
stability/flexibility through the method of the uncontrolled manifold.
We show how this concept establishes links between the various
accounts for how movement is organized in redundant effector systems.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Image of the CVF logo with white letters on a blue background&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-1029 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;193&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/06/CVF-logo-300x193.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;With a generous donation of $125,000, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecvf.com/&quot;&gt;The Computer Vision Foundation&lt;/a&gt; becomes &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv’s&lt;/a&gt; first 2021 Gold Affiliate. The foundation fosters and supports research on all aspects of computer vision, a field of study that develops techniques to see and interpret the visual world, with applications ranging from diagnosing disease to evaluating agricultural crop quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t donate because we were asked,” said Ramin Zabih, president and founder of CVF, Cornell Tech professor, and Google research scientist. “We donated because we love arXiv.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open access is a central tenet of the foundation, which (along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ieee.org/&quot;&gt;IEEE&lt;/a&gt;) cosponsors the two main computer vision conferences, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cvpr2021.thecvf.com/&quot;&gt;CVPR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://iccv2021.thecvf.com/home&quot;&gt;ICCV&lt;/a&gt;. Before the pandemic, CVPR drew more than 10,000 attendees. CVF also provides open access to the proceedings for these conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Without arXiv, the computer vision field would not advance at anything close to its current speed,” said Zabih. Conferences and journals are both useful venues for presenting and peer reviewing results. But the pace of research is fast, and arXiv provides an invaluable vehicle for rapid research sharing between conference and journal cycles. Plus, while the high bar for acceptance to conferences and journals serves an important purpose, arXiv provides a platform for lesser-known researchers to make their mark. “High profile researchers will always have ways to share their work, say, by being invited to give talks. arXiv levels the playing field,” said Zabih.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/funding&quot;&gt;arXiv recently launched an updated sustainability model&lt;/a&gt;, which distributes arXiv’s operational costs fairly across our dedicated community. This donation was the first Gold Affiliate through this sustainability model and is a continuation of The Computer Vision Foundation’s support, which began in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like earlier donations from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Heising-Simons Foundation, and Google, Inc, this contribution supports arXiv’s critical infrastructure improvements and integration with the scholarly communications landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“arXiv has been operating in maintenance mode for quite some time,” said Eleonora Presani, arXiv’s executive director. “With generous support from organizations like The Computer Vision Foundation, arXiv can innovate for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<updated>2021-06-15T12:41:38+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although we often think of young children as rather selfish, research has shown that babies and toddlers have a surprisingly strong sense of what is fair. At one year old, kids &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/do-kids-have-a-fundamental-sense-of-fairness/&quot;&gt;already expect resources to be divided fairly&lt;/a&gt; and for people to be helpful towards others. By two, they themselves &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/01/toddlers-have-an-instinct-for-fairness-and-generosity/&quot;&gt;tend to distribute resources equally&lt;/a&gt;, and would rather play with a fair adult than an unfair one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But at what point do young kids actually intervene when they see someone else acting fairly or unfairly? According to a series of studies in &lt;em&gt;Cognition&lt;/em&gt;, before they’re even one and a half years old children will reward someone for being fair — though they don’t yet punish unfair behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42566&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team, led by Talee Ziv from the University of Washington, first trained a group of 16-month-olds to use a touch screen to produce audio clips. Touching one side of the screen resulted in negative feedback (e.g. “She was bad”) while touching the other side produced positive feedback (e.g. “She was good”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The kids then saw four video clips, each showing a woman distributing crackers or Lego blocks to two other people. In two of the clips, the “distributor” divided up the resources fairly, but in the other two she gave one person more than the other (a different actor played the role of distributor in each of the four clips). After watching these videos, the toddlers were again shown the faces of the four distributors, and after seeing each one had 60 seconds to touch the screen as many times as they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that when the children saw the fair distributors, they touched the side of the screen that gave positive feedback significantly more often than the side that gave negative feedback. But when they saw the unfair distributors, there was no difference in the number of times they touched each side of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results suggested that the children were “rewarding” the fair actors with positive feedback. But it wasn’t clear that they really grasped the idea that the audio clips would be rewarding to the actor. So to ensure that the kids understood that their actions produced a clear reward or punishment, in a later study the researchers tweaked the methods so that touching one side of the screen produced a video of someone giving the actor a cookie, while touching the other side produced a video of someone taking a cookie away. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once again, the children rewarded the fair distributors by pressing the “give cookie” side of the screen more often than the “take cookie away” side. But they pressed each side of the screen equally when the distributors had acted unfairly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results suggest that toddlers reward those who are acting fairly, adding to the evidence that very young children have a strong sense of what is “right” or normative. But, interestingly, these kids don’t seem to punish those who have been unfair (in fact, the researchers suggest that the children instead tended to avoid making responses towards unfair distributors, as they touched the screen fewer times overall after seeing those who acted unfairly).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed to understand why toddlers don’t punish unfair actors. They might not see the actions as bad enough to warrant any kind of punishment, the team suggests, or could believe that punishment is only done by people in positions of authority. Or maybe the concept of punishment develops later than that of reward. Either way, the team concludes, the results imply that punishment is not simply the flip side of reward, but that the two are unique processes that may develop differently in children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027721002006&quot;&gt;Toddlers’ interventions toward fair and unfair individuals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Elinor McKone admits that as a junior postdoctoral student, she was unable to recognise her other-race senior professor “by anything other than his coat”. McKone was, then, a perpetrator of the “other-race effect” (ORE) — the (well-documented) fact that we are generally poorer at recognising the faces of people of races other than our own. Now at the Australian National University, McKone has led the first formal investigation into how this phenomenon affects everyday social interactions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12508?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; of students of mostly Chinese heritage, who had recently moved to study in Australia, reveals that both being a victim and a perpetrator makes social interactions more difficult. In fact, the students found it to be as big of a hurdle to successful socialising as the language barrier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42556&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 89 students, all from east and south-east Asia, first completed a computer-based memory task, which measured their individual ability to recognise own-race versus other-race faces. Then they answered questions about how hard they had found it to socialise with White people in Australia and how much cultural or language barriers contributed to these difficulties.  They also indicated the extent to which the other-race effect was a barrier to socialising, both in terms of difficulties the students had had in recognising White people and matching their names to their faces, and in terms of their experience of White students or authority figures (such as tutors) confusing them with other Asian people. Finally, the students reported on how upsetting or difficult they found these experiences. (“Asian” and “White” are used here because these are the terms used by the researchers; they were chosen for being in general use by the students.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the other-race effect made a significant contribution to the students’ reported difficulties in socialising with White people. On the objective face recognition test, those who did worse at recognising other-race compared to own-race faces reported greater difficulties socialising. And participants themselves reported that experiences of being a either a victim or perpetrator of the other-race effect contributed equally to difficulties socialising — so struggles in recognising White people and being mis-recognised as another Asian person were both important. In fact, these experiences were perceived as being as important as the language barrier and only moderately less important than cultural differences. “In sum, these results show international students viewed ORE-related factors… as highly relevant factors to understanding their real-world difficulties socialising with White people,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of the 89% of participants who reported a White authority figure in their lives, 81% said they had had at least some experience of being confused by this person with other Asians. This caused distress and difficulty for 14% of this group. However, around half “largely shrugged off being an ORE victim,” the team writes. The reason for the striking variation in reactions isn’t clear. It might be to do with how frequently a person is confused for someone else, the team suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have looked at how the effect impacts court-room testimony, for example, in making an eye-witness more liable to misidentify someone of a race other than their own. But as the team writes, their new work shows that “it causes real-world problems in &lt;em&gt;common everyday situations experienced by all humans&lt;/em&gt;.” (Their italics.) And there are various further potential implications. If people cannot recognise other-race faces, they may choose to socialise more with people of their own race, encouraging segregation. Clearly, much more research is needed to understand the everyday impacts of this effect. And as effective strategies to combat it have so far proved elusive, there’s an urgent need for further study in this area, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12508&quot;&gt;Why the other-race effect matters: Poor recognition of other-race faces impacts everyday social interactions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 Abstract:  The goal of the open access (OA) movement is to help everyone access the scholarly research, not just those who can afford to. However, most studies looking at whether OA has met this goal have focused on whether other scholars are making use of OA research. Few have considered how the broader public, including the news media, uses OA research. This study sought to answer whether the news media mentions OA articles more or less than paywalled articles by looking at articles published from 2010 through 2018 in journals across all four quartiles of the Journal Impact Factor using data obtained through Altmetric.com and the Web of Science. Gold, green and hybrid OA articles all had a positive correlation with the number of news mentions received. News mentions for OA articles did see a dip in 2018, although they remained higher than those for paywalled articles.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;So far I was very fortunate with my scientific long-term mentors and supervisors: both of them are kind, open, creative and stunningly intelligent. I could not wish for more. However, when asked about a role model, I would mention a person that influenced my take on research, during a time when I still was studying physics, probably more than others: Pina Bausch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pina Bausch was a dancer and choreographer who mostly worked in the small town of Wuppertal, Germany, where she developed her own way of modern dance. Her works are creative and inventive in very unexpected ways, and the way she explored body movements as a dancer struck me as surprisingly similar to what I think is “research”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6839&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6839&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;pinabausch&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/pinabausch.png?w=592&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/pinabausch.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/pinabausch.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;592,463&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/pinabausch/&quot; height=&quot;499&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/pinabausch.png?w=592&quot; width=&quot;638&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research in its purest form is the exploration of the unknown, the discovery of what is not yet discovered, without a clear path ahead. The question that I’m working on in the broadest sense, “How does the brain work?”, enters the unknown very quickly as soon as you take the question seriously. How, in general, can we see what cannot be seen yet, how can we find ideas that do not yet exist?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pina Bausch was a master in this art. Her craft was not science or biology but dancing, but I think one can learn some lessons from her. It was typical of her to explore her own movements and to “invent” new movements, like wrist movements or coordinated movements of elbows and the head, or simply a slowed-down or delayed movement of the fingers. In regular life we use a rather limited and predefined combination of motor actions, and it takes some creativity to come up with movements that are unexpected and new but still interesting. One way to find new ways to move would be to consciously become aware of the own patterns and limitations and then try to systematically break those rules. However, Pina Bausch performed this discovery process in a different way. Her research was not guided by intellectual deduction or conclusion, but by her intuition. In 1992, she said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ich weiß nämlich immer, wonach ich suche, aber ich weiß es eher mit meinem Gefühl als mit meinem Kopf.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Because I always know what I’m searching for. But I know it with my heart and with my feeling rather than with my brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This might come over as a bit naive at first glance. Sure, an artist uses her heart, a scientist uses his brain, that sounds more or less normal, doesn’t it? However, when I saw Pina Bausch do this kind of searching, that is, when she danced, I was very impressed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She seemed to rely on her intuition on every single moment of her explorations; and when I heard her talk about it (unfortunately, I’m only aware of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f04Tk1pqQok&quot;&gt;interviews in German&lt;/a&gt; without translation), it was also clear that she did not have and did not need an explanation of what was going on. Most impressively for me, her way of exploring the unknown really struck me as similar to what is going on in a researcher, no matter the subject. What made her such an excellent researcher?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To me, it seems that the prerequisites of her impressive ability are the following: First of all, of course, a deeply engrained knowledge of and skill with her art, together with a honest care about the details. There’s no intuition without experience and knowledge. Second, an openness to whatever random things might happen and to accept them, coming from the outside or her inside. Third, an acceptance of the fact that she doesn’t really know what she’s doing. Or, to put this differently, a certain humility in the face of what is going to happen and what is going on in her own subconsciousness. I believe that these are qualities that also make for a good researcher in science.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also reflects my own experience of doing research (at least partially). Even when I was working with mathematical tools, for example when I was modeling diffusion processes in inhomogeneous media during my diploma thesis, I had the impression that my intuition was always a couple of steps ahead of myself. Often I could see the shape of the mathematical goal ahead of my derivations, and it would take me several days before I could bring it down to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course there are other ways to develop new ideas, and for some problems intuition also fails systematically (maybe complex systems?). And of course there are other kinds of research, for example the gradual optimization of methods, or the development of devices to solve a specific problem, or the broad and systematic screening of candidate genes or materials for a defined purpose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These systematic and step-wise procedures are more predictable than “pure” research, and the grant-based scientific research reinforces this kind of research. In a grant proposal, there are typically a defined number of “aims”. The more clearly defined these aims are, the better the chances of the grant proposal to be accepted. This makes sense. It would be ridiculous to fund a project with loosely defined aims, especially if other, competing proposals have a clear and realistic goal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, this necessary side-effect of grant-based research narrows our perspective on a kind of research that can be more or less clearly described even before doing it. It narrows down also the way how we talk about research and about results. We do not directly encourage young researchers to use and develop their intuition, as if this had nothing to do with the scientific process. In grants and progress reports and talks and papers, we try to use very concise, precise language, sharp and clean as steel (often completed by pieces of superficial math that are supposed to demonstrate precision), not only when describing our methods – but also when describing results and when interpreting the results. This is not bad by itself, but it shapes also the way we think about research, and it can lead to a situation where we internally might reject ideas or results that do not satisfy the desired clarity and cleanliness in a first step. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think that also researchers in “hard” sciences like neuroscience could benefit from a technique that uses intuitive thinking, and at least I have learnt a lot from the way Pina Bausch approached her subject of study using these techniques. Ultimately, understanding in neuroscience should always aim for descriptions in terms of words or math. But the way towards this goal does not need to be guided by these clear ways of thinking alone. From my experience, the power of intuition is only unleashed if we accept that we cannot really understand the process itself. Therefore, I see the humility that Pina Bausch showed towards her own intuitive thought process not simply as a simple virtue of a human being, but rather as a tool and a way of thinking that enables creativity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New work is providing fascinating insights into aphantasia, a condition where you are unable to see images with your mind’s eye. &lt;/strong&gt;There even appears to be a flip side to the condition, hyperphantasia, where mental imagery is particularly powerful. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/08/science/minds-eye-mental-pictures-psychology.html&quot;&gt;Carl Zimmer examines the new findings&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; (and see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/03/bonus-episode-whats-it-like-to-have-no-minds-eye/&quot;&gt;our podcast&lt;/a&gt; on aphantasia from 2019).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42538&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/why-its-difficult-for-children-to-understand-sarcasm-160915&quot;&gt;Penny Paxman explains&lt;/a&gt; why children don’t fully grasp sarcasm until they are around seven to ten years old. &lt;/strong&gt;Understanding why someone is being sarcastic relies on quite sophisticated cognitive processes — not just those directly related to language, but also the ability to empathise and think about another person’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tamer breeds of cattle tend to have smaller brains,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/06/tamer-cow-smaller-brain&quot;&gt;reports Michael Price&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. The researchers think that because humans have selectively bred beef and dairy cows to be calm and gentle, over time the brain areas involved in aggression have shrunk. The work is consistent with other studies finding that domesticated dogs, pigs and other animals have smaller brains that their wild counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurological and psychiatric symptoms are common even in mild cases of COVID-19, a review of studies has found. &lt;/strong&gt;Loss of taste or smell, weakness and fatigue were each reported by around half of those who had COVID-19 but weren’t hospitalised, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2279780-many-people-with-covid-19-have-neurological-or-psychiatric-symptoms/?utm_campaign=RSS%7CNSNS&amp;amp;utm_source=NSNS&amp;amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;amp;utm_content=news&quot;&gt;according to a story&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroscientists think that for our brains to represent the world accurately, a similar pattern of neurons must fire whenever we have the same perceptual experience. &lt;/strong&gt;So a new study has left researchers puzzled, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/06/the-brain-isnt-supposed-to-change-this-much/619145/?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;writes Ed Yong&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic. &lt;/em&gt;The team found that when mice sniffed the same smell over a period of weeks, the group of cells in the smell-identifying region of their brains gradually changed, so that a month later it was almost a completely different set of neurons from that at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, at &lt;em&gt;BBC Worklife&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210608-how-to-train-your-personality-to-re-enter-the-world&quot;&gt;our former editor Christian Jarrett discusses&lt;/a&gt; how you can change your personality to cope with the imminent return to the workplace. &lt;/strong&gt;Also &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/05/18/episode-25-how-to-change-your-personality/&quot;&gt;check out our recent podcast&lt;/a&gt;, in which I discuss the science of personality change with Christian.&lt;/p&gt;

We are hearing from the Editorial Board Members of the BMC Series journals whose work aligns with achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Here you can find other posts in this collection, grouped with the tag ‘SDG editorial board members‘.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actively advancing the SDGs – an exciting, challenging and rewarding journey  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tod&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12430&quot; height=&quot;170&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/SDG2-300x170.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;ay’s societal challenges are complex. Tackling the complexity requires that researchers with diverse backgrounds actively work together. Transdisciplinary research provides exciting opportunities to unravel the complexity and explore solutions. Over the past two decades, I have been privileged to work at the interface of these challenges – at the global, African and country-level. I have also trained a cadre of professionals in adopting transdisciplinary mindsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research and policy work focuses primarily on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/&quot;&gt;SDG 2&lt;/a&gt; that seeks to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. However, this SDG touches all other SDGs and underpins the human rights fundamental to achieving all other SDGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant challenge in working on SDG2 is the diverse understandings of its components. I have found that the essential starting point is to make sure everyone around the table understands what we are discussing – in meetings with communities, policymakers or researchers. Assuming everyone is on the same page is a monumental mistake. Even in the international domain, SDG2 is often incorrectly labelled ‘ending hunger’ – only one element of SDG2. Hunger is an extreme (acute) form of food insecurity but also includes other outcomes such as malnutrition and the complexities of the coexistence of undernourishment and obesity in poor communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these misconceptions relate to views that food security relates only to production rather than considering the inter-linked core elements of food security: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/3/ca9731en/ca9731en.pdf&quot;&gt;availability, access, nutrition, resilience, agency and sustainability&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, this 1970’s production perspective has changed with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03031853.2018.1479974&quot;&gt;deeper understanding of food insecurity and its causes&lt;/a&gt;. Malnutrition is often understood as undernutrition rather than embracing all forms of malnutrition: undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies (often termed ‘hidden hunger’) and overweight (including obesity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, food security is &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12571-015-0457-6.pdf&quot;&gt;not a static condition&lt;/a&gt;. Households can become more or less food insecure over time or seasons. Simultaneously achieving the four inter-linked elements of the SDG2 is the focus of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/en/food-systems-summit&quot;&gt;September 2021 United Nations Food Systems Summit&lt;/a&gt;. All four elements of SDG2 are outcomes of sustainable food systems but require specific actions to ensure that the elements of food systems work together to deliver on SDG2. The food systems approach provide ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/en/food-systems-summit/action-tracks&quot;&gt;lenses’&lt;/a&gt; to examine the effectiveness of food system components and stakeholders. Food systems approaches can help identify opportunities to address failures and tradeoffs in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of study related to SDG2 is changing rapidly, making research in this field exciting, challenging and rewarding.  Working in this field has led to opportunities to work with diverse international transdisciplinary teams. From these treasured engagements, I have learnt an enormous amount about many topics that touch on, underly and shape research on SDG2. These opportunities have included drafting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.interacademies.org/publication/opportunities-future-research-and-innovation-food-and-nutrition-security-and&quot;&gt;consensus reports&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiNvN2O14zxAhXGiVwKHb5TDu4QFjAAegQIAhAD&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mamopanel.org%2Fresources%2FNutrition%2Freports-and-briefings%2Fnourished-how-africa-can-build-future-free-hunger2%2F&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1Mmaru-77mGAncdaz1WLfB&quot;&gt;regional&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/cfs/cfs-hlpe/hlpe-reports/en/&quot;&gt;international foci&lt;/a&gt; to direct scientific input into international processes such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.48565/scfss2021-wg92&quot;&gt;United Nations Food Systems Summit preparation&lt;/a&gt; to embarking on &lt;a href=&quot;https://sc-fss2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/UNFSS_true_cost_of_food.pdf&quot;&gt;challenging research analysis&lt;/a&gt; with relatively large teams of international experts. My work enabled participation in the drafting of the United Nations High-Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition, which first &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3901e.pdf&quot;&gt;defined food systems in 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through these opportunities, one learns how to share your own knowledge in a way that others outside of your field of expertise can understand while building your own knowledge from the engagement with others. Such engagement requires flexibility in thinking and the willingness to expand your scope of knowledge. It requires a great deal of listening and learning – something that does not come naturally to Professors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are only nine years left before the end of the SDG era (2016 – 2030), we still have so much to learn about how to face, embrace and overcome the complexity of the issues related to SDG2. I believe that the opportunities afforded by the digital connectivity during the COVID pandemic have helped significantly advance our understanding of SDG2 in the context of food systems. The continual engagement by a range of stakeholders with the UN Food Systems Summit preparation has enabled the identification of ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/en/food-systems-summit/news/food-systems-game-changers-reflections&quot;&gt;game changing’&lt;/a&gt; solutions to advance progress on the SDGs. These solutions offer guidance on the future directions for researchers committed to supporting progress on the SDGs and SDG2 in particular. There are also opportunities for researchers to track the implementation and effectiveness of the solutions chosen by food systems stakeholders – albeit countries or the private sector. Stepping up to these opportunities will inform progress towards 2030 and provide the evidence base to inform the subsequent development era (post the SDGs).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For many, moving out of the family home is a rite of passage, a sign that adulthood is just about to begin. Equally, however, there are plenty of reasons why somebody might move back &lt;em&gt;in &lt;/em&gt;with their parents: after a break-up, to save money, for health reasons, or to care for ageing or unwell relatives. Anecdotally, the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have been another reason for such a move, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/11/11/adult-children-move-back-parents-pandemic-costing-425-month/&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/mar/18/ill-cherish-these-moments-how-covid-has-swelled-the-boomerang-generation&quot;&gt;proliferating&lt;/a&gt; on children once more living with their parents and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/adult-children-parents-home-pandemic/2021/01/18/3e55ef70-5696-11eb-a817-e5e7f8a406d6_story.html&quot;&gt;offering advice&lt;/a&gt; on how to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But how do such “boomerang kids” frame their decision to move back home, and how do they ensure it goes well? A &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/21676968211012584&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Emerging Adulthood&lt;/em&gt; finds four strategies young people use to make the transition back into the family home as positive as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42532&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were 31 young adults, aged between 18 and 35, who had moved back into the family home. Researchers interviewed the participants on their experiences, before conducting an analysis of the data to pull out the key themes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The analysis found an overarching concern for boomerang kids: framing their move as an “investment in the future” rather than something to be ashamed of. Multiple participants acknowledged the stigma of moving back home, with one expressing that it “made me feel insecure in my success… that others may judge me for it”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This stigma, however, was frequently turned on its head and reframed as a positive decision for the future: participants mentioned the financial security it had given them, the increased likelihood of returning to university or graduate school due to this security, and the opportunity to get advice and support from parents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also pulled out four communication strategies that participants used to navigate the move back home in a way that both reduced the experience of stigma and allowed them to have adult relationships with their parents. The first was to develop clear expectations with their parents in order to assert boundaries and set out what living together would look like in reality. Those discussions revolved around topics like curfews, meal times, chores, and other responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, all participants saw contributions to the household as an important factor in destigmatising the move back home and making sure relationships worked well. These contributions included cooking, running errands, paying rent and doing other practical tasks, as well as making emotional contributions by listening to parents and sharing feelings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants also indicated that it was important to make sure that parents knew the move was only temporary, and in some cases they shared a specific timeline. One participant noted the importance of “having a next step”: “I told them it would be a two year commitment and we’re pretty much on track for that.” This also helped with cultural stigma and shame: seeing the move as a time-bound transition period helped participants accept their move and frame it as a logical step.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, participants stressed that engaging in “mature, responsible, adult behaviour” was key: waking up early, setting and keeping to routines and responsibilities, and functioning independently. For some, this stopped them from reverting back to their “child identity” when living at home, and established an adult relationship with parents that differed in dynamic from child or teen years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although family relationships will clearly differ from unit to unit, particularly when factoring in different geographies and cultural expectations, overall the interviews provide good insight not only into the reality of moving home, but into how to actually navigate it as well. Future research could look more closely at the &lt;em&gt;differences&lt;/em&gt; in people’s experiences, and how this relates to personality type, background, and other individual factors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/21676968211012584&quot;&gt;A Normative Approach to Understanding How “Boomerang Kids” Communicatively Negotiate Moving Back Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Michael Schmuker will talk about a paper &quot;Feed-Forward and Noise-Tolerant Detection of Feature Homogeneity in Spiking Networks with a Latency Code&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In studies of the visual system as well as in computer vision, the
focus is often on contrast edges. However, the primate visual system
contains a large number of cells that are insensitive to spatial
contrast and, instead, respond to uniform homogeneous illumination of
their visual field. The purpose of this information remains unclear.
Here, we propose a mechanism that detects feature homogeneity in
visual areas, based on latency coding and spike time coincidence, in a
purely feedforward and therefore rapid manner. We demonstrate how
homogeneity information can interact with information on contrast
edges to potentially support rapid image segmentation. Furthermore, we
analyze how neuronal crosstalk (noise) affects the mechanism's
performance. We show that the detrimental effects of crosstalk can be
partly mitigated through delayed feed-forward inhibition that shapes
bi-phasic postsynaptic events. The delay of the feed-forward
inhibition allows effectively controlling the size of the temporal
integration window and, thereby, the coincidence threshold. The
proposed model is based on single-spike latency codes in a purely
feed-forward architecture that supports low-latency processing, making
it an attractive scheme of computation in spiking neuronal networks
where rapid responses and low spike counts are desired.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;For the past few months, I’ve been working on a machine learning research project, which I just submitted to NeurIPS. The scale is, all things considered, fairly small: the output limited to one paper and a handful of figures. Yet, I still needed to distribute the work along a mini-cluster in the cloud, keep track of thousands of different experiments, track key performance metrics over time, and integrate a half-dozen datasets and a dozen models. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At that scale, it’s pretty easy to shoot yourself in the foot: introduce a data loading error that invalidates your results, forget to keep track of which parameters you used for which experiment you ran months ago, have a figure that’s not easily reproducible because the steps to reproduce the figure have been lost through the sands of time, etc. &lt;a href=&quot;https://paperswithcode.com/trends&quot;&gt;25% of papers in machine learning actually publish their code&lt;/a&gt;, and I have a feeling that a big chunk of the other 75% is because people hesitate to share their messy creations, or the code is so brittle that it self-destroys as soon as you see it and they don’t want to support it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s the stack that I used for this project, the reason I took some decisions, and some lessons I learned. I think that the organization I show here is appropriate for small research teams like academic labs and early-stage startups. Some of this is a little pedestrian, but I hope you learn a thing or two. Let me know about your experiences in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Decision points&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Local vs. cloud&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/&quot;&gt;Full Stack Deep Learning&lt;/a&gt; class from Berkeley is a good place to learn how to organize deep learning projects. I had originally intended to go all-in on cloud infra to run models and analyze data. The class makes a solid argument that it ends being cheaper to build your own machine for local testing, then scale on the cloud as needed. I had a several years old deep learning rig with a 1080 Titan lying around, so I ended up wiping the drive and installing Ubuntu 20 on it for local bleeding edge development. I would then push the code to github when the code was ready to be scaled and run on cloud infra. Having a local dev machine doesn’t mean you’re locked to that place: you can still set up remote ssh access, but given that it was winter and we were on lockdown I never had a reason to do it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I had spent far too many afternoons figuring out (and yelling at and crying about) kubernetes on Google Cloud last year, so for this project I decided to avoid managing cloud infra by using a managed on-demand service. I wanted a central server where I could submit a batch job and it would provision the right machine to run the job and store the results somewhere in the cloud. Importantly, I wanted it set up in a way that I wouldn’t have to pay for a central server, only for the workers. I ended up using &lt;strong&gt;paperspace gradient&lt;/strong&gt; for this purpose, which at the time, had cheap prices for GPU instances, and offered a straightforward product called &lt;em&gt;experiments&lt;/em&gt; which was meant for exactly the purpose I wanted. This setup worked great for the first 3 months, but then Gradient changed their product to focus on a more turnkey solution, and from that point on the original product stopped working properly (multiple jobs would hang, you couldn’t find jobs from the interface, customer support was abysmal). Next time, I will try &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/batch/&quot;&gt;AWS Batch&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps I will dip my toe into SageMaker to get access to a cloud jupyter notebook for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Code organization&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One unexpected advantage of using this hybrid local/cloud setup is that it immediately imposed a certain discipline on the project: gradient runs your code inside a &lt;strong&gt;docker&lt;/strong&gt; container, so you have to have a docker container ready, hence you are documenting your dependencies as you go along. I used the Pytorch docker container base and kept adding dependencies as needed, and used dockerhub to build the containers in the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This setup also imposes a workflow that focuses on creating batch jobs as Python scripts as opposed to jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks are great for analysis, but building models in jupyter notebook is a bad idea – you pollute your global namespace, you risk running cells out of order, the editor has poor introspection so won’t tell you if you reference a variable that doesn’t exist following a long script, etc. I much prefer writing models and batch scripts in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;VSCode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, using &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&quot;&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as an autoformatter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re used to a jupyter-notebook-based workflow, you’re probably used to writing small snippets of code, testing them in the cell on a handful of inputs, then lifting the code to a function which then you can integrate into the larger notebook narrative. With a batch-based workflow you lose this fast feedback process. The key to getting back that productivity – and then some – is to switch to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/testing.html&quot;&gt;test-driven development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Rather than informally testing snippets of your code in jupyter notebook, you create a separate test suite that calls the functions in your Python script and checks that their output is as expected. This forces you to write reasonably clean code with small functions that don’t have a lot of side effects. In practice, I didn’t aim for 100% code coverage, but instead focused on tests for data loaders and models. Testable code is also much easier to refactor, because you can easily see if you broke you code by re-running the test suite. Each test should only take a few milliseconds to run.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I enabled &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/about-continuous-integration&quot;&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt; (CI)&lt;/strong&gt; in the Github repo to run my pytest suite via nose2 every time I pushed code. Unfortunately, a lot of that code depended on having GPU access on Github, which would have become expensive, so I didn’t end up using it. It does look like it’s possible to run test suites on a GPU-enabled machine via &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/drelleobrien/how-to-use-github-actions-with-your-gpu-4f1g&quot;&gt;nvidia-docker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I used an ad-hoc project folder structure inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/index.html&quot;&gt;PyRSE&lt;/a&gt;. Elizabeth DuPre told me about cookiecutter, which allows one to create projects from templates. &lt;a href=&quot;https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/&quot;&gt;I ended up using the &lt;strong&gt;datascience cookiecutter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a subset of the project, and generally I liked it (although it is a bit too nested for my taste).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;TF vs. PyTorch&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ve used TF in the past, but I decided to use &lt;strong&gt;PyTorch&lt;/strong&gt; this round, since a lot of the models I wanted to test were released in PyTorch. The PyTorch documentation is excellent. A surprising chunk of my codebase ended up being training loops, so for next time I will consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/&quot;&gt;PyTorch Lightning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Storing results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One thing I never really spent time thinking about in grad school is how to store results. I have folders and folders in an old DropBox that are filled to the brim with mat files with long names from gosh knows what experiment. The problem with such ad hoc results storage is that you don’t know how the results were generated, because the results and the code are not linked. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you’d like to store results in a centralized location with the following features:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;each result comes with metadata about how the result was generated (command line parameters, git hash, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you can safely delete stale results&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you can query results to find the subet which you’re interested in&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you can visualize metadata about the results in graphical form (dashboard)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You could implement these functionalities yourself, for example with a local mongo database instance to store the results, and a dashboard of your creation, but I ended up instead using &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wandb.ai/&quot;&gt;Weights and Biases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (wandb). This turned out to be a great idea, highly recommended. In your code, you push your results along with metadata to their server using a simple library that you can pip install. The library takes care of adding the git hash to the payload so you know what code generated the result. You can also use the libary to send and store weights, images, checkpoints, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get a fully customizable dashboard built on vega-lite to keep track of your results. To retrieve your results, you use mongodb queries, so you can filter results by whatever property you desire. To have meaningful properties to query, I specify command line arguments to my training scripts via &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html&quot;&gt;argparse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, for instance number of filters, learning rate, epochs, etc. Then I send the argparse arguments to wandb when I save my results. That way I can easily filter by learning rate, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Locally, I do still use &lt;strong&gt;tensorboard&lt;/strong&gt; to babysit my networks, especially with a new network when it’s not clear whether the training will converge or not. I find that tensorboard is good to diagnose one model, but it’s not great to keep track of multiple models (say, more than 5) – pretty soon all you see is a mess of training curves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Analyzing results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;strong&gt;jupyterlab&lt;/strong&gt; locally to analyze my results. One thing that I don’t like about jupyter notebooks is that it doesn’t play well with git – the diffs are meaningless. I will try out &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext&quot;&gt;jupytext&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows to write jupyter notebooks as plain text. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Mistakes I made&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I accumulated a lot of technical debt around a seemingly innocuous decision about data storage. I downloaded brain data in ad hoc formats from multiple public sources (crcns), and I originally wrote a PyTorch data loader for each data source. That meant that for every new brain dataset I wanted to integrate, I would write a new data loader, which would take care of filtering out bad records, splitting the data into train and test set, and transforming it into the format that PyTorch expected. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That worked fine for the first 2 or 3 datasets, but pretty soon it became a liability. The ad-hoc formats were not always designed for rapid loading – some datasets were really slow to load because they used small block sizes in hdf5. Other datasets needed some manual curation. What I needed is an intermediate format – I would preprocess the datasets into the intermediate format once, and then load the intermediate format in the data loaders. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I should have done&lt;/strong&gt; is have one true intermediate format – e.g. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nwb.org/&quot;&gt;NWB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – I should also have decided train/test splits during the preprocessing. The data needed to be in a &lt;strong&gt;FAIR&lt;/strong&gt; format in the intermediate stage – it needed, especially to be interopable. What I ended up doing is having a bunch of ad hoc intermediate formats – I would minimally preprocess the data and save it in a format parallel to the original one. Ultimately, that meant having to make a lot of micro decisions (e.g. how do I specify the train/test splits – two datasets, or one dataset and two sets of indices?) that I made inconsistently across datasets, and it became a mess that I never bothered fixing. My test suite for loaders ballooned as I had to cover for corner cases for every loader. Doing it over again, I would find settle on one true intermediate format.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I experimented a bit with using &lt;strong&gt;make&lt;/strong&gt; to create the intermediate format, and I think it’s a great solution for this use case. make will create intermediate results if they don’t exist but won’t try to recreate them if they’re already there; an ideal solution to manage complex pipelines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Releasing code and models&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I didn’t really think much about making the code easy to run for others, but when it came time to release it (for reviewers), it only took me about a half day to clean up the codebase and write docs. The code was already logically organized, the dependencies documented, most everything ran automatically with bash scripts, so all in all it was much less trouble to release than a typical project I would have undertook in grad school. That being said, I would like to release the model in an easy-to-use way. It’s unfortunate that huggingface models are restricted to transformer models, that would have been ideal. I was recently made aware of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/replicate/cog&quot;&gt;cog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which aims to make model releases easy, complete with docker environment and downloadable weights. The weights themselves can be stored on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://figshare.com/&quot;&gt;figshare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (free bandwidth!)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Keep/change/try&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-table&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Keep&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Change&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Try (more)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pytorch&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Paperspace -&amp;gt; AWS batch&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Jupytext&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;wandb&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ad hoc intermediate format -&amp;gt; NWB&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Make&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mixed local/cloud development&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Google Cloud Storage -&amp;gt; S3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Data science cookie cutter&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;vscode&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;PyTorch Lightning&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Test-driven development&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;cog&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Black&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;SageMaker&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Docker&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Physically attractive people are routinely judged to be “superior” in other ways — to be more trustworthy, for example, and honest, and intelligent. However, evidence for the unwarranted “attractiveness halo” effect has tended to come from studies that have involved snap-judgements with no feedback or repercussions for the people doing the judging. Gayathri Pandey and Vivian Zayas at Cornell University, US, wanted to explore how this bias plays out in the longer term, when contradicted by actual data. If, say, we’re given information that an attractive investor is actually losing us money, while an unattractive investor is securing profits, surely we’ll quickly drop that bias in relation to these individual people at least? Alarmingly, the pair’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12495?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Psychology&lt;/em&gt; suggests not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42524&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an initial study, 91 students were each shown four photos of purported “financial partners” (all of the same gender). Two of the composite faces had independently been rated as attractive and two as unattractive. The students were given a hypothetical $2000 and told to make as much money as possible. Across 50 trials with all male partners and another 50 with all female partners, they had to click on a face to choose one with whom to invest the money, and each time, they got feedback as to whether they’d lost or gained money.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before they started, the students were informed that some of the partners would be more helpful than others. They were also encouraged to try them all, to find out which were better and which worse. What they were not told was that there were in fact two equally disadvantageous partners (who delivered some relatively large immediate gains but smaller long-term profits or even long-term losses) — one attractive and one unattractive — and two advantageous partners (who conferred better long-term profits), again, one attractive and one not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As expected, the students started out favouring the attractive partners. But even after receiving 50 trials’ worth of feedback about the performance of each individual, they were still swayed by attractiveness. In fact, they preferred the attractive-&lt;em&gt;disadvantageous&lt;/em&gt; partner over the unattractive-&lt;em&gt;advantageous &lt;/em&gt;partner. They also reported finding the attractive partners more helpful. (There was some evidence of improved performance in the second block of trials, though the team’s analysis suggests that this reflected better use of the feedback, rather than getting significantly better at discounting attractiveness.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps 50 trials weren’t enough for the participants to accurately discriminate between helpful vs unhelpful partners, and discount attractiveness, the researchers reasoned. So they ran another experiment, this time with 135 participants who each completed 100 trials (with either all male or all female partners).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results were different — but not drastically so. As the participants progressed through the 100 rounds of feedback, they did come to show a preference for the advantageous partners. However, after suffering a loss, they were still quicker to return to an attractive vs unattractive partner, and by the end, the attractive-disadvantageous partner was still &lt;em&gt;as popular&lt;/em&gt; a choice as the unattractive-advantageous one. “Even with more opportunity to learn about partners’ profitability, time did not appreciably moderate the effect of attractiveness,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The participants were asked afterwards about how trustworthy they perceived the four partners to be. The attractive two were clearly favoured. In fact, the researchers’ analysis suggests that a perceived association between attractiveness and trustworthiness explained the results — we seem to use attractiveness as a signal of trustworthiness, and rely on it, even in the face of financial losses (albeit hypothetical ones).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s possible of course that with more trials, which could provide a clearer picture of trends in financial gains and losses, the attractiveness bias would have been eliminated. Only further research will tell. And as the researchers themselves note, a study that involved American college students, just White faces and hypothetical rather than real money is only a starting point for research in this area, rather than the final word. However, the new work certainly does suggest that the attractiveness halo colours our judgements, at a cost to ourselves, for far longer than might have been assumed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12495?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;What is a face worth? Facial attractiveness biases experience-based monetary decision-making&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The Software Working Group is holding three beginner/intermediate level tutorials at the upcoming &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CNS&lt;/span&gt;*2021 Online conference. These will cover using the command line (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/&quot;&gt;Bash&lt;/a&gt;), using &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://git-scm.com&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, and development in the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://python.org&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To attend these, and other tutorials at &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2021&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CNS&lt;/span&gt;*2021&lt;/a&gt;, please register for the conference &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2021-registration-fees&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;effective-use-of-bash&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Effective use of Bash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instructor(s): Felix B. Kern (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/kernfel&quot;&gt;@kernfel&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date/Time: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=CNS%2A2021%3A+Effective+use+of+Bash&amp;amp;iso=20210628T08&amp;amp;p1=179&amp;amp;ah=3&quot;&gt;28 June, 2021 1200 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce participants to the tools they need in order to comfortably and confidently work with a Unix/Linux command line terminal.
Unlike graphical user interfaces, which are often self-explanatory or have obvious built-in help options, the purely text-based nature of a command line terminal can be intimidating and confusing to novice users.
Yet, once mastered, the command line offers more flexibility and smoother workflows for many tasks, while being entirely irreplaceable for things such as cluster access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we aim to introduce participants to the concepts and tools they need to confidently operate within a Unix/Linux command line environment.
In particular, the tutorial is developed for Bash (as per the title), which should cover most Linux and MacOS* use cases.
We hope to provide participants with a firm understanding of the basics of using a shell, as well as an understanding of the advantages of working from a command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutorial is aimed not only at novices who have rarely or never used a command line, but also at occasional or even regular users of bash who seek to expand or refresh their repertoire of everyday commands and the kinds of quality-of-life tricks and shortcuts that are rarely covered on StackExchange questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* While MacOS has switched from &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt; as its default shell, &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quo&quot;&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;s operation is sufficiently similar for the purposes of this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A working copy of bash; participants on Linux and MacOS are all set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants on Windows have several options to get hold of a bash environment without leaving familiar territory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gitforwindows.org/&quot;&gt;Git for Windows&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a Git Bash emulation with most of the standard tools you might expect in a Linux/Unix environment, plus of course Git.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternatively, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux&quot;&gt;enable &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WSL2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6&quot;&gt;install Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; as a virtual machine hosted by Windows. Somewhat ironically, this requires at least one use of a command line terminal (though not bash); on the upside, the Linux-on-Windows experience can be a smooth and safe first step into Linux territory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basics to refer back to: Operating your bash shell (with key bindings and patience)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The grammar of a shell command line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting around: navigating within and beyond your computer: &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pwd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pushd&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;popd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeing what’s there: &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;, globbing, and strategies for naming your files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File system manipulations: &lt;code&gt;mv&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cp&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rmdir&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ln -s&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;touch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking into files: &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;amp&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;more&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;diff&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text manipulation: &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;uniq&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cut&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;column&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Putting things together: piping and redirection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to do when stuck: &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt;, I need some &lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt; here &lt;code&gt;apropos&lt;/code&gt; of this command…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;effective-use-of-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Effective use of Git&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instructor(s): Ankur Sinha (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/sanjayankur31&quot;&gt;@sanjayankur31&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date/time: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=CNS%2A2021%3A+Effective+use+of+Git&amp;amp;iso=20210628T13&amp;amp;p1=179&amp;amp;ah=3&quot;&gt;June 28, 2021 1700 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version control is a necessary skill that users writing any amount of code should possess.
Git is a popular version control tool that is used ubiquitously in software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hands-on session is aimed at beginners who have little or no experience with version control systems and Git.
It will introduce the basics of version control and walk through a common daily Git workflow before moving on to show how Git is used for collaborative development on popular Git forges such as GitHub.
Finally, it will show some advanced features of Git that aid in debugging code errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session is intended to be a hands-on session, so all attendees will be expected to run Git commands.
A working installation of Git is, therefore, required for this session.
We will use GitHub as our Git remote for forking and pull/merge requests.
So a GitHub account will also be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Linux users can generally install Git from their default package manager:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fedora: &lt;code&gt;sudo dnf install git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu: &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows users should use &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gitforwindows.org/&quot;&gt;Git for Windows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MacOS users should use &lt;code&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt; to install &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;brew install git&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is amongst the most widely used programming languages today, and is increasingly popular in the scientific domain.
A large number of tools and simulators in use currently are either implemented in Python, or offer interfaces for their use via Python.
Python programming is therefore a very sought after skill in the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial is targeted towards people who have some experience with programming languages (e.g. &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MATLAB&lt;/span&gt;, C, C++, etc), but are relatively new to Python.
It is structured to have you quickly up-and-running, giving you a feel of how things work in Python.
We shall begin by demonstrating how to setup and manage virtual environments on your system, to help you keep multiple projects isolated.
We’ll show you how to install Python packages in virtual environments and how to manage them.
This will be followed by a quick overview of very basic Python constructs, leading finally to a neuroscience-themed project that will give you the opportunity to bring together various programming concepts with some hands-on practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shell (participants on Linux and MacOS are all set; see below for Windows users)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python 3.6.9 or higher (see below for info on installation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants on Windows have several options to get hold of a shell environment without leaving familiar territory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gitforwindows.org/&quot;&gt;Git for Windows&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a Git Bash emulation with most of the standard tools you might expect in a Linux/Unix environment, plus of course Git.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternatively, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux&quot;&gt;enable &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WSL2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6&quot;&gt;install Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; as a virtual machine hosted by Windows. This Linux-on-Windows experience can be a smooth and safe first step into Linux territory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find several resources online for info on installing Python. e.g. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://realpython.com/installing-python/&quot;&gt;https://realpython.com/installing-python/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up and managing virtual environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing packages using PyPI (&lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;) and from Git repositories (e.g. GitHub)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick Python 101 - lists, dicts, if…else, loops, functions, error handling, import, help, numpy, matplotlib&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short neuroscience-themed project - modularizing the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good practices - lint (Flake8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The University of Cape Town (UCT) in South Africa is in a prime location to conduct oceanographic research and features a wealth of scientific expertise. However, as in many institutions, the pool of oceanographic researchers can be quite homogenous. UCT researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://katyealtieri.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Katye Altieri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Fawcett&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sarah Fawcett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maris.uct.ac.za/ma-re/members/academic/ansorge&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Isabelle Ansorge&lt;/a&gt; realized that while the academic staff in the Department of Oceanography at UCT is comprised of ~50% womxn, it is 100% white. Furthermore, in 2019, amongst postgraduates in the department, there were only 12 Black African and Coloured South African womxn out of 73 students. The barriers that prevent higher representation of Black womxn in oceanography and climate science are numerous and include financial restrictions and lack of resources or training opportunities. The feeling of ‘otherness’ can also prevent Black womxn from feeling like a part of the research community. Altieri says that she and her colleagues saw an opportunity to create “a dedicated programme that offers field work preparation, mentorship and support for black womxn so they can become future leaders of oceanography in South Africa and the global south”. The three womxn joined forces with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saeon.ac.za/enewsleter-archives/2011/february2011/doc05&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Juliet Hermes&lt;/a&gt; from the South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON), and they decided to apply for a grant from the Advancing Womxn initiative, created by UCT Vice-Chancellor Professor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamokgethi_Phakeng&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mamokgethi Phakeng.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result is &lt;a href=&quot;https://oceanwomxn.co.za/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ocean Womxn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a program funded for an 5 year initial period, that aims to remove barriers and provide support for Black womxn in oceanography. In the first year, 5 womxn joined the program, with 2 more following in 2021. The Fellows receive comprehensive support – this includes financial cover for the duration of their degree, relocation costs, field gear budget and a laptop. They also have sea-going opportunities, such as SEAmester cruises, where they can develop lab skills and receive hands-on experience. Additionally, they are offered the option of swimming, boating and scuba lessons. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS ONE recently spoke with some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oceanwomxn.co.za/cohort-2020&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ocean Womxn Fellows&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about the program and how it has impacted their journey as early career oceanographers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Doctoral training programs and fellowships often provide valuable resources and opportunities for PhD candidates. What opportunities have you had as an Ocean Womxn Fellow that you might not have otherwise had as a general PhD student? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith:&lt;/strong&gt; I would definitely say the emotional and moral support by being in a cohort. Also, the mentor sessions with other women and role models in STEM fields. An added opportunity is definitely the exposure that we get on social media and all over for changing the landscape for black womxn in Oceanography. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kolisa:&lt;/strong&gt; My most memorable and unique opportunities that I am receiving through Ocean Womxn are networking with influential women in the world of STEM. Every month we have visiting mentors ranging from women Professors to women PhD candidates who are making waves in their industries and fields of expertise. This is unique to Ocean Womxn as no other fellowship does this in our department. From these face-to-face interactions we get to ask whatever questions we want answered by the invited mentor. This has largely enriched not just my thinking, but I have formed relationships with some of our guests and have been recommended for opportunities by some.&lt;em&gt;  &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Researchers from under-represented groups/communities often experience a “burden of service”, whereby they are asked to do more outreach and engagement activities than their colleagues. This can take time away from doing actual research. Have you ever previously experienced this, and how has the Ocean Womxn program helped you to avoid being in this situation? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith:&lt;/strong&gt; For me the outreach and engagement activities are not a “burden of service”, but rather an act of love and kindness to reach out to other under-represented groups. The support that I experienced through the Ocean Womxn program inspired me to support other young womxn in STEM research fields. I got involved in the Project Kuongoza Mentorship program as a mentor to mentees across Africa and am now “serving” my continent outside the borders of the country! I believe that you need to have a balance in life and sharing about your experiences in research should be seen as part of enriching your life. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kolisa: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes, I have experienced this. More so because I am a well-known science communicator and so in addition to having the responsibility of “burden of service” I have the responsibility to “teach” science to the masses. Ocean Womxn has enhanced this and for me it really is not a burden but a privilege. I see it as a privilege because I get to be an underrepresented group representative doing the service so well, encouraging others to follow in my footsteps and see that it is possible. It is key for me to be this type of scientist because I did not have this as I grew up in a world where I had no black women ocean scientists to look up to. Ocean Womxn has magnified my role as a role model in not just ocean sciences but in science at large. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; What is the most memorable fieldwork or laboratory experience you have had so far? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith:&lt;/strong&gt; I was involved in the First European-South African Transmission Experiment which was an international collaboration between Germany, Netherlands, Norway, and South Africa. It was a huge challenge and honour for me to be responsible for the data acquisition, analysis, storage, and maintenance of the aerosol equipment. It also led to me doing my PhD! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kolisa:&lt;/strong&gt; My most memorable fieldwork to date is being part of the Prince Edward Island sampling expedition for my PhD. On the expedition we sailed to the subantarctic Southern Ocean on the SA Agulhas II which is South Africa’s research vessel. I spent about 2 and half months in the middle of the ocean living though sea storms and calm waters. It was my first experience out that far into the open ocean. I returned to land as a new woman. I was transformed mentally and had this urge to change the world with my science and I believe that is exactly what I am currently doing. I wanted to make academia and science inclusive, especially for black women! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Your research focuses on understanding the impacts of climate change. How did you become interested in this field?  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith:&lt;/strong&gt; My research on atmospheric aerosols, and more specifically sea spray aerosols, seeks to address the uncertainty about the drivers of climate change. As sea spray aerosols occur naturally in the atmosphere, it can be used as a proxy for pre-industrial conditions and to determine how anthropogenic activities contributed to climate change. I am a Physicist and was involved in characterizing atmospheric effects over the ocean on visual and infrared cameras, when it became apparent that aerosols (microscopic particles) play a huge role in the atmosphere. I then decided to do my PhD atmospheric aerosols to improve the understanding and inputs of aerosols to prediction models of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kolisa: &lt;/strong&gt;Our planet is changing as we know it and our role as scientists is key in uncovering the shifts. As science majors we always heard, read about, and were constantly reminded of global warming which leads to climate change. This sparks interest in many of us to want to uncover and dissect the intricacies of how this happens, how it affects our planet and what we need to do to mitigate it. Therefore, my interests I can say were sparked long before I even knew I would take my research focuses this far into academia. I wanted to be one of the first and few black women scientists from Africa who are part of this global research to understand our planet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; More and more researchers are committing to the mission of Open Science: to making the entire research process openly accessible, transparent, and reproducible. Examples of this include publishing in open access journals, preregistering research plans, publishing protocols, as well as sharing data and code. What are your thoughts on Open Science and how do you feel this kind of improved transparency, accessibility and equity impacts scientific research? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith:&lt;/strong&gt; I am all for Open Science! It was such a relief when articles that were previously behind the paywall became available due to the pandemic. I think that scientific research will now reach higher heights and swifter turnarounds with more diverse collaborations. The Covid-19 vaccine rollouts is a sterling example of how the “openness” of scientific science can contribute to quicker implementations and finding solutions for all. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kolisa:&lt;/strong&gt; I personally have chosen the path of science communication to merge with my research because I support open science. Open science starts with transparency, inclusivity and being accommodative. When our science is openly accessible and well understood we achieve more with our discoveries. The aim of us doing science is to understand how systems work and report on those. These reports are in forms of difficult journal papers that take a lot to understand. I believe that we need to evolve with the times and make our science open and easily understandable by anyone who reads our findings and recommendations. How will the world improve, and people be educated if we do not articulate ourselves strategically to be open and transparent about our data, our research plans and our publishing and communication? &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having a new baby is never easy: it’s difficult to manage the stress of birth, sleepless nights, and juggling of childcare and domestic responsibilities, especially for first-time parents. Some also experience postnatal depression, which is estimated to affect 23% of women in Europe after the birth of a child (men also experience postnatal depression, though the numbers are not so clear).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add to new parenting the impact of lockdown, and that figure could rise sharply, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648002/full&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt; suggests. Working with women with babies aged six months or younger in the UK during the first COVID-19 lockdown, UCL’s Sarah Myers and Emily H. Emmott found that almost half met the threshold for postnatal depression — double the average European rates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42503&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were 162 London-based women aged between 19 and 47 years old; half were first-time mothers, while the other half had up to three other children. Women first filled in a survey which measured symptoms of postnatal depression, then shared their own personal social networks, listing up to 25 people and explaining who they were and what the relationship was.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After sharing this information, participants also reported who in this network they had seen in person and who they had chatted with on the phone, via video call, or by text or WhatsApp over the last few weeks. Contacts included family, old friends, colleagues and so-called “mummy friends” — non-family female friends who also had children of the same age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results showed high levels of depressive symptoms among the new mothers, with 47.5% reporting symptoms that met the threshold of diagnosis of postnatal depression (34.6% of the group reported particularly high levels of symptoms).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In terms of social networks, participants (like many non-parents) saw few people during the weeks leading up to the survey. On average, women had seen one family member, three other general friends, and no “mummy friends”, though they were speaking to many different social contacts via social media, phone call or text. Many women were going without support from family members, however — 47.5% had seen no relatives at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Social contact was also linked to depressive symptoms: the more social contacts participants saw in person, the less likely they were to report symptoms of postnatal depression, suggesting a link between social isolation and depression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also explored the experience of new parenthood during lockdown through open-ended questions about how the pandemic had affected mothers’ self-esteem and their relationships with their babies. Some mothers felt positively about lockdown, stating that it had given them more quality time with their baby and an increase in time partners were home and able to help with childcare. “It has been a great help having my partner home every day as it means most days I can get at least an hour to myself which I use to exercise or catch up on sleep,” one woman wrote. “Also I think it has been an amazing positive on my partner’s ability to build a bond with the baby and co-parent.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, in concordance with the high levels of depressive symptoms, other mothers struggled. Some felt a “constant burden” of parenting (“I think lockdown has made me feel like I’m not a person in my own right anymore, just a mum”), while others pointed to the relative inadequacy of online support. One woman pointed to the many video calls and chats she had during this period — but noted that the physical isolation of lockdown led to a lack of practical advice and support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, others saw lockdown as a time of “lost opportunities”. “You’re only a first time mum once, and I was really looking forward to this time and making new mum friends,” one woman wrote. “I think I am most sad about missing out on that.” Others pointed to worries about development — concerns about whether children would recognise family members having only met them on FaceTime, missing physical and mental milestones, and lack of play with other children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team points to two key insights: firstly, that it “takes a village” to raise a child, with social networks crucial to supporting both parents and babies in the time after birth; and secondly, that the impact of COVID-19 on new parents should be considered in healthcare interventions, with key focus on face-to-face, rather than digital, support from health and social care services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study highlights the unique (and incredibly stressful) circumstances into which new parents were thrust during the COVID-19 pandemic — and now that lockdown has eased, the results suggest, it may be an opportune time to reach out to new parents in your own social networks.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remote focusing is widely used in 3D two-photon microscopy and 3D photostimulation because it enables fast axial scanning without moving the objective lens or specimen. However, due to the design constraints of microscope optics, remote focus units are often located in non-telecentric positions in the optical path, leading to significant depth-dependent 3D field distortions in the imaging volume. To address this limitation, we characterized 3D field distortions arising from non-telecentric remote focusing and present a method for distortion precompensation. We demonstrate its applicability for a 3D two-photon microscope that uses an acousto-optic lens (AOL) for remote focusing and scanning. We show that the distortion precompensation method improves the pointing precision of the AOL microscope to &amp;lt; 0.5 µm throughout the 400 × 400 × 400 µm imaging volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory neurons orchestrate the activity of excitatory neurons and play key roles in circuit function. Although individual interneurons have been studied extensively, little is known about their properties at the population level. Using random-access 3D two-photon microscopy, we imaged local populations of cerebellar Golgi cells (GoCs), which deliver inhibition to granule cells. We show that population activity is organized into multiple modes during spontaneous behaviors. A slow, network-wide common modulation of GoC activity correlates with the level of whisking and locomotion, while faster (&amp;lt;1 s) differential population activity, arising from spatially mixed heterogeneous GoC responses, encodes more precise information. A biologically detailed GoC circuit model reproduced the common population mode and the dimensionality observed experimentally, but these properties disappeared when electrical coupling was removed. Our results establish that local GoC circuits exhibit multidimensional activity patterns that could be used for inhibition-mediated adaptive gain control and spatiotemporal patterning of downstream granule cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where were you at 8am two Tuesdays ago? If it’s a little tricky to recall, what if I presented you with a map with four location flags to choose from, each about 3-4 km apart, with one marking your actual location on that time and date?  Are you confident that you’d pick the right one?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; confident, the good news from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620980752&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; is that you’re more likely to be right than if you’re not too sure. The bad news is that when a group of students in Melbourne, Australia was tested in this way, they picked the wrong location 36% of the time. The study shows that this type of memory is pretty fallible — and yet it’s the type, of course, that’s needed for a criminal alibi. Failures in recalling where you were have no doubt contributed to serious miscarriages of justice, write Elizabeth Laliberte at the University of Melbourne and her colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42494&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 51 students all downloaded onto their phones an app that had been developed by two of the researchers. Over a four week period, this app continuously tracked their movement and orientation, and also took GPS location and audio snapshots every ten minutes. Software stripped any speech from these audio files, but preserved background noise, such as birdsong or building work. (The app was designed to keep raw participant data confidential from even the researchers, and the participants were able to pause data collection for periods.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After a week’s delay, the participants were tested, again via the app. For each of 72 trials, they had to pick where they were on a specific time and date from four markers on a Google map. (They were able to zoom in and out and pan as they pleased). One of these markers represented the correct location, and the other three represented places they’d been on other occasions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team’s analysis revealed that, as a group, the students were correct only about two-thirds of the time. Accuracy did increase with confidence, a finding that supports the idea that (under certain circumstances) &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/08/public-belief-in-memory-myths-not-actually-that-widespread-study-argues/&quot;&gt;greater confidence is linked to better memory&lt;/a&gt;. But the far from perfect performance of these university students, with presumably fairly regular schedules, doesn’t bode well for the rest of us — especially people without regular office hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team highlights the case of American man Ronald Cotton, who in 1985 was convicted on charges of rape and burglary and sentenced to life plus 50 years in prison. Ten years after the conviction, DNA evidence exonerated him. Cotton’s initial defence had not been helped when his alibi had been shown to be false. “Rather than report where he’d been at the time of the crime, Cotton mistakenly recalled where he had been the week before. The error probably contributed significantly to his wrongful conviction,” the researchers write.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team’s analysis suggests that this error is relatively common: choosing a “right-day, wrong-week” location accounted for 19% of their participants’ errors. Participants also frequently chose a location that matched the stipulated hour but got the day wrong — this error accounted for 8% of the mistakes. (They also sometimes picked an incorrect location in which they had made similar patterns of movement or where the background sounds were similar to the correct location — though these errors were less common). “Both of these figures are well above chance rates and suggest that the error that Ronald Cotton made might be quite common,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the findings could have practical, legal applications. Knowing just how fallible this type of alibi memory is — and understanding the most common errors that people make — could help lawyers to ask the right questions of defendants and witnesses, to try to get closer to the truth of where someone really was at a certain time.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there are more general implications for understanding memory, and for the way that memory research is done. Experiments are often lab-based, raising questions about real-world applicability. Passive, unobtrusive, privacy-conscious monitoring technologies like this new app could be used to gather and analyse all kinds of real-world data. As the researchers write, “We are now able to capture the ground truth of people’s lives and to test their ability to retain those events.” And this, they hope, could change how a good deal of memory research is done.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620980752&quot;&gt;The Fallacy of an Airtight Alibi: Understanding Human Memory for “Where” Using Experience Sampling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 A journal has retracted — and replaced — an article on “tribalism” in medicine and deleted a tweet about it, too, after readers complained that the language in the piece was offensive to Indigenous peoples.  The article, which appeared in the Journal of Hospital Medicine in April, was titled “Tribalism: The Good, The Bad, and … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/04/medical-journal-retracts-article-on-tribalism-after-readers-call-it-offensive/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Medical journal retracts article on “tribalism” after readers call it offensive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep researchers often takes a “brain-centric” approach to their work, measuring sleep stages using EEG, for instance, or examining how sleep affects learning and memory&lt;/strong&gt;. Yet rudimentary creatures also sleep — including the hydra, an aquatic organism which has a basic nervous system but no brain at all.  The findings suggest that our primitive ancestors slept before they even evolved brains, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/sleep-evolved-before-brains-hydras-are-living-proof/&quot;&gt;writes Veronique Greenwood&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42478&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In his recent testimony to a House of Commons committee, Dominic Cummings blamed “groupthink” for various failures by the government to adequately tackle the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/strong&gt;But at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/02/covid-mistakes-groupthink-government-dominic-cummings&quot;&gt;psychologists Stephen Reicher and John Drury explain&lt;/a&gt; that the concept of groupthink is “highly contested”, and doesn’t really reflect how groups actually make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When in our history did humans learn to count — and did our Neanderthal cousins also have a system for noting numerical information? &lt;/strong&gt;Colin Barras &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01429-6&quot;&gt;explores the possibilities&lt;/a&gt; in a fascinating feature at &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a recent paper, researchers report performing magic tricks for a very unusual audience: Eurasian jays. &lt;/strong&gt;The birds fell for just one of the three different sleight-of-hand tricks, while humans were tricked by all three. The jays’ apparent resistance to the tricks could reflect the fact they don’t have the same expectations as humans about hand movements, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/we-performed-magic-tricks-on-birds-to-see-how-they-perceive-the-world-161772&quot;&gt;writes researcher Elias Garcia-Pelegrin&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be wary of articles telling you how to “boost your dopamine levels” to achieve happiness. &lt;/strong&gt;The associations between our neurotransmitter levels and emotional states are much more complicated than those kinds of headlines suggest, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyche.co/ideas/the-fascinating-science-of-pleasure-goes-way-beyond-dopamine&quot;&gt;explains Dean Burnett&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Psyche&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who overestimate their media literacy skills are also more likely to view and share fake news. &lt;/strong&gt;The effects are fairly small, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/dunning-kruger-meets-fake-news/&quot;&gt;reports John Timmer at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but are consistent with other work on the Dunning-Kruger effect (and similar to another paper we covered in March, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/05/it-turns-out-you-can-bullshit-a-bullshitter-after-all/&quot;&gt;which found a “bullshit blindspot”&lt;/a&gt; among people who were overconfident in their own intellectual abilities).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Puppies have a natural capacity to understand human attempts at communication, according to a new study. &lt;/strong&gt;The team found that Golden Retrievers and Labradors were pretty good at responding to pointing and baby talk at just 8 weeks old, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2279726-puppies-are-born-with-the-genetic-ability-to-understand-humans/&quot;&gt;reports Christa Lesté-Lasserre&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;. These abilities seem to have a substantial genetic component, which makes sense given that humans have bred dogs to be social.&lt;/p&gt;

 Tips for making open access books

We look at six different ways that academic authors at Leiden University have found to make their books open access, and pass on their tips.

More and more academic books are published as Open Access (OA) making them freely available to read without any payment being necessary. The Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) already includes more than 42,000 peer-reviewed OA books from around 500 publishers worldwide. These books are integrated into most library catalogues. Research funders increasingly demand that output produced as a result of their funding, and which is published in books, should be published as OA. It is expected that in the future, more and more academics will publish their book OA as a lot of publishers are willing to publish books immediately OA.

In this blog post the Open Access Team from the Centre for Digital Scholarship, Leiden University Libraries, interviewed some Leiden academics about how they went about publishing their books OA. These interviews show what you can do to publish a book OA, and also how you can make a book that is already published accessible by open access. The examples are in no particular order.</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/PPI_Picscout_OAFI-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think of patients as naïve when seeking help and support, then you are seeing only one part of the picture. Increasingly in the past decade, patients are moving from being “users and choosers” to “makers and shapers”, thus challenging the classic caregiver paradigm. In the paternalistic model of medicine, health professionals appear like parents who impart the best treatment to patients without seeking their opinions in the process. However, owing to an increase in the literacy of patients and moral concerns of the patients’ “right to know”, progress is being made in recognizing the importance of patients’ values and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients live with their conditions every day and are the experts of them. This knowledge should be welcomed and valued throughout the process of care, as well as in the design and implementation of research studies by engaging patients in science. Patients with a scientific background, patients with chronic diseases that are experts of their condition, and those who have recovered from disease may be able to support others in dealing with their disease as well as researchers in the development and design of clinical studies. Knowing what patients want and how they want it is essential to improving the effectiveness of clinical research and consequent societal benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients live with their conditions every day and are the experts of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-12411&quot; height=&quot;553&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/shutterstock_600015697844.jpg&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What exactly is Patient and Public Involvement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Patient and public involvement (PPI) is essentially the research being carried out by researchers alongside members of the public rather than to, about, or for them. Patients have acquired decision-making power through the change of the medical and social paradigm and becoming more active at the time of seeking information around therapeutic options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent developments require investigators to involve the public as part of any prospective reseach and subsequently inform about study’s results. That is if they wish to successfully obtain research funding. Certain types of health research, such as participatory action studies with qualitative methods, mixed-methods studies, validation of questionnaires, Delphi studies, and development of clinical practice guidelines, actively encourage or necessitate patient involvement. On the other side, original research or literature reviews rarely involve patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the era of social media and enhanced connectivity, patients are coming together and patients’ organizations are becoming a reality. This can facilitate support and understanding or, importantly recognize the feelings of being a person suffering from a disease. Patients’ organizations recognize the willingness of patients with a severe chronic condition, such as osteoarthritis, to be involved in public health programs, clinical research, and trials. These partners continuously seek information to be up to date on everything related to their daily life struggles: the disease and its symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can publishers advance public engagement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What science is doing for me? Or How can I contribute with my insights? are two frequent questions in the mind of patients. Still, answering this can be complex as verifying scientific data and accessing the latest publications is challenging for most lay people. Science does not often speak a patient-friendly language, and partner organizations are working to bridge the gap between patients and the scientific community by being the translators between these two worlds. The publishing community has started to recognize its responsibility in delivering and facilitating access to its discoveries to patients and the general public. In this context, journals can play a key role in reducing scientific language barriers by allowing patients and the public to contribute and author publishable &lt;strong&gt;“Patients perspectives”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patient and public involvement (PPI) is essentially the research being carried out by researchers alongside members of the public rather than to, about, or for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several other strategies could be implemented in peer-review journals to welcome patients on board during the publication process and ensure patient-friendly access to information. Some examples could include inviting published authors &lt;strong&gt;to write a lay summary&lt;/strong&gt; of their work (in one or more languages), &lt;strong&gt;a patient information note&lt;/strong&gt;, and/or &lt;strong&gt;depict an infographic&lt;/strong&gt; to make it easily accessible to the general public. These can provide practical advice for patients based on the available evidence for the screening, assessment, and management of specific diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, submission guidelines could be implemented to help discern the studies complying with PPI guidelines, such as mandating &lt;strong&gt;the inclusion of the GRIPP-2 checklist&lt;/strong&gt;. This requirement would help to understand how the participation of patients would improve these studies’ results compared to those studies without their involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new normal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Innovations like creating and training&lt;strong&gt; a pool of engaged patient reviewers&lt;/strong&gt; to better understand their points of view and needs for submitted manuscripts which were hard to imagine a decade ago, could represent a revolution for the patients and the scientific community. Scientific articles presenting studies designed and conducted by patients to support patients are already a reality. In the last two years, the Osteoarthritis Patients Task Force which includes this blog’s author, a global alliance of patient organizations fighting against osteoarthritis, led by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oafifoundation.com/en/foundation/&quot;&gt;Osteoarthritis Foundation International (OAFI)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arthritis.org/&quot;&gt;Arthritis Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the results of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-019-2895-3&quot;&gt;a systematic review&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-020-03741-0&quot;&gt;a global survey&lt;/a&gt; analyzing patients with osteoarthritis’ perceptions of quality of life and associated factors. Both contribute in raising awareness of patients’ conditions and perspectives in a rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have entered an era of patient centricity, perspective, independence and auto-responsibility. There is still a long road ahead to go but we have already walked the first steps on it. If patients’ organizations and the editorial board of international journals join their efforts to give the perspectives of patients more visibility, then groundbreaking transformations can happen in health research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abstract for the talk is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large-scale numerical simulations of brain circuit models are important for identifying hypotheses on brain functions and testing their consistency and plausibility.
Similarly, spiking neural networks are also gaining traction in machine learning with the promise that neuromorphic hardware will eventually make them much more energy efficient than classical ANNs.
In this dev session, we will present the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt;-enhanced Neuronal Networks) framework [1], which aims to facilitate the use of graphics accelerators for computational models of large-scale spiking neuronal networks to address the challenge of efficient simulations.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; is an open source library that generates code to accelerate the execution of network simulations on &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NVIDIA&lt;/span&gt; GPUs through a flexible and extensible interface, which does not require in-depth technical knowledge from the users.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; was originally developed as a pure C++ and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/technologies/cuda/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUDA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; library but, subsequently, we have added a Python interface and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.khronos.org/opencl/&quot;&gt;OpenCL&lt;/a&gt; backend.
The Python interface has enabled us to develop a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/&quot;&gt;PyNN&lt;/a&gt; [2] frontend and we are also working on a Keras-inspired frontend for spike-based machine learning [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the session we will briefly cover the history and basic philosophy of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; and show some simple examples of how it is used and how it works inside.
We will then talk in more depth about its development with a focus on testing for &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt; dependent software and some of the further developments such as Brian2GeNN [4].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is an initiative to provide a ready to use Fedora based Free/Open source software platform for neuroscience.
We believe that similar to Free software, science should be free for all to use, share, modify, and study.
The use of Free software also aids reproducibility, data sharing, and collaboration in the research community.
By making the tools used in the scientific process easier to use, NeuroFedora aims to take a step to enable this ideal.
In this session, I will talk about the deliverables of the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; project and then go over the complete pipeline that we use to produce, test, and disseminate them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

It provides researchers with the means to express any kind of neural model in mathematical notation and takes care of translating these model descriptions into efficient executable code.
During this dev session I will first give a quick introduction to the simulator itself and its code generation mechanism.
I will then walk through Brian’s code structure, our automatic systems for tests and documentation, and demonstrate how we work on its development.
The Brian simulator welcome contributions on many levels, hopefully this dev session will give you an idea where to start.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;li&gt;Location (Zoom): (link no longer valid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abstract for the talk is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurolib-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;neurolib&lt;/a&gt; is a computational framework for whole-brain modelling written in Python.
It provides a set of neural mass models that represent the average activity of a brain region on a mesoscopic scale.
In a whole-brain network model, brain regions are connected with each other based on structural connectivity data, i.e. the connectome of the brain.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurolib-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;neurolib&lt;/a&gt; can load structural and functional data sets, set up a whole-brain model, manage its parameters, simulate it, and organize its outputs for later analysis.
The activity of each brain region can be converted into a simulated &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BOLD&lt;/span&gt; signal in order to calibrate the model to empirical data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
Extensive model analysis is possible using a parameter exploration module, which allows to characterize the model’s behaviour given a set of changing parameters.
An optimization module allows for fitting a model to multimodal empirical data using an evolutionary algorithm.
Besides its included functionality, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurolib-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;neurolib&lt;/a&gt; is designed to be extendable such that custom neural mass models can be implemented easily.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/e-cigarette-1301664_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the Tobacco Policy Review Group published &lt;em&gt;Tobacco Free Ireland&lt;/em&gt;, a report which set a target for Ireland to reduce smoking prevalence to less than 5% by 2025. The report identified tobacco-related harm reduction as a key issue for consideration. Since e-cigarettes’ launch in the European Union (EU) in 2006 and in the United States of America (USA) in 2007, research on their potential benefits in terms of tobacco-related harm reduction, and on the public health harms of e-cigarettes, has grown. The systematic evidence review reported in this piece outlines what is known to date about using e-cigarette and initiation of smoking tobacco cigarettes among teenagers. There are two sister reviews: the first maps the harms and benefits of e-cigarettes [McCarthy 2020] and the second presents a systematic review of e-cigarettes role in smoking cessation [Quigley 2020]. These reviews are one of the inputs to the Irish governments policy and clinical guidelines on e-cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-10935-1&quot;&gt;Our systematic review&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; found that e-cigarette use among teenagers in Europe and North America was associated with starting tobacco cigarette smoking. Based on nine primary studies’ adjusted odds ratios, our meta-analysis calculated a three to six times higher odds of starting tobacco cigarette smoking for teenagers who had ever used e-cigarettes at baseline. These findings identify an important health-related harm and are supported by four other systematic reviews. [Soneji 2017; Glasser 2019; Khouja 2019; Aladeokin and Haighton 2019] Three of these reviews were among young adults [Soneji 2017; Glasser 2019; Khouja 2019] and one was in teenagers living in the UK [Aladeokin and Haighton 2019]. These findings are important because the prevalence of e-cigarette use is increasing in Europe and North America. For example, the prevalence of e-cigarette use among teenagers in the USA increased from 1.5% in 2011 to 20.8% in 2018 [Cullen 2018] and in Ireland ever use is 22% [Költő 2020]. Additionally, there is a danger that society will not be able to protect achievements in declining tobacco cigarette initiation among teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study provides added support for urgent response by policymakers to stop their use by teenagers to decrease direct harms in this susceptible population group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the availability and usage of e-cigarettes, this study provides added support for urgent response by policymakers to stop their use by teenagers to decrease direct harms in this susceptible population group. The study presented in this paper was conducted as part of broader program of evidence reviews to inform and support public health policy in Ireland, which included mapping of the harms and benefits of e-cigarettes (and their e-liquids) [McCarthy 2020] and a systematic review of e-cigarettes role in smoking cessation [Quigley 2020]. We found that e-cigarettes (and their e-liquids) lead to acute harms such as poisoning, lung injury, and burns and blast injuries, a finding aligned with six other systematic reviews [Peruga 2020; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, Medicine2018, Pisinger 2014; CADTH 2017; Byrne 2018; Bals 2019] and highlighted a need for continuing study using robust methods to measure the long-term health impacts of their use as these are not yet known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children and adolescents require the same protection from e-cigarettes as conventional tobacco cigarettes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children and adolescents require the same protection from e-cigarettes as conventional tobacco cigarettes through a well-enforced regulatory regime of measures including age restriction on purchase, control of availability through licensing outlets, limits to product visibility and attractiveness, and appropriate pricing through taxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join us for a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; showcase at the 30th Annual meeting of the Organization for Computational Neuroscience (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnsorg.org&quot;&gt;OCNS&lt;/a&gt;) on July 3, 2021.
You can register for CNS*2021 &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2021&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The showcase will also be recorded for later viewing.
The description of the showcase is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Neuroscience is heavily dependent on the availability of Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) tools that support the modern scientific process.
While more and more tools are now being developed using FOSS driven methods to ensure free (free to use, study, modify, and share---and so also free of cost) access to all, the complexity of these domain specific tools makes their uptake by the multi-disciplinary neuroscience target audience non-trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NeuroFedora community initiative aims to make it easier for all to use neuroscience software tools.
Using the resources of the FOSS Fedora community, NeuroFedora volunteers identify, package, test, document, and disseminate neuroscience software for easy usage on the general purpose FOSS Fedora Linux Operating System (OS).
As a result, users can easily install a myriad of software tools in only two steps: install any flavour of the Fedora OS; install the required tools using the in-built package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make common computational neuroscience tools even more accessible, NeuroFedora now provides an OS image that is ready to download and use.
Users can obtain the CompNeuroFedora OS image  from the community website at &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://labs.fedoraproject.org/&quot;&gt;https://labs.fedoraproject.org/&lt;/a&gt; .
They can either install it, or run it “live” from the installation image.
The software showcase will introduce the audience to the NeuroFedora community initiative.
It will demonstrate the CompNeuroFedora installation image and the plethora of software tools for computational neuroscience that it includes.
It will also give the audience a quick overview of how the NeuroFedora community functions and how they may contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User documentation for NeuroFedora can be found at &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While some vegetarians yearn for meat (and occasionally give into temptation), others who eschew animal products find meat repulsive. Those who go veggie for moral reasons — as opposed to those who do it for their health — are &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1997.tb00685.x&quot;&gt;particularly likely&lt;/a&gt; to find meat disgusting, even if they previously enjoyed its taste.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666321002063?via%3Dihub#!&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; from a University of Exeter team, it isn’t just vegetarians who find the look of meat disgusting, either — sometimes, meat-eaters do too. And in a world where many of us are being encouraged to give up meat for the sake of the environment, the researchers suggest that harnessing this disgust could be a way of reducing intake when other techniques fail.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42446&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 711 participants in the study were a mix of people with different diets — 56% identified as omnivores, 28% as flexitarians (i.e. those who are sometimes vegetarian and sometimes omnivorous), and 15% vegetarians, some of whom were vegan and some pescatarian.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, an implicit association task (IAT) measured implicit attitudes towards meat. Participants were presented with a series of images of foods, which they had to classify as meat or carbs, and words like “foul” or “mouth-watering”, which they had to classify as “delicious” or “disgusting”. The participants sorted both images and words into categories using left and right keys on their keyboard: for example, on one side they might see “carbs OR disgusting” and on the other “meat OR delicious” (in other trials, “meat” was paired with “disgusting” instead). If you find meat delicious, then responding should be faster when “meat” and “delicious” share the same key, the logic goes (though the IAT itself has &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/05/psychologys-favourite-tool-for-measuring-implicit-bias-is-still-mired-in-controversy/&quot;&gt;faced controversy&lt;/a&gt;).    &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, the team looked at &lt;em&gt;explicit&lt;/em&gt; responses to meat. The same pictures of meat and carbs were used, with participants asked to rate the images on a scale from 0 to 100 according to taste, how likely they would be to eat the food, and feelings of disgust. Finally, the team measured self-control, how much meat participants ate, and how long they had followed their particular diet. A follow-up survey, six months later, repeated these measures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vegetarians exhibited the highest level of disgust in both the explicit and implicit tests, with flexitarians second highest above omnivores. Carbs, on the other hand, were liked equally across all groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vegetarians don’t like meat: it’s hardly breaking news. But what &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; interesting about the results was the relationship between meat disgust and intake in the other two groups. In both the omnivore and flexitarian sample those who felt higher explicit meat disgust also had lower meat intake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The follow-up study provided further evidence that disgust has a tangible impact on how people eat. Flexitarians who showed an increase in their levels of explicit disgust of meat over the six month period had also decreased their meat intake by the time of the second survey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Encouraging disgust of meat could, therefore, be a way of encouraging people to cut down on meat. The team points to previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.766&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; that suggests many omnivores simply repress feelings of disgust around eating sentient, emotional creatures: harnessing this knowledge and increasing disgust could be one way of persuading someone that life is better vegetarian. However, it may not be a foolproof strategy — at present, it’s not clear in which direction the effect is working. Is disgust causing people to cut down on meat, or is cutting down on meat increasing disgust? Further research could look more closely at the direction of cause-and-effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666321002063?via%3Dihub#!&quot;&gt;Meat disgust is negatively associated with meat intake – Evidence from a cross-sectional and longitudinal study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other papers by this group of researchers led by Professor Didier Raoult and/or his right-hand man Professor Eric Chabrière, also appear to contain problems, ranging from potentially duplicated images to ethical concerns. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this blog post I have gathered the papers by the Raoult and Chabrière group that have image concerns. This post is not an accusation of misconduct, but a compilation of the potential problems found in 22 different papers by this group.  I welcome the authors removing any concerns by providing the original figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Concerns about duplicated images&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A set of at least 22 papers from the AMU/IHUMI group appear to have problematic images, including unexpected similarities across or even within figure panels. All of these have been posted on Pubpeer, including nineteen that I found and posted there. As of today the authors have not replied to most of these PubPeer posts, nor have they corrected the errors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Category I duplications&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some papers, such as DOI: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8135188/&quot;&gt;10.1093/ajcp/101.3.318&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/FF00F9CF37B71EE26560B12659F1ED&quot;&gt;PubPeer&lt;/a&gt;] or &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17337224/&quot;&gt;10.1016/j.ijid.2006.10.005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/21381A2B9753BDC9DB7D2F1957088A&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/21381A2B9753BDC9DB7D2F1957088A&quot;&gt;PubPeer&lt;/a&gt;] appear to contain ‘simple’ duplications in figure panels. As explained in &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2019/11/23/scanning-for-duplications/&quot;&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I call these &lt;strong&gt;Category I duplications&lt;/strong&gt;, where the exact same photo is used to represent two different experiments. These kinds of simple duplications can often be honest errors, where something went wrong during the paper submission or manuscript handling. A cheerful “Oops, yes you are right, we made an error” would have been enough, and these duplicated panels could be easily addressed with a Corrigendum. Unfortunately, the authors have not replied to most of the PubPeer posts.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the authors initially replied on Pubpeer and Twitter that the two images did not look identical, but later admitted they looked ‘intriguingly similar’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Category II duplications&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two papers in this set contain &lt;strong&gt;Category II duplications&lt;/strong&gt;, where images overlap or might have been rotated, mirrored, etc. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DOI &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26598566/&quot;&gt;10.4269/ajtmh.15-0436&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/D2FBE34F49E965A8BE6730E531E9F1&quot;&gt;PubPeer&lt;/a&gt;] has been corrected after posting it on PubPeer. In this paper, three of the four panels shown in Figure 1 were showing the same specimen. The aspect ratio of these overlapping areas, marked below with blue and magenta boxes, was not always the same. It appears the images might have been stretched differently, which would be unexpected if the errors were unintentional. Yet, the journal accepted a new set of panels in the July 2020 correction. The authors wrote: “&lt;em&gt;These resulted from errors by a researcher that were missed by other authors. Specifically, a single image was inappropriately inserted to represent three different experiments.&lt;/em&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;

In 2006, the year this paper was published, Raoult was banned from publishing in ASM journals for 1 year, which might have something to do with this author name removal (source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6072/1033)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6072/1033)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Category III duplications&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At least 10 AMU/IHUM papers with image problems contain &lt;strong&gt;Category III duplications&lt;/strong&gt;, where figures appear to have been altered or to contain duplicated elements. These types of duplications are the most likely to be the result of an intention-to-mislead. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Category III duplications were found in these papers:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As a scientist, interacting with data allows you to gain new insight into the phenomena you’re studying. If you read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/30/us/2020-year-in-graphics.html&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://d3js.org/&quot;&gt;D3&lt;/a&gt; docs or you browse &lt;a href=&quot;https://distill.pub/&quot;&gt;distill&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see impressive browser-based visualizations – interactive storytelling that not only accurately represent data but bring your attention to surprising aspects of it. Making good visualizations of your work can increase the accessibility of your research to a wide audience. My favorite example here (already several years old) is the semantic map of the brain from James Gao, Alex Huth, Jack Gallant and crew – at the time, visualizing brain map data in the browser was unheard of, and here was a visualization of how semantics map to different brain areas, in the browser, no downloads necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7653&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7653&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-1.png?w=564&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-1.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-1.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;564,413&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-1-4/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-1.png?w=564&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Snapshot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gallantlab.org/brainviewer/Deniz2019/&quot;&gt;brain data visualization&lt;/a&gt; from James Gao, Jack Gallant, Alex Huth and crew. Built on three.js and tornado. You can make these kind of visualizations yourself with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gallantlab/pycortex&quot;&gt;pycortex library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coming from the Python world, most visualizations you’ll make on a day-to-day basis will be very different from these: static plots, because that’s what’s convenient to make in matplotlib. How can you go from the Python world of static plots to the wizardry of Javascript?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A big wall you’ll run into is that modern web development is big. Getting to proficiency is hard: it’s very easy to get discouraged and fall off the wagon before you get to build something interesting. What I’ve assembled here is a kind of roadmap so that you can start building interesting dynamic visualizations with the lowest barrier to entry as possible, while building a self-reinforcing skillset. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-table is-style-stripes&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Technology&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Application areas&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Pros&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Cons&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;What you learn&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Python-based generators&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dashboards, lightweight interactions&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Easy distribution, low barrier to entry&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Limited interactivity&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Grammar of interactive graphics&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Jupyter notebook&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Daily data exploration&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;You’re already using it!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Distribution not straightforward&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Snippets of HTML, JS, SVG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Walled garden&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;All-in-one visualizations (widgets)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Limited things to learn&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;What you learn is non-transferable&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The walled garden&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;JS notebooks&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Literate programs&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;REPL environment, good docs&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Learning curve a bit steep&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Core JS plus visualization libraries&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;The web&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Web dataviz&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;You control everything&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Floodgates of tech stack, learning curve quite steep&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Packaging, components, deployment&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, at the end of this article, I cover JS libraries you might want to learn to do for plotting or numeric work. I’ve built this from experience over the last year experimenting with about a half-dozen interactive visualization methods; of course, if you know better curricula, books or tutorials, please let me know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Step 0: Python-based libraries&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your first option is to not code for the web at all by leveraging pure Python-based libraries. Many libraries aim to fill a niche for everyday interactive graphics, which include minimal interactions – hover interactions, tooltips, interactive legends, etc. This includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://plotly.com/&quot;&gt;Plotly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://holoviews.org/user_guide/Dashboards.html&quot;&gt;Bokeh w/Holoviews&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/interactions.html&quot;&gt;Altair w/vegalite&lt;/a&gt;. On the mapping side, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet&quot;&gt;ipyleaflet&lt;/a&gt; is worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Dashboard tools&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7657&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7657&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-2&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;838,742&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-2-4/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png?w=300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/demo-uber-nyc-pickups/&quot;&gt;A demo visualization in streamlit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There has been an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/patrickmineault/status/1397574692135919617&quot;&gt;explosive growth in the past few years&lt;/a&gt;. These solutions fill the same niche as the ubiquitous Shiny fills in the R ecosystem: a way for data science teams to create dashboards. You can nevertheless use them for interactive scientific visualizations. Getting familiar with this kind of visualization will help you build a grammar of interactive visualizations and rapidly prototype more fully interactive visualizations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to expect: a Python script defines a visualization (plots, videos, images, maps, etc.) along with widgets, such as sliders and combo boxes. The whole thing gets served via a server which caches requests intelligently – changes in sliders trigger remote fetches which refresh the visualization. Some custom visualizations may be written in JS. Oftentimes, dashboard solutions are associated with a specific plotting library. so all the docs will be written in terms of that library – but generally you have some flexibility to use other frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One clarification: if you want to share your visualizations, you’ll need a server. All solutions have a basic open source offering allowing you to DIY deploy such a server yourself via e.g. a cloud provider. If that sounds messy, you can instead opt for a managed cloud solution – there’s often a free tier and paid tiers with more capabilities availables. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-table is-style-stripes&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Product&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Deployment&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Peculiarities&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Associated plotting library&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://panel.holoviz.org/&quot;&gt;Panel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DIY&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Works inside of jupyter and standalone&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Bokeh, with support other charting libraries&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://streamlit.io/&quot;&gt;Streamlit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DIY &amp;amp; commercial&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Very easy deploys&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Agnostic&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plotly.com/dash/&quot;&gt;Dash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DIY &amp;amp; commercial&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Supports lots of customization, aimed at enterprise users&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Plotly, with support for other libraries&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of these, Streamlit seems to have the most momentum according to Github stars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-6.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7716&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7716&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-6&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-6.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-6.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-6.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1454,896&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-6-3/&quot; height=&quot;412&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-6.png?w=1024&quot; width=&quot;681&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;See this article for &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/streamlit-vs-dash-vs-voil%C3%A0-vs-panel-battle-of-the-python-dashboarding-giants-177c40b9ea57&quot;&gt;a detailed breakdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: build for jupyter notebook&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the lowest friction way of doing dynamic HTML-based visualization in Python is in the jupyter notebook environment (or jupyter lab or colab). After all, you’re writing Python inside the browser &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;, why not use the same environment to whip up a quick interactive visualization? A big advantage of this type of solution is that it minimizes the contortions you have to go through to translate Python data types to javascript. And because you’re writing HTML, JS and Python side-by-side, your iteration cycles are very fast. The biggest problem is that most widgets you will create here will not display correctly when you publish them to the web, e.g. on GitHub: people will have to download the notebook to get the interactive effect. They will work inside of Binder, however. They are a great way to dip your toe into this world – at this point, you can probably get by by copying and pasting snippets of HTML, CSS, SVG and Javascript rather than formally learning them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;_repr_html_ and IPython.core.display&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Image&quot; height=&quot;126&quot; src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2sASUzXMAMrd68?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=large&quot; width=&quot;417&quot; /&gt;Basic demo of _repr_html_&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you print a variable at the end of a Jupyter cell, how does Jupyter know how to display it? The answer is that it looks for a &lt;code&gt;_repr_html_&lt;/code&gt; method for the associated class and calls it. This function can return any arbitrary snippet of HTML, including an iframe which does interactive things, or a snippet which embeds javascript. &lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eXwpjEzMMzu5EllJ3ljq_zEMVFAnifUR?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;See this colab for examples on how to do this&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mrocklin/status/1145265419638513669&quot;&gt;You can do fairly sophisticated things with this simple method&lt;/a&gt;, for instance building an interactive widget for pandas. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You may also trigger a rich display from anywhere inside a cell, not just at the end, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25698448/how-to-embed-html-into-ipython-output&quot;&gt;using the ipython API&lt;/a&gt;. Again, you can include any number of web technologies, including embedding scripts inside the embedded HTML.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code &quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;from IPython.core.display import display, HTML
display(HTML('&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Hello, world!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;'))
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;ipywidgets and interact&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ipywidgets&lt;/strong&gt;, also known as jupyter-widgets or simply widgets, are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Index.ipynb&quot;&gt;interactive HTML widgets&lt;/a&gt; for Jupyter notebooks and the IPython kernel. Notebooks come alive when interactive widgets are used. Users gain control of their data and can visualize changes in the data. Learning becomes an immersive, fun experience. Researchers can easily see how changing inputs to a model impact the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot;&gt;The ipywidget manual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next in line in complexity are &lt;code&gt;ipywidgets&lt;/code&gt;. Like &lt;code&gt;IPython.core.display&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ipywidgets&lt;/code&gt; can display rich HTML; however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20Events.html&quot;&gt;widgets can also have events which cause them to call Python&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eXwpjEzMMzu5EllJ3ljq_zEMVFAnifUR#scrollTo=aFiczwJ9h5v5&quot;&gt;See this notebook for an example&lt;/a&gt;. You can use them, for instance, to navigate through a plot with widgets. In fact, this pattern is so common that there’s a convenience function called &lt;code&gt;interact&lt;/code&gt; which allows you to do just slider-based interactions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;voila&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/voila-dashboards/voila/master/voila-bqplot.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila&quot;&gt;Voila example, from their docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building on jupyter widgets, you can release fully fledged dashboards based in jupyter notebooks. This is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila&quot;&gt;voila&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is that you write a regular jupyter notebook, and then you can serve it through a tornado server on the web. The end user sees a dashboard which is the concatenation of the output cells of the dashboard, without the code. You can deploy this on Heroku or Google App Engine to make your application world accessible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Walled gardens&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this point, you might feel stifled by the limited interactivity afforded by the solutions offered so far. And you might feel intimidated by full-fledged modern web development. Many products exist to fill the gap. However, I argue here that it’s better to bite the bullet and skip straight ahead to writing &lt;em&gt;real javascript&lt;/em&gt; in a notebook environment, because you will continue building on core skill sets around web technology. Nevertheless, I mention these options here for completeness and because they may satisfy your particular use case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Unity&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;A little Plinko sim&lt;img alt=&quot;🎄&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f384.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 1em;&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/unity3d?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#unity3d&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/geKwfhlpj6&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/geKwfhlpj6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Patrick Mineault (@patrickmineault) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/patrickmineault/status/1209900584473632770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 25, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unity.com/&quot;&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt; is a game development engine and IDE. It’s a great environment to build offline games and VR visualizations. It transpiles exported scenes and C#-based scripting to WebAssembly (WASM), so it also runs in the browser. C# is a modern language with operator overloading. 2d and 3d interaction are easily accommodated. Cons: widgets (sliders, input boxes, etc.) must be created in the Unity interface and are non-native. The Unity applet acts as a walled garden, making it &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-interactingwithbrowserscripting.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;difficult to interact with the native DOM&lt;/a&gt;. The C# code cannot be compiled with a command line tool – it must be combined with the project and compiled in the Unity editor, and the project is several GBs, hence can’t be tracked in Github. Furthermore, the math libraries in C# are pretty limited. Overall, a pretty limited option for the web, though it has considerable appeal if you’re doing 3d viz.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;p5.js and openprocessing&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress wp-embed-aspect-1-1 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OpenProcessing sketch, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openprocessing.org/sketch/853689&quot;&gt;Self-organized critical model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://p5js.org/&quot;&gt;p5.js&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openprocessing.org/&quot;&gt;openprocessing&lt;/a&gt; bring processing – a creative coding platform – to javascript. You write sketches, with an init function and a loop function, which define how the sketch works. You draw into the sketch with functions that allow you to draw lines, rectangles, sprites, polygons, etc. The appeal of processing is that you’re learning creative coding and there are very little barriers to entry. The biggest con is that while you learn a little bit of javascript in the environments, you really don’t learn modern web technologies. At the end of the day, you’ll know how to draw into your sketch, but you won’t know about canvas, svg, css, etc. – and you’ll be limited in the libraries that you can import into that environment. That being said, they can be part of your toolkit, especially p5.js which can interop with plain JS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Javascript notebooks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step in complexity is Javascript-based notebooks. Just as there are Python-based notebook environments that use remote kernels (jupyter, colab), there are local notebook-based environments that use Javascript that runs locally in the browser. That means you get the full power of the web – html, canvas, css, svg, javascript with remote libraries, etc. – but you’re doing it in an environment on wheels which supports the familiar REPL workflow of jupyter notebooks. These are environments which are ideal for literate programming which mixes text, math, code and visualization. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For many, I suspect this will be the right level of complexity. In practice, using notebooks mean you will need to export your data out of Python in order to visualize it – for many use cases, json will do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Observable&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7664&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7664&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-3&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=603&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;603,602&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-3-3/&quot; height=&quot;572&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=603&quot; width=&quot;573&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Text, code, equations, dynamic visualizations can all be mixed in observable. &lt;a href=&quot;https://observablehq.com/@xcorr/optimal-control-example&quot;&gt;Code here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://observablehq.com/&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/a&gt; is a notebook environment that runs in the browser, created by Mike Bostock, creator of d3. Observable is a little like jupyter notebooks, but it uses a kind of functional style where each cell may only have one output, and it resolves the DAG of dependencies to figure out which cells to recompute at what time, thus avoiding the pitfalls of ipython out-of-order execution issues.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://observablehq.com/tutorials&quot;&gt;It has an excellent set of starter tutorials&lt;/a&gt;. The observable runtime is open-source, but the notebook environment is closed-source. It continues to be feverishly developed – they just added multi-user collaboration. Strictly speaking, &lt;a href=&quot;https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observables-not-javascript&quot;&gt;it does not use Javascript&lt;/a&gt;, and it doesn’t make it very easy to export strict JS out of it – however, you can embed single cells on a webpage. Overall, a great place to get your REPL workflow going.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Starboard&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7671&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7671&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;coupled-oscillators&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=380&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;380,380&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/coupled-oscillators/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=380&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;An interactive visualization of coupled oscillators in Starboard, mixed Python and JS. &lt;a href=&quot;https://starboard.gg/pmin/desync-nKw0R7a&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://starboard.gg/&quot;&gt;Starboard&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source interactive notebook environment. It uses a different metaphor than Observable, sticking much closer to the Jupyter metaphor with its advantages and disadvantages. The biggest thing it has going for is that it supports both javascript and python via &lt;a href=&quot;https://pyodide.org/en/stable/&quot;&gt;Pyodide&lt;/a&gt;. What’s that you say? Python in the browser? Why yes, in fact:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pyodide brings the Python 3.8 runtime to the browser via WebAssembly, along with the Python scientific stack including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and scikit-learn. The packages directory lists over 75 packages which are currently available. In addition it’s possible to install pure Python wheels from PyPi. Pyodide provides transparent conversion of objects between Javascript and Python. When used inside a browser, Python has full access to the Web APIs.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Pyodide docs&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means you can keep some of the numerical computation in Python and mix and match JS and Python as necessary – though you’ll probably still want to use Javascript to manipulate the DOM. Pyodide was originally spun out by Mozilla from another (now defunct) notebook project called iodide, so starboard, along with a few others like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jtpio/jupyterlite&quot;&gt;jupyterlite&lt;/a&gt; are carrying the torch. I really like starboard – the editor feels great, it’s snappy, it has surprisingly little confusing magic going on. However, the documentation and examples are minimal, and it would benefit from a series of tutorials. I think observable is the more viable and mature option in this space for now but starboard is one to watch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: the web&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now you’ve had a chance to learn javascript, html, svg, enough css to do the job in the context of dynamic visualizations, and now you’re ready to tackle the world – the world wide web! It’s tempting at this point to learn modern web development, with its complex toolchains (npm + react + webpack + …) . I had an interesting conversation with Chris Olah recently who mentioned that when it comes to doing visualizations, the core skillsets – html, the dom, css, svg, etc. – are more important than learning any particular framework, and it helped organize this article. If you do need a component framework to work within a larger page, a more lightweight framework, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/&quot;&gt;Svelte&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;vue.js&lt;/a&gt;, might satisfy your needs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One very annoying gotcha you’ll run into is packaging differences between node and JS built for the web. A lot of packages you’ll use for data analysis in JS – like mathjs – were originally built for the node server environment. You need to build them to use them, which means learning about build tools, and pretty soon you’ve wasted a couple of days figuring out your transpiler. There are now cloud transpilers, in particular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skypack.dev/&quot;&gt;skypack&lt;/a&gt; and JSPM, that will compile node JS libraries for you so you can use them immediately without using a complex toolchain. That means you can import node packages in JS much in the same way you would import pip installable packages in Python:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;import * as mathjs from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/mathjs@8.0.1';
console.log(mathjs.add(1,2));&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Guido Zuidhof &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gzuidhof/starboard-notebook/issues/42&quot;&gt;for patiently explaining this to me&lt;/a&gt;. For deployment, provided you don’t rely on external services, you could use github pages, or use a CDN service like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/&quot;&gt;netlify&lt;/a&gt;. If you need to interact with data, then you may need to both create and deploy a data source via a REST API. Something lightweight like &lt;a href=&quot;https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/&quot;&gt;flask&lt;/a&gt; deployed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackabuse.com/deploying-a-flask-application-to-heroku&quot;&gt;heroku&lt;/a&gt; would do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;JS libraries&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you’re going through this process, it will often feel like the garden of forking paths: seemingly infinite decisions to make. However, there’s a small core set of JS libraries you might interact with:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;d3: data driven documents in JS, &lt;a href=&quot;https://d3js.org/&quot;&gt;https://d3js.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;mathjs: math, vectors, matrices in JS: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mathjs.org/&quot;&gt;https://mathjs.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;stdlib: a standard library for JS, including distributions: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib&quot;&gt;https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vega lite: declarative plots in JS: &lt;a href=&quot;https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/&quot;&gt;https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tensorflow.js: tensor computation library in the browser: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/js&quot;&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three.js: 3d visualizations for the web: &lt;a href=&quot;https://threejs.org/&quot;&gt;https://threejs.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arquero: like dplyr, for the web: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uwdata/arquero&quot;&gt;https://github.com/uwdata/arquero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think this is enough of a curriculum to carry you from 0 to 1 over a 6 month period. Practice, learn, and in no time you’ll be ready to make solid visualizations!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Further resources&lt;/h2&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">
 &lt;p&gt;arXiv’s members have provided approximately 25% of our operating budget for the past ten years, supporting arXiv’s mission to provide a reliable open platform for sharing research. By becoming arXiv members, more than 230 institutions around the world have made a strong statement in favor of open access, open science, and sustainable academic publishing. Thank you, members!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy to announce our &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/membership&quot;&gt;updated membership program&lt;/a&gt;, which was developed in collaboration with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/people/member_ad_board&quot;&gt;Membership Advisory Board&lt;/a&gt;. This program is part of our&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/05/26/arxiv-sustainability-model/&quot;&gt; sustainability model&lt;/a&gt;, complements arXiv’s diverse &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/funding&quot;&gt;funding sources, including societies and other organizations, &lt;/a&gt;and ensures that arXiv will have the funding required to continue meeting researchers’ evolving needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv membership is inclusive, flexible, and offers your institution a high value, low-risk, budget-conscious option to serve your scholarly community. Members receive public recognition, institutional usage statistics, eligibility to serve in arXiv’s governance, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universities, libraries, research institutes, and laboratories are invited to join or renew. For standard memberships, annual fees are based on submissions by institution, averaged over three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_institution_submissions&quot;&gt;find your institution’s overall submission rank here,&lt;/a&gt; as shown in the screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_1003&quot; style=&quot;width: 836px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot of interface to find submissions by institution&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1003 size-full&quot; height=&quot;377&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/Find-submissions-by-institution-1.png&quot; width=&quot;836&quot; /&gt;Hover your cursor over the area indicated by the purple arrow to reveal the search icon.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, match the overall rank to one of the contribution levels here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;If an institution ranks in the top 100 submitting institutions, their fee is $5000. Institutions ranked between 101 and 500 are charged $2500. Institutions ranked above 500 are charged $1000.&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-1004 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/Member-Levels-2021-05-26-at-11.08.59-AM.png&quot; width=&quot;409&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The top 100 institutions submitting articles to arXiv are invited to become members at the $5,000 level. The fee for institutions ranked between 101 and 500 is $2,500, and the fee for institutions ranked above 501 is $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Institutions that join or renew now will lock in their membership fee for 2022, 2023, and 2024. Institutions joining as part of a consortium will receive a 10% discount. Country-level consortia will receive a higher discount, depending on the level of participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In the example below, the university’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_institution_submissions&quot;&gt;overall submission rank&lt;/a&gt; is 182, which corresponds to the $2500 standard membership fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_1008&quot; style=&quot;width: 746px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Example submission data&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1008 size-full&quot; height=&quot;149&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/Submissions-example.png&quot; width=&quot;746&quot; /&gt;The overall rank, which is the three year submission average, is indicated by the purple arrow.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two flexible alternatives&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your institution is a champion of open access and has the budget to support a higher contribution, we offer the &lt;strong&gt;Champion&lt;/strong&gt; membership at $10,000 and above. Other institutions use arXiv &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_institution_downloads_by_year&quot;&gt;primarily for reading&lt;/a&gt; or face significant budget limitations. For these institutions, &lt;strong&gt;Community&lt;/strong&gt; membership is our most inclusive option, at an amount between $250 and $1000. All members receive the same benefits and are eligible to serve in arXiv’s governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join or renew today&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready to commit to open access, open science, and sustainable academic publishing? &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/membership_confirm&quot;&gt;Join, renew, or confirm your membership here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you represent a nonprofit or a company? &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/support_confirm&quot;&gt;Confirm your support here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In collaboration with the Membership Advisory Board and arXiv’s leadership team, we’re pleased to announce &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/funding&quot;&gt;arXiv’s updated sustainability model&lt;/a&gt;. This model, which is an expansion of the existing membership program, complements funding received from Cornell University, the Simons Foundation, and individual donors — and ensures that arXiv thrives for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nearly ten years, members have supported arXiv with funding and expertise — and for that we are grateful! As arXiv has grown, the number of organizations we interact with has expanded greatly, reflecting arXiv’s interdisciplinary nature. To welcome this wonderful diversity and encourage the entire arXiv community to contribute to arXiv’s financial future, we’ve expanded our sustainability model to include three programs for specific types of supporters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Members &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our membership program will remain central to arXiv’s sustainability. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/ourmembers&quot;&gt;Universities, libraries, laboratories, and research institutes&lt;/a&gt; across the globe are invited to become members (or renew their existing memberships) and represent the scholars who use arXiv to read and share research. Members support arXiv with essential funding and scholarly communications expertise, and members are also eligible to serve in arXiv’s governance. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/06/02/membership-program-submissions/&quot;&gt;Learn more about updates to the membership program here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Affiliates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/supporters&quot;&gt;Professional societies, government agencies, and other nonprofits &lt;/a&gt;collaborate with arXiv in a variety of ways, ranging from facilitating conference proceeding submissions to promoting open access compliance. Suggested contribution levels range from $5,000 to $100,000, or the in-kind equivalent. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/support_confirm&quot;&gt;Become an affiliate or renew your support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sponsors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/supporters&quot;&gt;Companies&lt;/a&gt; that benefit from arXiv’s services are encouraged to support the infrastructure with funding and in-kind donations such as developer time and cloud services. Suggested contribution levels range from $10,000 to $200,000, or the in-kind equivalent. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/support_confirm&quot;&gt;Become a sponsor or renew your support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited to grow our base of supporters, remain transparent about our funding sources, ensure that the cost to operate arXiv is distributed fairly across the community, and continue to meet researchers’ evolving needs. Specifically, our priority is to provide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continuous level of service for supporting exponential growth in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions&quot;&gt;submissions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_downloads&quot;&gt;downloads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seamless interoperability with other platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increased completeness and quality of metadata records, including support for affiliation and funding information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modernization of backend services and technological infrastructure for improved stability, performance and innovation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already support arXiv, thank you! If not, we encourage you to consider how you or your organization can get involved. You’re invited to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:membership@arxiv.org&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; to start the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Loneliness can be something of a vicious cycle. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/07/21/your-personality-can-invite-loneliness-and-loneliness-can-shape-your-personality/&quot;&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested, your personality can increase your likelihood of being lonely, and loneliness can impact your personality. We also know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/10/25/ten-year-study-finds-loneliness-and-self-centeredness-appear-to-be-mutually-reinforcing/&quot;&gt;self-centredness&lt;/a&gt; can increase loneliness, that being &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/11/16/being-true-to-yourself-may-protect-against-the-harmful-effects-of-loneliness/&quot;&gt;true to yourself&lt;/a&gt; can reduce loneliness, and that even &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/27/cold-days-can-make-us-long-for-social-contact-but-warming-up-our-bodies-eliminates-this-desire/&quot;&gt;warming yourself up on a cold day&lt;/a&gt; can ease cravings for social contact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Loneliness, then, is highly dependent on personality factors as well as social factors such as discrimination, limited access to transport, and lack of social cohesion. And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211007228&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, identifies another individual factor: low self-control. According to Olga Stavrova and team from Tilburg University in the Netherlands, failures of self-control can have serious social ramifications — leading to ostracism and, eventually, loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42440&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first study used data from 2,710 participants taking part in a longitudinal survey in the Netherlands. The team looked specifically at one time point in the study, where participants had answered questions on self-control, indicating how much they agreed with statements like “I am good at resisting temptation”, and loneliness, responding to statements such as “I have a sense of emptiness around me”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined participants’ Big Five personality traits, as well as demographic variables that have been previously associated with loneliness — gender, age, whether or not the participant lived alone or with partners or children, education, employment status, and income.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results showed that lower self-control predicts higher loneliness, an effect similar in size to that of some other predictors of loneliness such as low levels of extraversion and agreeableness (however, low emotional stability was a much stronger predictor than low self-control).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second study looked at day-to-day feelings of loneliness. Participants took part in a daily diary exercise, writing every day for a week about how lonely they had felt, and how often they had given in to a temptation. They also completed a measure of “trait” levels of self-control to measure base levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again, those with lower trait self-control were more likely to experience loneliness. Furthermore, those who reported failures in self-control on one day were also more likely to report loneliness in their diary on the subsequent day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why might lower self-control lead to loneliness? The researchers wondered whether low self-control signals that someone is not trustworthy, and so makes them more likely to be ostracised by others. So in another study, they asked participants to read a short paragraph about Robin, a (fabricated) previous participant who was having problems saving money but who nonetheless had ended up in an expensive electronics shop. In the low self-control condition, participants read that Robin had bought himself a new smartphone — even though he didn’t need one — while the high self-control condition heard that Robin had resisted temptation and left the shop empty-handed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They were then asked to imagine that Robin was a new co-worker and to indicate how likely they were to exclude him, and whether they thought he was likely to care for or take time for others, or engage in behaviours that could hurt others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consistent with their predictions, the team found that participants in the low self-control condition were more likely to ostracise Robin, which could partly be explained by the fact that they also perceived him as less prosocial and more likely to engage in selfish, potentially harmful behaviour. A final study found that participants with low self-control themselves reported experiencing greater experience of ostracism and more loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, overall, the results suggest that low self-control can increase loneliness — and that this increase occurs partly via social ostracism due to selfish impulses or potentially harmful behaviour. This makes sense — you may be more likely to be faithful to a partner or co-operate at work or in a game if you have higher self-control, which could make you seem more desirable as a friend, partner, or social contact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are other explanations, however. Those with low self-control may be ostracising &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt; — if you feel guilty or ashamed after a lapse in self-control, you might want to isolate yourself to deal with those feelings rather than being specifically excluded by others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future work could look at different kinds of self-control failure. If you fail to keep to a diet, for example, it only affects you — so would that lead to the same kind of ostracism that someone who can’t stop cheating on their partner might face? The team suggests that loneliness is more (or only) likely to occur when our actions have social repercussions; a closer look at this dynamic may shed more light on the relationship between ostracism, self-control and our social lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211007228&quot;&gt;Low Self-Control: A Hidden Cause of Loneliness?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Minghua Zheng will talk about a paper &quot;Class-Balanced Loss Based on Effective Number of Samples&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rapid increase of large-scale, real-world datasets, it
becomes critical to address the problem of longtailed data
distribution (i.e., a few classes account for most of the data, while
most classes are under-represented). Existing solutions typically
adopt class re-balancing strategies such as re-sampling and re-
weighting based on the number of observations for each class. In this
work, we argue that as the number of samples increases, the additional
benefit of a newly added data point will diminish. We introduce a
novel theoretical framework to measure data overlap by associating
with each sample a small neighboring region rather than a single
point. The effective number of samples is defined as the volume of
samples and can be calculated by a simple formula
(1-β^n)/(1-β), where n is the number of samples and β
∈ [0, 1) is a hyperparameter. We design a re-weighting scheme that
uses the effective number of samples for each class to re-balance the
loss, thereby yielding a class-balanced loss. Comprehensive
experiments are conducted on artificially induced long-tailed CIFAR
datasets and large-scale datasets including ImageNet and iNaturalist.
Our results show that when trained with the proposed class-balanced
loss, the network is able to achieve significant performance gains on
long-tailed datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

Incorporating a concept from deep learning, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(21)00064-7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Erik Hoel (2021)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“...outlines the idea that the brains of animals are constantly in danger of &lt;i&gt;overfitting&lt;/i&gt;,  which is the lack of generalizability that occurs in a deep neural  network when its learning is based too much on one particular dataset,  and that dreams help mitigate this ubiquitous issue. This is the  overfitted brian &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;[sic]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; hypothesis.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Overfitted Brain Hypothesis (OHB) proposes that the bizarre phenomenology of dreams is critical to their functional role. This view differs from most other neuroscientific theories, which treat dream content as epiphenomenal — a byproduct of brain activity involved in memory consolidation, replay, forgetting, synaptic pruning, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Hoel suggests that “it is the very strangeness of dreams in their divergence from waking experience that gives them their biological function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hallucinogenic, category-breaking, and fabulist quality of dreams means they are extremely different from the “training set” of the animal (i.e., their daily experiences). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up: the OBH conceptualizes dreams as a form of purposefully corrupted input, likely derived from noise injected into the hierarchical structure of the brain, causing feedback to generate warped or “corrupted” sensory input. The overall evolved purpose of this stochastic activity is to prevent overfitting. This overfitting may be within a particular module or task such a specific brain region or network, and may also involve generalization to out-of-distribution (unseen) novel stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of overfitting, I was reminded of Google's foray into &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html&quot;&gt;artificial neural networks&lt;/a&gt; for image classification, which was all the rage in July 2015.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electric fish seem to have mastered the art of the pause&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/05/electric-fish-pause/618993/&quot;&gt;writes Katherine J. Wu&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Brienomyrus brachyistius &lt;/em&gt;communicate by producing a series of electrical pulses. But researchers have found that the fish sometimes pause during their “conversations”, apparently as a signal that what they are about to communicate is important — similar to a “dramatic pause” in human speech.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42344&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As we covered &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/13/episode-24-how-children-learn-through-play/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in a recent podcast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, play is a vital part of children’s development. But how do the toys we choose to give kids shape their interests and skills?&lt;/strong&gt; At&lt;em&gt; BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210524-the-gender-biases-that-shape-our-brains&quot;&gt;Melissa Hogenboom explores&lt;/a&gt; how gendered toys can reinforce existing stereotypes and biases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have allowed a bind man to see again after 40 years, through the use of light-sensitive proteins injected into cells in the eye. &lt;/strong&gt;With the help of specialised goggles, the man was able to make out high-contrast images, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01421-0&quot;&gt;reports Sara Reardon&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. The study represents the first clinical use of optogenetics, a technique often used in basic neuroscience research. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;..and in other optogenetics news, researchers have used the technique to manipulate social behaviours in mice. &lt;/strong&gt;After inducing synchronous patterns of activity in the medial prefrontal cortex of two mice, the team found that the animals became more social, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/25/science/optogenetics-brain-social-behavior.html&quot;&gt;reports Virginia Hughes&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. The work has interesting parallels with that on “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/03/parents-have-more-synchronised-patterns-of-brain-activity-when-theyre-together/&quot;&gt;interbrain synchrony” in humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depending on the kinds of questions researchers ask, human memory can be seen as quite extraordinary — or really bad. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/our-memory-is-even-better-than-experts-thought/&quot;&gt;Nicole C. Rust examines&lt;/a&gt; the two perspectives at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychologists surely know enough about the replication crisis now to avoid uncritically citing work known to have issues… right? &lt;/strong&gt;Not according to a recent study, which looked at how often researchers cite work that has failed to replicate, compared to more robust findings. The team found that studies with replication issues were cited 153 times more often than those without, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/05/for-research-citations-no-replication-is-no-problem/&quot;&gt;reports John Timmer&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica &lt;/em&gt;— and those citations rarely mentioned the fact that the original paper had not replicated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, why do we often denigrate — or even punish — those who perform acts of altruism?&lt;/strong&gt; At The Observer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/may/23/why-are-we-so-uncharitable-to-those-doing-good-deeds&quot;&gt;Nichola Raihani&lt;/a&gt; explores why there is truth to the phrase “no good deed goes unpunished”.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Where is the spinothalamic tract?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The spinothalamic tract is a collection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; that carries information to the brain about pain, temperature, itch, and general or light touch sensations. The pathway starts with sensory neurons that synapse in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/dorsal-horn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dorsal horn of the spinal cord&lt;/a&gt;. Next, neurons extend from the dorsal horn and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/decussation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;decussate&lt;/a&gt;, or cross over to the other side of the spinal cord, before traveling up the spinal cord, through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/brainstem&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brainstem&lt;/a&gt;, and to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thalamus&lt;/a&gt;. These neurons synapse with neurons in the thalamus, which then carry the information to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/somatosensory-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;somatosensory cortex&lt;/a&gt;. See below for more details on the pathway of the spinothalamic tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-rte-preserve-empty=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the spinothalamic tract and what does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The spinothalamic tract actually consists of two pathways that are distinct in function: the anterior spinothalamic tract and the lateral spinothalamic tract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lateral spinothalamic tract&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;
      

    
  


  


&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The lateral spinothalamic tract is the main pathway for carrying information about pain and temperature from the body to the brain. It is also thought to carry information about itch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sensations that are carried by the lateral spinothalamic tract begin with receptors such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/nociceptor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nociceptors&lt;/a&gt;, which detect painful sensations, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thermoreceptor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thermoreceptors&lt;/a&gt;, which detect changes in temperature. These receptors pass a signal to the initial neurons of the spinothalamic tract, which transmit the signal to the spinal cord. Here, the neurons briefly either ascend or descend as part of a tract called Lissauer’s tract before synapsing on neurons in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/dorsal-horn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dorsal horn of the spinal cord&lt;/a&gt; that belong to cell groups like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/nucleus-proprius&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nucleus proprius&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/substantia-gelatinosa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;substantia gelatinosa&lt;/a&gt;; the latter is an important area for the modulation of pain signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The secondary neurons in the lateral spinothalamic tract cross over to the other side of the spinal cord and then ascend in the spinal cord, through the brainstem, and to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/ventral-posterolateral-nucleus-vpl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ventral posterolateral (VPL) nucleus&lt;/a&gt; in the thalamus. Because this pathway travels in the anterolateral portion of the spinal cord and brainstem, it is often referred to as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/anterolateral-system&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;anterolateral system&lt;/a&gt;. In the thalamus, spinothalamic neurons synapse on cells that will carry the sensory information to the primary somatosensory cortex, which is the main processing area for sensations from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Anterior spinothalamic tract&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The anterior spinothalamic tract (aka ventral spinothalamic tract) carries general touch or light touch sensations from the body. This includes touch sensations that don’t involve pressure, such as the stroking of hair or air lightly blowing on the skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;These sensations begin with sensory receptors in the skin, which pass a signal onto neurons that travel to the spinal cord. In the spinal cord, these neurons give rise to ascending and descending branches that synapse on neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Secondary neurons arise from the nucleus proprius in the dorsal horn, cross over to the other side of the spinal cord, and ascend to the thalamus near the lateral spinothalamic tract. From there, the information is carried on to the somatosensory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Damage to the spinothalamic tract&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A spinal cord injury that involves the spinothalamic tract can lead to distinctive sensory deficits. Because neurons in the tract cross over to the other side of the spinal cord before traveling up to the brain, they are carrying information from the opposite side of the body. Thus, if there is damage to one side of the spinal cord, it can cause a loss of pain, temperature, and light touch sensations on the side of the body opposite from where the damage occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;References:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Augustine JR.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pain is not a purely biological phenomenon: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953618301163?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;discrimination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/189004382.pdf&quot;&gt;anxiety around work&lt;/a&gt;, and general &lt;a href=&quot;https://oem.bmj.com/content/74/7/468.short&quot;&gt;mental strain&lt;/a&gt; have all been shown to contribute to the experience of chronic pain. Many researchers therefore take a biopsychosocial approach, exploring the multifarious factors that impact &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; and are impacted &lt;em&gt;by &lt;/em&gt;pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smi.3038?saml_referrer&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Stress &amp;amp; Health&lt;/em&gt; explores the long term consequences of social factors on pain. The team, from the universities of Georgia and South California, Los Angeles, specifically focus on families involved in the 1980s “farm crisis” in the US Midwest, a period where many lost their jobs, land value crashed, and businesses failed — and finds that this financial stress is related to the experience of pain nearly 30 years later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42323&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data was taken from a longitudinal study, which took place over 27 years and involved 508 married couples, who were all in early midlife at the start of the study in 1991.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team tracked a number of measures for the study. A four-item scale measured family financial strain in 1991, 1994 and 2001, and participants also answered items related to financial stress (e.g. “we have enough money to afford the kind of clothing we need”) at the same points. Sense of control was measured ten years apart, in 1991 and 2001, with participants indicating how much they agreed with statements such as “sometimes I feel that I am being pushed around in life”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pain was assessed at two points later on in the study, with participants indicating how much pain they had experienced in the previous month, how severe that pain was, and how much it interfered with life and work. Participants were also presented with a list of nearly 50 physical health conditions and asked to indicate which they had experienced in the last year; these ranged from common colds to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found a correlation between family financial strain and a sense of control at all points — that is, those who experienced financial strain also felt a lack of control over their lives. Financial strain and a feeling of a lack of control at early points of the study were also directly linked to physical pain at later points, indicating that physical pain can be a consequence of stress not just concurrently but many years later. Those with higher family income were less likely to experience physical pain overall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;trajectories&lt;/em&gt; of financial stress over the course of the study were also relevant to the experience of pain. Those who experienced increasing levels of financial strain over the years of the study also experienced a corresponding decline in their sense of control throughout the same period. This was the case even when controlling for other factors, such as age and physical illness, and was also linked to pain at the later points of the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what is actually driving the link between loss of control and physical pain, however. The team has numerous suggestions: for instance, feeling out of control could lead people to make bad decisions that in turn lead to pain or physical ill health. Chronic stress can also cause long-lasting changes in brain circuits involved in our stress response, so neurological processes could also be involved in producing experiences of pain many years after stress was experienced. Future research could explore these possibilities, as well as other drivers of loss of control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are limitations to the findings though. For instance, those with higher family income may have been able to afford better healthcare and make healthier lifestyle choices when it came to diet, exercise, and non-gruelling work practices, which could in turn have made them less likely to experience pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the study does suggest that there is a direct link between loss of control and negative physical and emotional factors. Interventions that increase people’s sense of control may not ameliorate those structural or social factors that cannot be changed, like a poor economy or unemployment, but could go some way to mitigating their physical and emotional impacts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smi.3038&quot;&gt;Midlife family financial strain, sense of control and pain in later years: An investigation of rural husbands and wives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We could all name groups of people who we know to be suffering right now; some in distant countries, some in our own. Research shows that we feel less empathy for people in other countries — and so are less likely to support them by protesting, say, or donating money. Meital Balmas and Eran Halperin at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem now report a factor that can influence this, however: our feelings about the national leader. The pair’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167220987989&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt; suggests that a leader who is perceived as “good” and popular at home elicits more empathy, and even greater tangible help, for their struggling citizens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42281&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across four experiments, participants read fictitious reports about purported leaders in Belgium.  These articles painted the leaders in either a positive or a negative light, focusing on their trustworthiness and warmth (or lack of it), for example. The participants also read about the suffering of Belgian citizens in the wake of a terrorist attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initial studies on Israeli citizens found that when the “prime minister” was described in glowing, rather than negative, terms, participants reported feeling more empathy towards Belgian people, and reported being more willing to help families in distress. A subsequent study found that the perceived popularity of the prime minister was important, however: a PM described as being good and popular boosted empathy, while an unpopular one did not — even if they were described as being good. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team then ran a version of this last study with 304 American adults. The methods were similar, but instead of reading about a terrorist attack, this time participants read about a Belgian teenager who was struggling to cope with the ravages and cost of treatment of his rickets. Repeating the earlier findings, when the country’s prime minister was presented as being popular, the participants exposed to the positive description reported more empathy for the teen and his family than those who’d read the negative report. They also said that they’d be more likely to sign a petition appealing to the Belgian government to help. And, when asked if they’d donate some of their fee for taking part in the study to the teenager and his family, they were more likely to agree.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What should we make of all these findings? “We know that national leaders provide rationale for opinion-building regarding their respective nations and contribute to the stereotyping of their citizens,” the researchers write. And they think this is what explains the results — when we think that a national leader who is a good person is popular, we tend to think that the nation’s people are likely to be good people, too, and we feel more empathy for their distress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The work should have implications for leaders, the researchers think. “In recent decades, not only have national leaders served as main foci of the media coverage of international affairs but nowadays they have followers from all over the world via Twitter,” they write. This puts a “huge responsibility” on their shoulders, they add. “The results of this study show that national leaders are in a position to contribute to better and more empathetic inter-society relations and raise pro-social behaviour around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is an interesting idea. Would people in other countries have felt as much sympathy for the people of Christchurch in the wake of the 2019 shootings, say, if New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern hadn’t seemed like such a good person — and also a popular prime minister? What if she’d more like — well, who? Insert your own least-liked democratically elected leader in that space…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting, though, that of course the country used in this study  —  Belgium — is an open democracy. It might seem reasonable to infer that people who love and elect a “good” person are more likely to be “good” people, too. Unfortunately, of course, a huge amount of human suffering is happening in countries without a democratically elected leader. How that affects our empathy for those citizens is an important question that’s beyond the scope of this study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167220987989&quot;&gt;I Care About Your Plight, But Only If I Like Your Leader: The Effect of National Leaders’ Perceived Personality on Empathy and Pro-Social Behavior Towards Their Citizenry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Aamir Khan will talk about a paper &quot;Study of weak / strong multiplication in gain modulation&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an extension of my previous work on the multiplicative response of
spiking neural networks. In our artificial life platform I evolve a gain
modulated network where there are two Inputs namely d (driving input) and m (
the modulatory input). The network aims for a multiplicative Sigmoidal/gaussian
response modulated by the modulatory input m. The response of the network
exhibits three properties such as 1. Saturation , 2. Non linearity and
3.Multiplicity. The multiplicative capacity of the network varies from strong
to weak in a manner that for some modulatory input there is strong
multiplication and for some there is a weak multiplication, I have
differentiated the response of the network in weak/ strong response. Along with
the classification some further constraints are introduced in the system like
The size of the network tends to be larger i.e 5 nodes, in order to reduce the
size I reward the response of the one interneuron and treat it as the output
node.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, psychologists and neuroscientists have conducted a large number of studies into the effects of psychedelic drugs. Some have sought to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/16/neural-changes-after-taking-psychedelic-drugs-may-reflect-heightened-consciousness/&quot;&gt;better&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/10/psilocybin-alters-brain-levels-of-the-neurotransmitter-glutamate-and-this-could-explain-why-users-experience-ego-dissolution/&quot;&gt;understand&lt;/a&gt; the effects of the drugs in the brain, while others are investigating the potential for substances like psilocybin and LSD &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00187-9&quot;&gt;to treat depression&lt;/a&gt; and other mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This work obviously require tactful communication on the part of researchers: after all, they don’t want to alienate a public who may be at best ambivalent about the use of currently illegal drugs in research or mental health settings. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963662520981728&quot;&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Public Understanding of Science &lt;/em&gt;highlights one thing researchers &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; do: admit to using psychedelic substances themselves. The team finds that researchers who make such a disclosure may be seen by the public as having less integrity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42252&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, Matthias Forstmann at the University of Zurich and Christina Sagioglou at the University of Innsbruck asked 185 participants to read a vignette about a (fictitious) scientist who studies the use of psychedelics to treat mental health disorders, and who has found some promising results regarding the use of psilocybin. Half read that the professor has “extensive personal experience” with the drugs himself, while the others read that he has no such experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All participants then assessed the professor’s scientific integrity, by rating how well he was described by six adjectives such as “professional” and “credible”. They also evaluated the quality of his research, rating it on adjectives like “valid” and “meaningful”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants who had read that the researcher took the drugs himself rated his integrity significantly lower than those who had read he didn’t use them (this was true regardless of whether the participants themselves had experience taking psychedelics). However, this information didn’t influence people’s judgements about the quality of his research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second study replicated the first, with a greater number of participants and more elaborate descriptions of the professor (for instance, participants saw a mock-up of a paper he had supposedly written). Participants were also asked about the &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; of the findings: whether healthcare providers should cover the costs of using psilocybin, for example. Again, those who read that the professor took psychedelics rated his integrity lower, but the two groups didn’t show any difference in their ratings of the quality or value of the work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are a few possible explanations for these results, the team notes. A researcher who studies psychedelics but also uses them might be seen as having a hidden agenda, for instance. Or perhaps it is the illegal nature of his drug use that makes it seem as though the researcher has less integrity. Further work will be needed to tease out these possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s worth pointing out that the difference in integrity ratings wasn’t huge: in the first study, the non-drug-using professor received an average rating of 5.6 on a seven-point scale, compared to a rating of 5 for the researcher who took drugs. Still, the message of the study seems to be that researchers should consider keeping quiet about any drug use in their personal lives — or at least be aware that what they disclose can influence public perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just what researchers themselves say that’s important, but also the context in which the research is presented. In a final study, participants read about a fictitious scientific conference on psychedelic drugs. All were given the same description of the scientific programme, but some read that various social events were happening which had associations with psychedelic culture (e.g. a shamanic drum circle and a psychedelic art exhibition), while the others read about social events which didn’t have these associations (e.g. a tour of a brewery and a postmodern art exhibition).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this case, the association with psychedelic culture did lower participants’ perceptions of the quality of the research (though, interestingly, only among participants who hadn’t used psychedelic drugs themselves). “In order to positively impact the public’s perception of the quality of psychedelic research, it may be sensible to use less stereotypical imagery and language when talking about these substances, be it in media articles or scientific conferences,” the team concludes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963662520981728&quot;&gt;How psychedelic researchers’ self-admitted substance use and their association with psychedelic culture affect people’s perceptions of their scientific integrity and the quality of their research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has already been a month since we &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; we’re launching five new journals. For those of you patiently waiting, we are excited to announce that the journals are now OPEN for submissions! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The responses we’ve seen so far have been overwhelmingly positive. We’d like to say a HUGE THANK YOU to those of you who have expressed your support on social media, via email, and the many hundreds of you who have applied to join the editorial boards of the journals–we have been delighted to see how our reasons for launching them have resonated with you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The journals’ websites now contain much more information on each  journal’s mission, scope, personnel, submission instructions and hopefully everything you need to consider submitting your work:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/climate&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Climate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Sustainability and Transformation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/water&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Digital Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Global Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If what you want to do is explore the journal most relevant to you, and consider it for your future work, please consider this blog post an appropriate “jumping off point” for you to do that! In summary: we have affordable, APC-free business models for all our journals available through institutional partnerships which allow unlimited publishing by all authors at the institution. We also have publishing fees/APCs for those who still need or prefer them, and an established APC-waiver program for those who cannot afford APCs but whose institutions are not yet under an institutional agreement. &lt;strong&gt;Please presume there is a way, that is appropriate for you and your context, that you will be able to publish in these new journals!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those of you who want to know more details about our institutional models, in particular librarians and others managing Open Access budgets, please read &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/open-for-submissions-part-2-models/&quot;&gt;Part 2 of this announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Our five new journals are now &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/open-for-submissions-part-1/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open for Submissions&lt;/a&gt;! This post (Part 2) is specifically geared towards librarians and/or those of you who manage budgets that support Open Access publishing. Or, simply those of you who would like more details about how we are supporting our activities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you have been keeping up to date with our business model innovations, you already know we have been working hard to move beyond the APC to develop more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access. In the past eighteen months we’ve developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flat Fee &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;greements&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Community Action Publishing&lt;/a&gt;. (Please see those links for the full details or recap of those models.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re developing new institutional models to experiment and get things right, and we thank all of you in the library community who have given us feedback. We’re learning that, right now, different types of journals can be better supported by different types of institutional models. Also, we’ve learned that some authors, funders, and countries still prefer APCs due to how they are currently funding or administering their OA publishing. We will continue to support such publication fee models for those who prefer or need them, while continuing to experiment with and develop these new institutional models to make OA work for all authors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutional models for the five new journals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Digital Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; joins the group of journals covered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flat Fee agreements&lt;/a&gt; (covering &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Digital Health, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Sustainability and Transformation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has its own &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Community Action Publishing&lt;/a&gt; setup, similar to &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine, &lt;/em&gt;to showcase how CAP can work for new journals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/climate/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Climate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/water/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Global Public Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; offer a new type of institutional business model, which we are naming the “Global Equity” model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Equity &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our new Global Equity model empowers institutions in every region of the world to provide unlimited Open Access publication support for their authors through a single, annual fee that is affordable and equitably reflects regional economies. The annual fee is based on:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an &lt;strong&gt;institution’s &lt;/strong&gt;research output in the relevant &lt;strong&gt;subject area&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;helping us understand the likely potential to publish in the journal, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the relevant &lt;strong&gt;country’s &lt;/strong&gt;World Bank lending tier (i.e. Low/Low-Middle Income Country (L/LMIC), Upper Middle Income Country (UMIC), High Income Country (HIC). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Global Equity model’s annual price will therefore allow a large institution in a LMIC to pay less than one of comparable size in an HIC, but more than a small institution in an LMIC. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors at institutions in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.research4life.org/access/eligibility/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research4Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (R4L) countries (both group A and group B) can publish for free, regardless of the size of the institution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The following table shows the annual prices for institutions, per journal. Tier 1 is a high output institution in the subject area, to Tier 6 being a low output institution in the subject area. For example, a low output institution in a LMIC interested in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Climate &lt;/em&gt;would pay &lt;strong&gt;$350&lt;/strong&gt; per year to cover unlimited publishing by its authors in that journal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-table&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;has-fixed-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;HIC&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;UMIC&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;L/LMIC&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tier 1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$6,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$5,400&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,100&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tier 2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$4,500&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$4,050&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1,575&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tier 3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$3,750&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$3,375&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1,313&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tier 4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$3,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,700&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1,050&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tier 5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1,800&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$700&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tier 6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$900&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$350&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;R4L&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Global Equity model prices by research output tier and country category&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary Information and Comparison Table&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of you reading this post are likely librarians or other people administering OA budgets. However, if you are an author and are simply interested in submitting to a PLOS journal that is of interest to you, &lt;strong&gt;please presume&lt;/strong&gt; there is a way, &lt;strong&gt;that is appropriate for you and your context&lt;/strong&gt;, that you will be able to publish in these new journals:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If APCs do not work for you and you would like your institution to join any of these institutional agreements, please send your librarian this &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/contact-plos/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, or refer them via this &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/refer/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are a librarian, please contact us via this &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/contact-plos/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If APCs are preferred, or are necessary for you, they are listed in the table below. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/publish/fees/#fee-assistance&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;waiver policies and fee assistance programs&lt;/a&gt; for APCs are unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Below is a table that summarizes the information for our entire portfolio of twelve journals, with the five new journals indicated.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The world is not exactly short of videos of cute cats up to strange antics. But one particular set of videos collected by cat owners during a COVID-19 lockdown reveals something genuinely interesting: a famous optical illusion that fools us also gets cats. The citizen science project, in which cats were experimented on in their own homes, shows that they, too, are tricked by “Kanizsa squares”, an illusion that suggests the presence of a square that doesn’t in fact exist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42227&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s well known that cats love to sit in enclosed spaces, like boxes. They even like to sit in square shapes made of tape, as documented during a 2017 Twitter craze (#CatSquare). So in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159121001258?dgcid=coauthor&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Applied Animal Behaviour Science&lt;/em&gt;, Gabriella E. Smith at City University of New York and colleagues took this further, to see if cats also show a preference for illusory squares.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of the 500 pet cats and owners who signed up to take part, 30 completed all the trials. The owners “were not aware of the study’s investigative purpose at any point before or during the experiment”, the authors write. (Well, they weren’t told what it was about, at least.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every day for six days, each owner put their cat out of the room while they taped a pair of stimuli to the floor. The researchers instructed them each day on which two of three stimuli to use: an actual square, a Kanizsa square (in which four Pacman-type cut-outs are arranged to suggest the lines of a square) and the Kanizsa control (in which the Pacman-type cut-outs face the other way.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-42231&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;42231&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;0&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Smith-et-al-2021&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Smith-et-al-2021.png?fit=845%2C508&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Smith-et-al-2021.png?fit=300%2C180&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Smith-et-al-2021.png?fit=875%2C526&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;875,526&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/05/24/cats-like-to-sit-in-squares-even-ones-that-are-really-optical-illusions/smith-et-al-2021/&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;505&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Smith-et-al-2021.png?resize=842%2C505&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; width=&quot;842&quot; /&gt;Examples of Kanizsa squares (right) paired with the Kanizsa control (top panel) and actual square (bottom panel). &lt;em&gt;Via &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159121001258?dgcid=coauthor&quot;&gt;Smith et al (2021)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The owner then put on sunglasses (so their cat couldn’t use their gaze as a cue to what to do), brought the cat into the room, and started videoing. If, within five minutes, their pet sat or stood within either of the shapes, the trial ended. Either way, after five minutes, they submitted the result.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of those 30 cats who completed all the trials, nine cats chose to inside a stimulus at least once — and, in total between them, 16 times. On eight of these occasions, a cat sat inside an actual square. On seven, it sat inside a Kanizsa square. In contrast, the Kanizsa control was chosen only once. This suggests that cats treat the Kanizsa squares just like real ones. Like us (and dogs, chimps, and many other animals, in fact) they show “susceptibility to illusory contours.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recruiting pet owners to do experiments themselves clearly has some downsides. Very few of those who signed up actually completed the full study. Also, light levels might have varied quite a bit across the various homes, and this could have influenced the cats’ decisions, the team notes. However, there are also good reasons to study cats in their own homes, rather than a lab. As they’re more relaxed at home, their behaviour is likely to be more natural.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study provides further evidence that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/09/heres-the-first-evidence-that-even-lizards-succumb-to-optical-illusions/&quot;&gt;animals experience all kinds of illusions&lt;/a&gt;. But it also gives further insight into cat cognition, which has received little attention compared to that of dogs. Quite why not isn’t clear. However, given the useful, if limited, data from this new study, the researchers write: “the use of citizen science as a precursor to in-lab investigations of cat cognition could greatly help bridge this divide.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159121001258?dgcid=coauthor&quot;&gt;If I fits I sits: A citizen science investigation into illusory contour susceptibility in domestic cats (&lt;em&gt;Felis silvestris catus&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/©-BillionPhotos.com_-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are all aware of the effect COVID-19 has had on our day-to-day lives, but how about COVID’s effects on academia? The COVID-19 pandemic caused an outbreak of scientific evidence. As of April 2021, the number of unique publications indexed by our &lt;a href=&quot;https://zika.ispm.unibe.ch/assets/data/pub/search_beta/&quot;&gt;living evidence database&lt;/a&gt;, created to retrieve COVID-19 publications, exceeded 160,000. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01244-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;our research&lt;/a&gt;, we compared the patterns of scientific publications for the two infections, the Zika virus emergence in 2016 and SARS-CoV-2, to assess the evolution of the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The living evidence database was created initially for retrieving publications on Zika virus. In 2016, we included around 50-60 new Zika virus articles per week in our database. We thought it would be an easy transition to switch to indexing COVID-19 articles in late 2019. However, we were shocked by the sheer volume of published articles retrieved, which came to around 2,500 articles per week at the end of April 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the evidence evaluation for Zika virus, we identified and classified 2,286 publications in 2016. However, for SARS-CoV-2, although we recruited a group of international volunteer scientists with a background in health sciences to cope with the volume, we were only able to analyze a random sample of 5,294 (24%) out of 21,990 articles that were published before 24 May 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A substantial proportion of articles indexed were non-original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proportions of epidemiological study designs&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Our findings showed that a substantial proportion of articles indexed were non-original (commentaries, basic reviews, opinion papers, etc.) for both Zika virus (55%) and SARS-CoV-2 (34%, [95% Confidence interval (Cl): 33-35]). The role of preprints was more prominent at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic than the Zika virus epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case reports and case series accounted for approximately 10% of the total body of evidence for both SARS-CoV-2 (10.7% [95% CI: 9.9-11.6]) and Zika virus (9.7%) research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case-control and cohort studies accounted for 4.0% [95% CI: 3.5-4.6] for SARS-CoV-2 and 0.8% for Zika virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trials emerged in smaller numbers (27/5,294 for SARS -CoV-2, and 1/2,286 for Zika virus) and at the beginning of the outbreak, there were more mathematical modelling studies for SARS-CoV-2 (10.1%, [95% CI: 9.3-11.0]), when compared with Zika virus (3.2%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-study type trends&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Case reports, case series and cross-sectional studies were the first epidemiological study designs to be reported, together with non-original articles and reviews. Case-control and cohort studies followed later; this delay was more prominent in the Zika virus research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; laboratory studies followed between case reports and controlled observational studies. Trials were the last type of study to be published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it all mean?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Emerging infectious diseases are accompanied by a vast quantity of published evidence quickly, which is a significant challenge that clinicians, scientists, researchers, and even students have to face. Keeping up with the available evidence becomes a complicated task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed of SARS-CoV-2 evidence accumulation was unprecedented. Although we recruited a large team of experienced scientists, we reached a point where we could not categorize all the evidence retrieved by our database within the first few months of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tackle this issue, we believe the use of natural language processing methods to help classify and categorize evidence seems like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0895-4356(17)30604-2&quot;&gt;promising approach for the triage of publication&lt;/a&gt; types not only for SARS-CoV-2 but for future emerging diseases. Also, collaborative crowd-sourcing within scientists in the field could increase researchers’ efficiency and &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(13)62329-6&quot;&gt;prevent research waste&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assessing the evidence during emerging infections can help us identify which types of public health questions we can answer and when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessing the evidence during emerging infections can help us identify which types of public health questions we can answer and when. Further research on evidence evaluation during emerging outbreaks could help improve the public health response. With the accumulation of evidence during particular situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of specific resources can save time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the amount of evidence published every day on this non-ending pandemic, students, clinicians, and stakeholders need to approach the published studies with caution. Some of the studies available might be providing wrong findings or conclusions, and people might ‘cherry pick’ what aligns with their beliefs. We need critical eyes to scrutinize all available evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Shabnam Kadir will talk about a paper &quot;Feasibility of Topological Data Analysis for Event-Related fMRI&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent fMRI research shows that perceptual and cognitive representations are
instantiated in high-dimensional multivoxel patterns in the brain. However, the
methods for detecting these representations are limited. Topological data
analysis (TDA) is a new approach, based on the mathematical field of topology,
that can detect unique types of geometric features in patterns of data. Several
recent studies have successfully applied TDA to study various forms of neural
data; however, to our knowledge, TDA has not been successfully applied to data
from event-related fMRI designs. Event-related fMRI is very common but limited
in terms of the number of events that can be run within a practical time frame
and the effect size that can be expected. Here, we investigate whether
persistent homology- a popular TDA tool that identifies topological
features in data and quantifies their robustness- can identify known
signals given these constraints. We use fmrisim, a Python-based simulator of
realistic fMRI data, to assess the plausibility of recovering a simple
topological representation under a variety of conditions. Our results suggest
that persistent homology can be used under certain circumstances to recover
topological structure embedded in realistic fMRI data simulations.How do we
represent the world? In cognitive neuroscience it is typical to think
representations are points in high-dimensional space. In order to study these
kinds of spaces it is necessary to have tools that capture the organization of
high- dimensional data. Topological data analysis (TDA) holds promise for
detecting unique types of geometric features in patterns of data. Although
potentially useful, TDA has not been applied to event-related fMRI data. Here
we utilized a popular tool from TDA, persistent homology, to recover
topological signals from event-related fMRI data. We simulated realistic fMRI
data and explored the parameters under which persistent homology can
successfully extract signal. We also provided extensive code and
recommendations for how to make the most out of TDA for fMRI analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;Red sign with slogan 'Keep calm and stay home'&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12397 alignright&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/30140872-278x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;246&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;In an interesting analysis, researchers from Technical University in Munich and the University of Cambridge investigated the difference in the response to COVID-19 pandemic between Germany and UK residents. Their findings (published now in &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychology&lt;/em&gt;) highlight a striking discrepancy how responders from both countries rated the impact of the pandemic on their financial situation as well as their personal outlook: While German participants reported a lower impact in terms of loss of work and income, they were less hopeful that the pandemic would end soon compared with British participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, both populations showed an increase in symptoms of mental illnesses, most prominently depression and anxieties, induced or worsened by the pandemic. This alarming increase calls for a better public awareness of mental health and mental illness as well as better access to help in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comparison between Germany and the UK is particularly interesting because both countries are economically and culturally very similar. However, the initial response to the pandemic differed between both countries, with Germany locking down considerably earlier than the UK, which has been shown to have impacted number of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the data for this study was collected during the first lockdown in both countries (April/May 2020) it will be interesting to see how the mental health response has changed over the course of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-021-00620-8?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Medical Ethics – Research integrity, misconduct and consequences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Research ethics is a hot topic not only in the science community but is also garnering wide-spread attention among the public. Especially in recent years, cases of prominent researchers suspected of misconduct have been highly publicised across news outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12396&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12396 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-1033540402-1-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;© Warchi / Getty Images / iStock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;In a recent study published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Ethics&lt;/em&gt;, researchers from Hungary, Ireland, the UK and Norway collected and analysed data concerning cases of research misconduct available in scientific journals. Interestingly, the field of natural sciences (41.5%) was found to have the most cases in relation to number of publications in the field, followed by health and medical sciences (25.1%) and engineering (22%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The most prevalent misconduct category was fabrication and falsification of data with non-adherence to pertinent laws such as informed consent and ethics approval ranking second. Additionally, the researchers assessed the consequences for research misconduct finding paper retraction (45.4%) and exclusion from funding applications (35.5%) to be the most common sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The authors of this study further criticise that retraction notices often do not contain sufficient detail, thus impeding transparency of the retraction process. Comprehensive analyses such as this study guide the research community in finding ways to prevent misconduct and upholding research integrity standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01268-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Medical Research Methodology – Equity in clinical trial registration – Why are places of higher disease prevalence not (yet) aligned with trial locations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Clinical trials aimed to investigate treatment options for specific illnesses often do not recruit from populations with high prevalence of the respective disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12398&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Group of healthcare workers and patients of different ages and ethnicities in a huddle all with hands in smiling at the hospital.&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12398&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-1141832721-1-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;© Hispanolistic / Getty Images / iStock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;This geographical mismatch affects both the quality of care and the validity or generalisability of results and funding bodies are working towards a more equal distribution. Researchers and funding bodies are becoming increasingly aware of these issues, prompting researchers from the University of Oxford to investigate why this mismatch exists and how chief investigators (CIs) of clinical trials can be supported to achieve a more equitable distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The results of their qualitative study have now been published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Research Methodology&lt;/em&gt; revealing that the main factors in site selection for CIs is to ensure a successful trial procedure and the risk associated with choosing less research-active sites. Mainly, CIs are conscious of potential issues with patient recruitment and retention and are concerned with the effect a less successful trial might have on their reputation and future funding opportunities. This often leads to CIs selecting sites where they have a personal contact or with which they have collaborated in the past, thereby perpetuating this system of inequity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The authors suggest strategies to mitigate these perceived risk factors and incentivise chief investigators to align their research sites with the location of disease prevalence while highlighting the benefits experienced by CIs who have previously ‘broken the mould’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-021-05552-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Research Notes – Reforesting our planet using nitrogen-fixing legumes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Awareness of the importance of the tropical rain forests and forests in general for our global climate has grown over the last few years and forest restoration is crucial in our efforts to prevent a climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Reforestation programmes are on the rise, but a main hindrance to restoring a diverse plant life are often depleted soils that have lost nutrients and minerals through monocultural farming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12399&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Hand of a farmer nurturing a young green plant with natural green background .&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12399&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-614115058-1-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;© weerapatkiatdumrong / Getty Images / iStock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Brazilian researchers present data on the use of different legume plants in restoration efforts, published now in &lt;em&gt;BMC Research Notes&lt;/em&gt;. Nitrogen-fixing legumes are a useful tool to restore soils and offer a good basis for second-generation plants, but the process is often slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By measuring biomass growth of reforestation blocks treated with different fertilisation regimens, the researchers were able to show a fundamental role for additional fertilisation during the early stages of plantation development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings will be important for policymakers in setting up strategies to mitigate global warming and retrieve carbon from our atmosphere using natural fixation by plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12400&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Problem child and desperate mother at psychological centre.&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12400&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-639794730-1-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;© KatarzynaBialasiewicz / Getty Images / iStock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-021-02631-1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder leading to learning disabilities or social dysfunction in affected children with symptoms often lasting into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Previous research has shown that children with ADHD often have lower serum levels of vitamin D and magnesium, but few studies have been conducted to assess the effect of vitamin D/magnesium supplementation on behavioural issues of children diagnosed with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;In a study published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt; Hemamy and colleagues present data from a randomised, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of vitamin D/Mg supplementation on Iranian children with ADHD. Interestingly, the researchers find significant improvement in several behavioural variables including emotional and peer problems, where children in the treatment group scored significantly better than those receiving a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;This research lays the groundwork for bigger clinical trials investigating the impact of vitamin D and magnesium on the behaviour of children with ADHD as well as the underlying physiological mechanism leading to potentially new treatment recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/Module-1-screenshot-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few institutions provide training on strategies for increasing diversity among clinical trial participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many research teams struggle to recruit racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials, despite increasing awareness of the need for diversity. Unfortunately, few institutions provide training for research teams on strategies for increasing diversity among clinical trial participants. To address this need, we developed a massive open online course, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/recruitment-minorities-clinical-trials&quot;&gt;Faster Together&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the course is to help individuals involved in the clinical research enterprise (including investigators, recruiters, and clinical research coordinators), gain the knowledge and skills needed to successfully recruit and retain racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01240-x&quot;&gt;our manuscript&lt;/a&gt;, we describe the design, implementation, and initial evaluation results based on the ten-month period since the course was released. Briefly, the course was developed through a collaborative process involving a team of content experts, knowledge management information scientists, and videographers. Community feedback was incorporated throughout the course development process through consultation with the Recruitment Innovation Center Community Advisory Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/recruitment-minorities-clinical-trials&quot;&gt;course&lt;/a&gt; consists of eight modules, which can each be completed within an hour. The individual modules are divided into short (~10 minute) segments to try to make it easier for learners to complete the training when they have available time. The modules focus on topics including understanding the need for diversity in clinical research, barriers and facilitators to participation, community engagement strategies, pre-screening, consent, and retention. The course content is freely available, and learners can work at their own pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, feedback from course participants has been positive, and participants have indicated that the course increased their knowledge of the topic. It remains to be seen whether participation in the course will translate to changes in minority enrollment in clinical trials. However, the majority of learners in our study reported that they intended to alter their recruitment practices as a result of their course participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training on its own will not lead to changes, unless supplemented by actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that initiatives such as our course will ultimately result in more equitable representation of minorities in clinical trials. Achieving diversity in research participation is necessary to be able to understand whether the findings of a given study will be relevant for different populations. We recognize that training on its own will not lead to changes, unless supplemented by actions. Changes may be needed at the individual, team, and institutional levels. Responding to the call for increased diversity in clinical trial participation is one of many critical steps we can take to help reduce health disparities and promote health equity.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;To infer spike rates from calcium imaging data for a time point &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;, knowledge about the calcium signal both before and after time &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; is required. Our algorithm &lt;em&gt;Cascade&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;) uses by default a window that is symmetric in time and feeds this window into a small deep network to use the data points in the window for spike inference (schematic below taken from Fig. 2A of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt;; CC-BY-NC 4.0):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6807&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6807&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;figure-2a_mod&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-2a_mod.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-2a_mod.png?w=215&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-2a_mod.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;956,1331&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/figure-2a_mod/&quot; height=&quot;483&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-2a_mod.png?w=735&quot; width=&quot;347&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, if one wants to perform spike inference not as a post-processing step but rather during the experiment (“online spike inference”), it would be ideal to perform spike inference with a delay as short as possible. This would allow for example to use the result of spike inference for a closed-loop interaction with the animal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ringachlab.net/&quot;&gt;Dario Ringach&lt;/a&gt; recently came up with this interesting problem. With the Cascade algorithm already set up, I was curious to check very specifically: How many time points (i.e., imaging frames) are required after time point &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; to perform reliable spike inference?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using GCaMP/mouse datasets from the large ground truth database (the database is again described in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt;), I addressed this question directly by training separate models. For each model, the time window was shifted such that a variable number of data points (between minimally 1 and maximally 32) were used for spike inference. Everything was evaluated at a typical frame rate of 30 Hz, and also at different noise levels of the recordings (color-coded below); a noise level of “2” is pretty decent, while a noise level of “8” is quite noisy – explained with examples (Fig. S3) and equations (Methods) again in the preprint.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6810&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6810&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;figure-1-2&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;869,726&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/figure-1-2/&quot; height=&quot;264&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png?w=869&quot; width=&quot;317&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results are quite clear: For low noise levels (black curve, SEM across datasets as corridor), spike inference seems to reach a saturating performance (correlation with ground truth spike rates) around a value of almost 8 frames. This would result in a delay of almost 8*33 ms ≈ 260 ms after a spiking event (dashed line).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But let’s have a closer look. The above curve was averaged across 8 datasets, mixing different indicators (GCaMP6f and GCaMP6s) and induction methods (transgenic mouse lines and AAV-based induction). Below, I looked into the curve for each single dataset (for the noise level of 2).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is immediately clear that for some datasets fewer frames after &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; are sufficient for almost optimal spike inference, for others not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6812&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6812&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;figure-1-3&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;2022,665&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/figure-1-3/&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png?w=1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the best datasets, optimal performance is already reached with 4 frames (left panel; delay of ca. 120 ms). These are datasets #10 and #11, which use the fast indicator GCaMP6f, which in addition is here transgenically expressed. The corresponding spike-triggered linear kernels (right side; copied from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2&quot;&gt;Fig. S1 of the preprint&lt;/a&gt;) are indeed faster than for other datasets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two datasets with GCaMP6s (datasets #15 and #16) stand out as non-ideal, requiring almost 16 frames after &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; before optimal performance is reached. Probably, expression levels in these experiment using AAV-based approaches were very high, resulting in &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2018.09.005&quot;&gt;calcium buffering&lt;/a&gt; and therefore slower transients. The corresponding spike-triggered linear kernels are indeed much slower than for the other GCaMP6s- or GCaMP6f-based datasets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The script used to perform the above evaluations can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade/blob/master/etc/Evaluate_delay_online_spike_inference.py&quot;&gt;Cascade’s Github repository&lt;/a&gt;. Since each data point requires retraining the model from scratch, it cannot be run on a CPU in reasonable time. On a RTX 2080 Ti, the script took 2-3 days to complete.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; Only few frames (down to 4 frames) after time&lt;em&gt; t&lt;/em&gt; are sufficient to perform almost ideal spike inference. This is probably a consequence of the fact that the sharp step increase is more informative than the slow decay of a spike-triggered event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To optimize the experiment for online spike-inference, it is helpful to use a fast indicator (e.g., GCaMP6f). It also seems that transgenic expression might be an advantage, since indicator expression and calcium buffering is typically lower for transgenic expression than for viral induction, preventing a slow-down of the indicator by overexpression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce our collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://paperswithcode.com/&quot;&gt;Papers With Code&lt;/a&gt; to support links to datasets on &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning articles on arXiv now have a Code &amp;amp; Data tab to link to datasets that are used or introduced in a paper. Readers can activate Links to Code &amp;amp; Data from the paper abstract page to see links to official code, community implementations of the code, and the datasets used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_979&quot; style=&quot;width: 400px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot of links to datasets from arXiv abstract pages&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-979 size-full&quot; height=&quot;539&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/PwC-Data-Screen-Shot-2021-05-10-at-4.00.24-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;From the “Code &amp;amp; Data” tab on the arXiv article abstract page, readers can find links to datasets used in the paper.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors can add datasets to their arXiv papers by going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/login&quot;&gt;arxiv.org/user&lt;/a&gt; and clicking on the “Link to code &amp;amp; data” Papers with Code icon (see below). From there they will be directed to Papers with Code where they can add their datasets. Once added, these will show on the arXiv article’s abstract page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes tracking dataset usage across the community and quickly finding other papers using the same dataset easier. From Papers with Code, readers can discover other papers using the same dataset, track usage over time, compare models, and find similar datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All data on Papers with Code is freely available and is licensed under CC-BY-SA (same as Wikipedia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An arXivLabs Collaboration&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv’s mission is to provide an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant, emerging science and establish their contribution to advancing research. Datasets are a critical component of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second stage of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/28/arxivlabs-a-space-for-community-innovation/&quot;&gt;arXivLabs collaboration&lt;/a&gt; with Papers with Code, following &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/08/new-arxivlabs-feature-provides-instant-access-to-code/&quot;&gt;the introduction of code on arXiv&lt;/a&gt; last October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Members of our community want to contribute tools that enhance the arXiv experience, and we value that kind of community engagement,” said Eleonora Presani, arXiv Executive Director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago we &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; five new journals and their role in our plans to spread our roots deeper and absorb researchers and local practices more fully into our business. However, this is only one part of our work in this area. In the transition to an Open future we need to keep asking ourselves “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/theme-of-2019-international-open-access-week-to-be-open-for-whom-&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open for Whom?&lt;/a&gt;” Openness in itself, while valuable, does not tackle inequality in the scholarly communications ecosystem, or increase inclusion.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we need to be intentional in addressing power imbalances and the legacy of devaluing knowledge from particular groups or regions, e.g. from communities often marginalized in North American/Western European publications, including researchers from Low-to-Middle-Income countries. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this year we will be expanding our presence into different continents, embedding ourselves into local communities to work alongside them, listening and learning, so that we can understand and reflect their needs and values.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today&lt;/strong&gt;, as our first major step, we’re sharing the wonderful news that we are formally partnering with the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tcc-africa.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Training Centre in Communication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, based in the University of Nairobi, Kenya, commonly known as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tcc-africa.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TCC Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. TCC Africa is a nonprofit trust that has been doing valuable work across the continent since 2006. They’re committed to improving African researchers’ visibility (and therefore impact) through training in scholarly communication. Like us, they are heavily invested in an Open future and work with stakeholders across the scholarly communication ecosystem to promote and increase uptake of open access and open science more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Working with TCC Africa will help us to ensure that the interests and values of African research communities are represented in PLOS publications, policies, and services and to ensure that Open Science practices work for local stakeholders. We believe that all Open Science and Open Research activities should be informed and co-created by local communities at a global scale, helping us all to rebuild the system better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve started to build our strategic plan to achieve our joint goals: it’s the first step on our path to a more inclusive Open Science future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please follow PLOS and TCC Africa on social media, and/or follow our blogs, to keep up to date on the progress of this partnership!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Nik Dennler will talk about a paper &quot;Event-Driven Sensing for Efficient Perception: Vision and Audition Algorithms&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event sensors implement circuits that capture partial functionality of
biological sensors, such as the retina and cochlea. As with their
biological counterparts, event sensors are drivers of their own
output. That is, they produce dynamically sampled binary events to
dynamically changing stimuli. Algorithms and networks that process
this form of output representation are still in their infancy, but
they show strong promise. This article illustrates the unique form of
the data produced by the sensors and demonstrates how the properties
of these sensor outputs make them useful for power-efficient,
low-latency systems working in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2021/05/12/10-years-of-brainhack-an-open-inclusive-culture-for-neuro-tool-developers-at-all-levels/"/>
		<id>https://malinsandstrom.blog/?p=2064</id>
		<updated>2021-05-12T09:53:12+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Brainhacks and similar formats are increasingly recognized as a new way of providing academic training and conducting research that extends traditional settings. There is a new paper out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(21)00231-2&quot;&gt;in Neuron&lt;/a&gt;, by 200+ authors, describing the format and what makes it valuable to the community. This post aims to highlight some of the core themes of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brainhacks have been held since 2012, organized by local communities, sometimes in sync with other hackathons taking place elsewhere. In 2016 the format developed into the Brainhack Global – a synchronous swarm of hybrid meetings arranged by local communities with local and virtual participants. In 2020, during the pandemic, the BG went fully virtual.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QyhV2wtej9eq5z6i1cL-fT0EGPWLrwHdjZgIbB08cnLkFLkQhWFXRyCzbzKWM52ah7uOSEJrmnbD2CSdk-Y1sDM8LsJMaaAeN_PUF_c57duNgo-8PomZvXEhqgtPsni1GdRN7VXq&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Figure 1D from &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.04.001&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.04.001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A similar growth of hackathons has occurred in communities adjacent to Brainhack. INCF started funding hackathons early because our community asked for it; and when we saw the value and inspiration hackathons brought to the community, it became a regular line item in the INCF budget. Since funding our first hackathon in 2012, we have funded or partially funded at least one hackathon each year (see our entry in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainhack.org/brainhack_jupyter_book/acknowledgments.html&quot;&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Brainhack format is inspired by the hackathon model and centers on ad-hoc, informal collaborations for building, updating and extending community software tools developed by the participants’ peers, with the goal to have functioning software by the end of the event. Unlike many hackathons, Brainhacks welcome participants from all disciplines and with any level of experience—from those who have never written a line of code to software developers and expert neuroscientists, and also feature informal dissemination of ongoing research through unconferences. Also unlike some traditional hackathons, Brainhacks do not have competitions. Brainhacks value education; recent major Brainhack events even have a TrainTrack, a set of entirely education-focused sessions that run in parallel with regular hacking on projects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;The five defining Brainhack features: &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;1) a project-oriented approach that fosters active participation and community-driven problem-solving&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2) learning by doing, which enables participants to gain more intensive training, particularly in computational methods&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3) training in open science and collaborative coding, which helps participants become more effective collaborators&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;4) focus on reproducibility, which leads to more robust scientific research; and &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;5) accelerated building and bridging of communities, which encourages inclusivity and seamless collaboration between researchers at different career stages&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brainhacks have increased insight in the value of tool usability and reusability and the need for long-term maintenance; shifting community culture from individuals creating tools for their own needs to a community actively contributing to an existing resource. They also help to disseminate good practices for writing code and documentation, ensuring code readability, using version control and licensing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brainhacks promote awareness of reproducible practices that integrate easily into research workflows, and show the value of data sharing and open data. They introduce participants to data standards, such as BIDS, allowing them to experience the benefits of a unified data organization and provides them with the skillset to use these formats in their own research. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brainhacks create a scientific culture around open and standardized data, metadata, and methods, as well as detailed documentation and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Brainhack community are currently also working to collate Brainhack-related insights and expertise into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainhack.org/brainhack_jupyter_book/&quot;&gt;Jupyter Book &lt;/a&gt; that will serve as a centralized set of resources for the community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LINKS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Maria Psarrou will talk about a paper &quot;Fast Odour Dynamics Are Encoded in the Olfactory System and Guide Behaviour&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odours are transported in turbulent plumes, which result in rapid concentration
fluctuations that contain rich information about the olfactory scenery, such as
the composition and location of an odour source. However, it is unclear whether
the mammalian olfactory system can use the underlying temporal structure to
extract information about the environment. Here we show that ten-millisecond
odour pulse patterns produce distinct responses in olfactory receptor neurons.
In operant conditioning experiments, mice discriminated temporal correlations
of rapidly fluctuating odours at frequencies of up to 40 Hz. In imaging and
electrophysiological recordings, such correlation information could be readily
extracted from the activity of mitral and tufted cells the output neurons of
the olfactory bulb. Furthermore, temporal correlation of odour concentrations
reliably predicted whether odorants emerged from the same or different sources
in naturalistic environments with complex airflow. Experiments in which mice
were trained on such tasks and probed using synthetic correlated stimuli at
different frequencies suggest that mice can use the temporal structure of
odours to extract information about space. Thus, the mammalian olfactory system
has access to unexpectedly fast temporal features in odour stimuli. This endows
animals with the capacity to overcome key behavioural challenges such as odour
source separation, figure ground segregation and odour localization by
extracting information about space from temporal odour dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2021/05/05/northeastern-university-professor-with-69-papers-on-pubpeer-has-resigned/"/>

		<updated>2021-05-05T22:44:12+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;A chemistry professor at Northeastern University in Boston, MA who has almost 70 papers flagged on PubPeer resigned yesterday, May 4, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On his blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://forbetterscience.com/2020/03/19/thomas-webster-to-save-the-world-with-covid-19-nanoparticles/&quot;&gt;For Better Science&lt;/a&gt; (Update May 5, at the bottom), Leonid Schneider shared an email from the Chair of the Department of Engineering, which states that Thomas J Webster has resigned from the university. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Webster has &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Thomas+J+Webster%22&quot;&gt;69 papers flagged on PubPeer&lt;/a&gt;, mostly for concerns about image irregularities. I reported 59 to the journals and institution in March 2020. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-2562&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of these papers, which appeared to have duplications of features within the same photo, were quietly corrected. Perhaps coincidentally, these had been published in the  Elsevier journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.elsevier.com/nanomedicine-nanotechnology-biology-and-medicine/editorial-board&quot;&gt;Nanomedicine : Nanotechnology, Biology, and Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, where Webster is an Associate Editor. See e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/582FCA40E662923EAC611828E80CBE&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The apparent duplications in the colorful image on the right below this text were &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C&quot;&gt;explained by the first author on PubPeer &lt;/a&gt;as  “&lt;em&gt;the voltage of the instrument is not insufficient in that time, so that the carbon membrane (which was bought homemade) on the copper screen may affect the background and the resolution of the picture, which leads to this fuzzy image, bringing you some identification troubles&lt;/em&gt;” —  sort of blaming me for seeing these duplications. You may remember that I awarded the journal a &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2020/11/15/nanomedicine-nanotechnology-biology-and-medicine-wins-third-this-image-is-fine-award/&quot;&gt;This Image Is Fine Award&lt;/a&gt; in November 2020. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The image got replaced with something less obnoxious, without the journal even blinking when the authors wrote &lt;em&gt;“there was an inadvertent mistake for Figure 3, B which appeared as a replicated image”&lt;/em&gt;. In my professional opinion, both images contain duplicated parts — and both papers should have been retracted. But the journal had a severe conflict of interest in both cases. One of the senior authors is an Associate Editor at the journal, so the papers were not handled according to COPE guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-2567&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;2567&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm.png?w=840&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;2664,1250&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.com/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3-15-32-pm/&quot; src=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm.png?w=1024&quot; /&gt;Two examples of papers with severe image concerns, published in a journal where one of the senior author serves on the Editorial Board. In both cases, the authors were allowed to replace these figures with a clean panel, and the paper got a correction. From: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/582FCA40E662923EAC611828E80CBE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://pubpeer.com/publications/582FCA40E662923EAC611828E80CBE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several other papers with image problems were published in Dove’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dovepress.com/journal-editor-international-journal-of-nanomedicine-eic5&quot;&gt;International Journal of Nanomedicine&lt;/a&gt;, where Webster is the founding Editor-in-Chief, and not surprisingly these have not been acted upon. It is always complicated to investigate such cases if one of the authors is the founding father of the journal. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the muddy corrections at the journals, it has to be said that Northeastern University appears to have handled this case appropriately and swiftly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As reported by For Better Science, the Webster lab was suspended in November 2020, and now in May 2021 Webster has left the university. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, only 8 of these 69 papers have been corrected so far (and as we have seen above, that was not always a good decision), while as of today zero papers have been retracted. I hope the university will contact the journals with the findings of their investigation, advising them which of these cases involved research misconduct. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<id>https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18855</id>
		<updated>2021-05-05T12:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emily Chenette, Editor-in-Chief, PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS empowers researchers to transform science by offering more options for credit, transparency and choice. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/submit-your-lab-and-study-protocols-plos-one/&quot;&gt;launch&lt;/a&gt; of Lab Protocols and Study Protocols in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year supported this crucial goal by bringing reproducibility and transparency to research, and enabling those who contributed to study design to receive credit for their contributions.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re delighted to share the news that two Study Protocols have now been published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249435&quot;&gt;Satoru Joshita and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, describes a protocol for studying the prevalence and etiology of portopulmonary hypertension in a cohort of Japanese people with chronic liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248791&quot;&gt;John Cole and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, provides the protocol for the Copy Number Variation and Stroke (CaNVAS) Risk and Outcome study. This study aims to identify copy-number variations that are associated with a risk of ischemic stroke in diverse populations. &lt;/p&gt;


      &lt;div class=&quot; block-image-text block-image-text--left&quot; id=&quot;block-image-text--block_6092e00c8ebdc&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__image  block-image-text__image--25&quot;&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;379&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/cole-john-head.jpg&quot; width=&quot;263&quot; /&gt;
                      &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__text&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Cole writes, “Very little is known about the genetics of stroke outcome. In CaNVAS, copy number variation (CNV) variation as associated with both stroke-risk and-outcome will be explored on a large scale basis. Providing the scientific community with the CaNVAS protocol early in the study will help identify other researchers interested in these efforts, with the goal to increase collaboration and scientific discovery regarding CNV throughout the project.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    


&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, by having their Study Protocols reviewed and published, these authors have had the opportunity to ensure that their study designs are robust and reproducible before the research is completed. They’re also contributing to reducing publication bias by sharing the study aims before the results are available. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in submitting your own Study Protocol for consideration, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-study-protocols&quot;&gt;Submission Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; have more information about the submission and review process. One author-friendly feature of Study Protocols is that they are eligible for expedited review if the study has received funding after peer review from an external funding source. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also encourage researchers to share their detailed, verified research methodology by publishing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-lab-protocols&quot;&gt;Lab Protocol&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;. This unique article type was developed in partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://protocols.io&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt;, and consists of two interlinked components: 1) a step-by-step protocol on protocols.io, with access to specialized tools for communicating methodological details and facilitating use of the protocol; and 2) a peer-reviewed &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; article contextualizing the protocol, with sections discussing applications, limitations and expected results. Several Lab Protocols are under review right now, and we look forward to publishing the first article soon! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thank you to our authors, reviewers, editors and readers for contributing to these article types and supporting Open Science at &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;To image neurons in vivo with a large field of view, a large objective is necessary. This big piece of metal and glass is in indirect contact with the brain surface, with only water and maybe a cover slip in between. The objective touching the brain effectively results in local cooling of the brain surface through heat conduction (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/47324&quot;&gt;Roche et al., eLife, 2019&lt;/a&gt;; see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.00557.2012&quot;&gt;Kalmbach and Waters, J Neurophysiology, 2012&lt;/a&gt;). Is this a problem?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is: Cooling by only few degrees can result in a drop of capillary blood flow and some side-effects (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/47324&quot;&gt;Roche et al., eLife, 2019&lt;/a&gt;). And it has also been shown (in slice work) that minor temperatures changes can affect the activity of astrocytic microdomains (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006349520308493&quot;&gt;Schmidt and Oheim, Biophysical J, 2020&lt;/a&gt;), which might in turn affect neuronal plasticity or even neuronal activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a specific experiment, I wanted to briefly test how such a temperature drop affects my results. Roche et al. used a commercial &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oko-lab.com/live-cell-imaging/objective-heater&quot;&gt;objective heating device&lt;/a&gt; with temperature controller, and a brief email exchange with senior author &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurotree.org/beta/peopleinfo.php?pid=9038&quot;&gt;Serge Charpak&lt;/a&gt; was quite helpful to get started. However, the tools used by Roche et al. are relatively expensive. In addition, they used a fancy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omega.co.uk/pptst/5TC.html&quot;&gt;thermocouple&lt;/a&gt; element together with a specialized amplifier from National Instruments to probe the temperature below the objective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since this was only a brief test experiment, I was hesitant to buy expensive equipment that would maybe never be used again. As a first attempt, I wrapped a heating pad, which is normally used to keep the temperature of mice during anesthesia at physiological levels, around the objective; however, the immersion medium below the objective could only heated up to something like 28°C, which is quite a bit below the desired 37°C.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6792&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6792&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;heating_pad&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1000,606&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/heating_pad-2/&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg?w=1000&quot; /&gt;Heating pad, wrapped around a 16x water immersion objective. Not hot enough.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I got in touch with Martin Wieckhorst, a very skilled technician from my institute. He suggested a more effective heating of the objective by using a very simple solution. After a layer of insulation tape (Kapton tape, see picture below), we wrapped a constantan wire, which he had available from another project, in spirals around the objective body, followed again by a layer of insulation tape. Then, using a lab power supply, we just sent some current (ca. 1A at 10 V) through the wire. The wire acts as a resistor – therefore it is important that adjacent spirals do not touch each other – and produces simply heat that is taken up by the objective body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6794&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6794&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;constantan&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1000,641&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/constantan/&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg?w=1000&quot; /&gt;Constantan wire wrapped in spirals around the objective body. Semi-transparent Kapton tape used for insulation makes the wires barely visible on this picture.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To measure the temperature below the objective, we needed a sensor as small as possible. A typical thermometer head would simply not fit into the space between objective and brain surface. We decided to use a thermistor or RTD (resistance temperature detectors). How can we read out the resistance and convert it into temperature? Fortunately, Martin found an old heating block which contained a temperature controller (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.watlow.com/-/media/documents/user-manuals/series-965-eng-c.ashx&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;). These controllers are typically capable to use information from standardized  thermistors of different kinds or thermocouples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we bought the sensor itself, a PT100 thermistor (I think it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn-reichelt.de/documents/datenblatt/B400/M310_EN.pdf&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) with a very small spatial footprint. The connection from the PT100 to the temperature controller is pretty straightforward once you understand the connection scheme based on three wires (&lt;a href=&quot;https://control.com/textbook/continuous-temperature-measurement/thermistors-and-resistance-temperature-detectors-rtds/&quot;&gt;explained here&lt;/a&gt;). This three-wire scheme serves to eliminate the effect of the electrical resistance of the cables on the measurement. Then, we dipped the head of the PT100 into non-corrosive hot glue in order to prevent a shortcut of the PT100 resistor once it dips into the immersion medium. The immersion medium is at least partially conductive and would therefore affect the measure resistance and also the measured temperature. Once we had everything set up, we checked the functionality of the sensor in a water bath, using a standard thermometer for calibration. Another way to perform this calibration would be an ice bath, which is stably at 0°C. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6796&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6796&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;thermosensor&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1000,666&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/thermosensor/&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg?w=1000&quot; /&gt;A repurposed heating block to read out a thermistor. We first looked up the data sheet of the built-in controller (bottom right) and then connected a PT100 thermosensor to its inputs. The PT100 sensor is located at the tiny end of the blue cable (inset), covered by a thin film of non-corrosive hot glue.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The contact surface of my objective with the immersion medium is mostly glass and a bit of plastic, therefore it took roughly 30-60 min until the temperature below the objective reached a stable value of around 37°C. In order to prevent that the heat is distributed throughout the whole microscope, we used a plastic objective holder that does not conduct heat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, I found this small project very instructive. First, I was surprised to learn how reliable and fast an objective heater based on simple resistive wire can be. Heating up the metal part of the objective up to &amp;gt;60°C within minutes was no problem. It took however much longer until the non-metal parts of the objective also reached the desired temperature. I was also glad to see that the objective (16x Nikon) was not damaged and its resolution during imaging was not affected by its increased temperature! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem of designing a very small temperature sensor was more complicated, also due to the standard three-wire scheme to measure with thermistors. However, all components that we used were relatively cheap, and I think that these temperature measurement devices are interesting tools that could be used also for other experiments, e.g., to monitor body temperature or to build custom-made temperature controllers of water bath temperature for slice experiments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
