&lt;p&gt;“Harnessing the ‘base’ motive of material self-interest to promote the common good is perhaps the most important social invention mankind has yet achieved,” said the American economist Charles Schultz. And you can see why. While acknowledging its problems, many &lt;a href=&quot;https://unherd.com/2017/07/ctrl-alt-del-conservatives-must-reboot-capitalism/&quot;&gt;credit free market capitalism for the dramatic reduction over recent decades in the proportion of people in the world living in extreme poverty&lt;/a&gt;, not to mention rising health standards and technological advances. Conversely, according to some commentators, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/01/venezuela-collapsing-socialist-induced-chaos-yet-remains-corbynista/&quot;&gt;one only has to look to modern-day Venezuela to see the dangers of extreme anti-profit socialism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-31434-001&quot;&gt;a new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, most of us have an instinctual anti-profit bias. We view for-profit companies and industries – upon which capitalism is based – with inherent distrust, assuming that the more profitable they are, the more harm they do to society. In fact, research shows the opposite is true: &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0170840603024003910&quot;&gt;companies that make greater profits actually tend to contribute more value to society, for example in terms of their environmental responsibility and corporate philanthropy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the new paper, led by Amit Bhattacharjee at Erasmus University, believe this anti-profit bias leads many voters and politicians to endorse anti-profit policies that are likely to lead to the very opposite outcomes for society that they want to achieve. “Erroneous anti-profit beliefs may lead to systematically worse economic policies for society, even as they help people satisfy their social and expressive needs on an individual level”, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27924&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through seven separate studies involving hundreds of online participants, the researchers present evidence that the anti-profit bias arises because we think about for-profit motives in a somewhat superficial, ego-centric fashion. Because the desire for profit is seen as based on selfish intent, we extrapolate to assume that the activities of for-profit companies and industries must be bad for society, disregarding the reality that selfish intents can have positive consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also refer to our own mundane “zero sum” experiences, such as buying a car, in which the seller’s profitable gain inevitable comes at our loss. We fail to consider how market forces operate on a massive scale, in which for-profit companies (competing in a free market with informed customers) need to innovate, behave fairly and develop a good reputation in order to be profitable over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the first study, participants rated Fortune 500 companies in terms of how profitable they thought they were and how much they thought they engaged in bad business practices, such as operating at the expense of others with no concern for society. There was a clear pattern: the more profitable participants thought a company was, the more they assumed that it engaged in more bad business practices. In fact expert assessments of the firms shows the opposite pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another study, participants were presented with vignettes of different companies and either told they operated for-profit or not-for-profit. Participants rated the exact same companies, engaging in the same business activities, as more likely to cause social harm, and less likely to bring social benefit, if they were described as for-profit rather than not-for-profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharjee and his team found that they could attenuate their participants’ anti-profit bias if they prompted them to think about how a long-term profit motive could encourage greater product innovation and quality, better treatment of staff, and more concern for reputation. However, thinking this way doesn’t seem to come naturally. Participants’ baseline judgments about for-profit companies were the same as when they were actively encouraged to assume that customers face few choices and have no information about firms’ reputations (which isn’t the case in a free market, profit-driven economy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings of an ingrained anti-profit bias generally held regardless of participants’ economic knowledge or political leanings. This was a US study so it remains to be seen if the same anti-profit bias will be found in other cultures. However, as the researchers point out, their participants “live in one of the most market-oriented societies in human history”, and yet “even as they experience the benefits of market exchange, people express little faith in the power of markets to create and reward value for society.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/BMCWordle-620x342-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4594-z&quot;&gt;Food hypersensitivity and eating out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food hypersensitivity (FH) encompasses both food allergies and non-allergic hypersensitivities and the key to minimizing symptoms and adverse health outcomes is avoidance of the food/allergen. As a parent, getting your child to eat the right food is challenging enough, but add the complexity of a FH and it becomes a whole lot harder; managing a FH child’s dietary needs is particularly challenging when eating out. A study &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4594-z&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; explored the experiences and behaviours of parents/caregivers when eating out with their FH child. Responses of the participants focused on three themes: ‘family context’, ‘child-focused concerns’, and ‘venue issues’. Eating out as a family was viewed as important to many of the participants; however the challenges associated with ensuring a safe eating out experience for their FH child meant that compromises were often made by at least one family member in order to provide a ‘safer’ venue for the child. Children were often frustrated/disappointed by limited food choices and caregivers believed that their child was ‘missing out’. This qualitative study provides insights into the experiences of caregivers of children with FH when they eat out, and may be of use in tailoring support and information provision to meet the needs of caregivers and children when eating out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Neurology: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12883-017-0921-3&quot;&gt;Neurological symptom assessment in Wilson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilson’s disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder which leads to impaired copper metabolism; pathological build-up of copper occurs mainly in the liver and the brain which results in liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Early diagnosis of WD is critical to improving treatment outcomes, but remains a challenge due to the plethora of symptoms with which patients may present, as well as the complexity of the existing clinical tools. A study &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12883-017-0921-3&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Neurology &lt;/em&gt;directly compared the two currently used clinical rating scales, in 65 patients receiving treatment for WD, and evaluated their feasibility for use in routine clinical practice. The neurological and psychiatric subscales of the two tools were found to be valuable for detailed assessment of neurological and psychiatric impairment in patients with WD. In contrast, the hepatic subscales showed low correlation with other established measures, underlining the need for further assessment of liver specific rating scales in WD. The authors also developed a short, patient reported, version of one of the scales and suggest its use as a pre-screening tool for the evaluation of WD patients with mild to moderate neurological symptoms, however further studies are required to fully evaluate this scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image of the month:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmczool.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40850-017-0018-x&quot;&gt;3D visualization of live insects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live imaging of whole invertebrates is possible using X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), but image quality is often compromised by the movement of live subjects. A study &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmczool.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40850-017-0018-x&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Zoology&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates that temporary immobilization of live insects, using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas, during micro-CT imaging allows 3D visualization of the whole insect without motion artefacts, and enables repeat imaging at multiple time points, without adversely affecting the insects. The authors discuss the article further in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/07/31/non-destructive-3d-visualization-whole-body-live-insects-2/&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a type of anxiety disorder which may develop after an individual experiences a traumatic event. Approximately 20% of children will experience some kind of traumatic event before they are 16 years old, but only some go on to develop PTSD. How can we know which child is at risk for PTSD so that it can be prevented? A study &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1384-1&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; is the first of its kind to use machine learning to identify risk factors for childhood PTSD; Machine learning is a computational approach designed to find patterns in data that will form reliable and accurate predictive models of specified events (in the case of this study, the occurrence of PTSD in a traumatized child). The study used data from a longitudinal study of children admitted to hospital following an injury; a wide variety of risk factors were assessed whilst the child was in hospital and PTSD was determined three months after hospital discharge. Machine Learning methods were applied to the data and models of risk for PTSD were built and tested for accuracy against the real life incidence of PTSD. A set of causal variables, measured around the time of trauma that predicted PTSD three months later were identified by the models. Author Glenn Saxe tells us more about the study in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/07/10/machine-learning-predict-childhood-ptsd/&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpharmacoltoxicol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40360-017-0163-4&quot;&gt;Targeting angiogenesis in oral cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels, is a vital physiological process in growth and development. Angiogenesis is also critical for growth and malignancy of tumors and inhibitors of angiogenesis are promising therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Semaphorins are secreted proteins that act as axon guidance molecules during the development of the nervous system, but have recently been shown to prevent angiogenesis. A study &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpharmacoltoxicol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40360-017-0163-4&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology &lt;/em&gt;examined the potential therapeutic effects of overexpressing Semaforin-3 (Sema3), which is normally expressed at low levels in human oral cancer. Using a lentiviral vector, the authors overexpressed Sema3 in oral tumor cell lines; they demonstrate decreased tumor vasculature &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and drastically suppressed size and capillary density of tumors in xenograft models of oral cancer &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, overexpression of Sema3A in oral cancer cells drastically suppresses the growth of oral cancer by inhibiting angiogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Genetics:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenet.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12863-017-0535-1&quot;&gt;Tellin shell karyotypes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tellins are a genus of marine bivalve molluscs and are one of the largest and most diverse families of bivalves. The taxonomy of tellins is chaotic, largely due to the diversity displayed by their shells. A study &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenet.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12863-017-0535-1&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Genetics&lt;/em&gt; reports a cytogenetic analysis of four tellin shell species. The authors analyzed the karyotypes (the number and appearance of chromosomes in the nucleus) of the four species, and mapped gene clusters using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The study demonstrates that tellin shells present diverse karyotype compositions. This technique of molecular karyotype analysis provides valuable information for tellin shell identification, and may be helpful for both taxonomic and phylogenetic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Post-publication peer review isn’t just for scientists. Newspaper reporters can help correct the scientific record, too. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has corrected a journal article on Legionnaire’s disease after the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette revealed what seems to be efforts by the researchers to misrepresent their data. In a series of articles […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1750, Benjamin Franklin wrote: “There are three things extremely hard: steel, a diamond, and to know one’s self.” Since then, plenty of research has proven him right: we’re not much good at knowing ourselves and, sadly, we’re &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721411402478&quot;&gt;especially bad when it comes to judging traits in ourselves that we care about the most&lt;/a&gt;. Now Stefan Leach and Mario Weick at the University of Kent, Canterbury, have added to this sorry picture of human delusion, reporting in &lt;i&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/i&gt; that people who believe they’re intuitive are &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550617706732&quot;&gt;no better than anyone else at tasks that require intuition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27900&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leach and Weick recruited 178 students who completed the Preference for Intuition Scale (which asks respondents to indicate how much they agree or disagree with statements like “With most decisions, it makes sense to completely rely on your feelings”). Some also completed the Faith in Intuition Scale (which includes statements such as “I believe in trusting my hunches”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the participants completed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_grammar_learning&quot;&gt;a task&lt;/a&gt; that involved copying out several non-sensical strings of between two and four letters. Unbeknown to the participants, there were complex rules that determined the ordering of these letter strings. After this, they were told that the strings all adhered to hidden grammatical rules and their next challenge was to use their “gut feelings” to decide whether new strings of letters adhered to the rules or not (in these kinds of tasks, implicit learning is thought to manifest consciously as “vague feelings” – intuitions – about what’s going on, though the individual can’t express what their new knowledge actually is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making their judgments, the participants answered questions designed to probe their confidence in their intuitions, how well they thought they did on the task, how much effort they put in, and the extent to which they felt they relied on intuition to decide if a sequence of letters was “correct” or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leach and Weick also ran another study, involving 222 people, which used rules governing the ordering of pictures of people rather than letters. These volunteers also completed a scale exploring their belief in the importance of intuition and their self-rated intuitive abilities before the task, and they answered post-test questions about how well they thought they’d done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis of all this new data, as well as some data collected previously, showed that whether a participant considered him or herself to be intuitive or not had no bearing on their performance at judging the letter strings, or their grasp of the rules. When the participants were asked specifically about how confident they were that their particular intuitions regarding this task were accurate, a positive relationship with performance did emerge – but it was very weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have found that people who consider themselves to be more intuitive also tend to believe that their intuitions &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-05479-007&quot;&gt;lead to good results&lt;/a&gt;, and are useful. So these new findings are likely to come as bad news to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One caveat is that this research involved participants using their intuition to make judgments based on recently acquired knowledge. As the authors themselves stress, “the findings … should not be generalised to other facets of intuition, such as the intuitive decision-making of experts.” However, they added that, “it is interesting to note….that studies on expert intuitions often arrive at similar conclusions as the present research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550617706732&quot;&gt;Can People Judge the Veracity of Their Intuitions?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When young kids play together there’s often a lot of negotiation involved: “That’s my bunny”, “No, it’s mine”, “OK, you have it”. There’s talk of emotion: “Why are you crying?”, “You took my bunny”. And role-play: “You be baddie”, “No, I’m super-bunny”. Perhaps it shouldn’t be too surprising then that &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12682/abstract&quot;&gt;a recent meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that young kids, aged 3 to 7, with more siblings have superior Theory of Mind (understanding other people’s mental states and perspectives – an important ability that benefits social and academic performance at school).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Cognition and Development&lt;/em&gt; asks whether the sibling advantage begins as early as toddlerhood, and whether it matters if a toddler’s sibling is older or younger. In fact, against expectations, toddlers with an older sibling showed no Theory of Mind advantage compared with only children, and toddlers with a younger sibling actually performed worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27774&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Élizabel Leblanc and her colleagues tested 227 two-year-olds (113 boys) on two age-appropriate Theory of Mind tasks. One was focused on perspective-taking and required the toddlers to show their mother a toy and in the process deal with various challenges, such the fact she had her eyes closed or was facing the wrong way. The other task pertained to diverging interests: the toddlers had to choose a book to give the researcher, either a children’s book for which she’d previously expressed dislike or an adult book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, the 112 kids with one or more older siblings and the 76 only children performed equally well at the two tasks. Number of older siblings made no difference to these results. Meanwhile, the 29 toddlers with a younger sibling (but no older siblings) performed worse at the perspective taking task than both only children and toddlers with an older sibling; they also performed worse at the divergent interests task than the kids with older sibs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, the researchers speculated, toddlers with a younger sibling are disadvantaged by their parents’ attention being diverted to their younger, infant sibling (the toddler also can’t engage in sophisticated play with an infant sibling). On the other hand, maybe toddlers without any siblings are able to match the performance of toddlers with older siblings because of the extra attention they receive from their parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Future studies are required to investigate whether a putative negative effect of younger siblings is robust and apparent in the preschool years, whether it is limited to the toddlerhood period, and whether the mechanisms proposed here are indeed at work,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_1113&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/ocello&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Image of Colon Tumor Cells courtesy of OcellO&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-1113&quot; height=&quot;164&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DfHIVQBTSuCwchUJG6lg_OcellO-cultured-tissue-from-patient-colon-tumour-stem-cells-300x164.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Image of Colon Tumor Stem Cells courtesy of OcellO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If you aren’t exploring the latest cell culture models of human tissue for nonclinical and preclinical testing, you should be. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;That’s the bottom line of today’s Science Exchange service provider roundup — three of the five newest service providers on our platform are experts in developing predictive models. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advances in predictive model systems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/axiogenesis&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Axiogenesis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, based in Germany, develops iPSC-derived models of cardiac tissue, neurons, and other cell types. In late 2016, the company made the news when researchers at the United States FDA published a peer-reviewed study showing that Axiogenesis’s Cor.4U cardiomyocyte model was the most predictive model in cardiac safety tests. Last month, researchers at Wake Forest University used the Cor.4U model to develop a digitally trackable beating-heart biosensor. The future of cardiac safety clearly lies beyond hERG channel electrophysiology!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Generating tissue models with precise spatial resolution is possible using 3D bioprinting, in which &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tracking.cirrusinsight.com/466e66be-1ba2-4d51-a499-22dc4af918de/scienceexchange-com-labs-cypre-inc&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Cypre Biotech&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; is an expert. Based in San Francisco, USA, the company focuses on customizing the extracellular matrix of tumor microenvironment models to match certain cancer subtypes. Given the impact of new cancer drugs, including certain immunotherapies, on the tumor microenvironment, technologies such as that developed by Cypre are going to be needed for testing safety and efficacy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The third service provider in this roundup excelling in the development of clinically relevant microtissue models is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/ocello&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;OcellO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, headquartered in the Netherlands. Researchers at OcellO have published numerous peer-reviewed studies showing how combining three-dimensional tissue culture with high-throughput imaging can enable efficient, automated screening and phenotypic profiling. Their most recent publication showed that phenotypic screening of kinase inhibitors could reveal potential new targets for polycystic kidney disease (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/ocello/storefront&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;view abstract in the Resources section of the OcellO storefront&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analytical methods for translational research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As model systems advance in complexity and throughput, analytical methods must keep pace. Two service providers new on Science Exchange are known for their expertise in developing reliable analytical methods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/pangaea-oncology-sa&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Pangaea Oncology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; is one of the most prestigious laboratories in the world in the fields of molecular diagnostics, pathology, and related analysis services for translational research. We are thrilled to have the Pangaea team, led by expert Dr. Rafael Rosell and Nobel laureate Dr. Santiago Ramón y Cajal, join the Science Exchange platform! Pangaea Oncology was the first laboratory in Spain to be accredited to perform certain genetic tests for cancer in serum/plasma samples, advancing precision medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We also bring you &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/metis-laboratories&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Metis Laboratories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, whose analytical expertise centers on radiotracer-based assays. These assays remain one of the most sensitive and specific platforms for assessing ligand binding and compound distribution; however, complex handling requirements mean that outsourcing these studies is far more practical than developing radiotracer assays in house. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scienceexchange.com&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Connect with a new provider today!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://romainbrette.fr/project-binaural-cues-and-spatial-hearing-in-ecological-environments/"/>
		<id>http://romainbrette.fr/?p=1441</id>
		<updated>2017-08-02T07:27:32+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="fr-FR">
 &lt;p&gt;I previously laid out a few ideas for future research on spatial hearing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/some-propositions-for-future-spatial-hearing-research-i-the-ecological-situation-and-the-computational-problem/&quot;&gt;The ecological situation and the computational problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/some-propositions-for-future-spatial-hearing-research-ii-tuning-curves/&quot;&gt;Tuning curves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/some-propositions-for-future-spatial-hearing-research-iii-the-coding-problem/&quot;&gt;The coding problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I wrote a grant that addresses the first point. My project was rather straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make binaural recordings with ear mics in real environments, with real sound sources (actual sounding objects) placed at predetermined positions. This way we obtain distributions of binaural cues conditioned on source direction, capturing the variability due to context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To measure human localization performance in those situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To try to see if a Bayesian model can account for these results, and possibly previous psychophysical results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was preselected but unfortunately not funded. I probably won't resubmit it next year, except perhaps with a collaboration. So here it is for everyone to read: my grant application, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/WordPress3/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Binaural-Hearing-Grant.pdf&quot;&gt;Binaural cues and spatial hearing in ecological environments&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. If you like it, if you want to do these recordings and experiments, please do so. I am interested in the results, but I'm happy if someone else does it. Please contact me if you would like to set up a collaboration, or discuss the project. I am especially interested in the theoretical analysis (ie the third part of the project). Our experience in the lab is primarily on the theoretical side, but also in signal analysis, and we have done a number of binaural recordings too and some psychophysics.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/oqjnoREBaok/nature23671"/>
		<id>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature23671</id>
		<updated>2017-08-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;
 ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers regulate access to genetic information by controlling nucleosome positions in vivo1. However, the mechanism by which remodelers discriminate between different nucleosome substrates is poorly understood. Considering that many chromatin remodeling proteins possess conserved protein domains that interact with nucleosomal features2, we employed a quantitative high-throughput approach, based on the use of a DNA-barcoded mononucleosome library, to profile the biochemical activity of human ISWI remodelers in response to a diverse set of nucleosome modifications. We show that accessory (non-ATPase) subunits of ISWI remodelers can distinguish between differentially modified nucleosomes, directing remodeling activity toward specific nucleosome substrates based on their modification state. Unexpectedly, we discover the nucleosome acidic patch3 as necessary for maximum activity of all ISWI remodelers evaluated. We find this dependence also extends to CHD and SWI/SNF family remodelers, suggesting the acidic patch may be generally required for chromatin remodeling. Critically, we observe that remodeling activity can be regulated by modifications neighboring the acidic patch, signifying it may act as a tunable interaction hotspot for ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers and, by extension, many other chromatin effectors that engage this region of the nucleosome surface4–9.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Metabolism has been shown to integrate with epigenetics and transcription to modulate cell fate and function. Beyond meeting the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands of T-cell differentiation, whether metabolism might control T-cell fate by an epigenetic mechanism is unclear. Here, through the discovery and mechanistic characterization of a small molecule, (aminooxy)acetic acid, that reprograms the differentiation of T helper 17 (TH17) cells towards induced regulatory T (iTreg) cells, we show that increased transamination, mainly catalysed by GOT1, leads to increased levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate in differentiating TH17 cells. The accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate resulted in hypermethylation of the Foxp3 gene locus and inhibited Foxp3 transcription, which is essential for fate determination towards TH17 cells. Inhibition of the conversion of glutamate to α-ketoglutaric acid prevented the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate, reduced methylation of the Foxp3 gene locus, and increased Foxp3 expression. This consequently blocked the differentiation of TH17 cells by antagonizing the function of transcription factor RORγt and promoted polarization into iTreg cells. Selective inhibition of GOT1 with (aminooxy)acetic acid ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in a therapeutic mouse model by regulating the balance between TH17 and iTreg cells. Targeting a glutamate-dependent metabolic pathway thus represents a new strategy for developing therapeutic agents against TH17-mediated autoimmune diseases.

 The self-association of proteins into symmetric complexes is ubiquitous in all kingdoms of life. Symmetric complexes possess unique geometric and functional properties, but their internal symmetry can pose a risk. In sickle-cell disease, the symmetry of haemoglobin exacerbates the effect of a mutation, triggering assembly into harmful fibrils. Here we examine the universality of this mechanism and its relation to protein structure geometry. We introduced point mutations solely designed to increase surface hydrophobicity among 12 distinct symmetric complexes from Escherichia coli. Notably, all responded by forming supramolecular assemblies in vitro, as well as in vivo upon heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Remarkably, in four cases, micrometre-long fibrils formed in vivo in response to a single point mutation. Biophysical measurements and electron microscopy revealed that mutants self-assembled in their folded states and so were not amyloid-like. Structural examination of 73 mutants identified supramolecular assembly hot spots predictable by geometry. A subsequent structural analysis of 7,471 symmetric complexes showed that geometric hot spots were buffered chemically by hydrophilic residues, suggesting a mechanism preventing mis-assembly of these regions. Thus, point mutations can frequently trigger folded proteins to self-assemble into higher-order structures. This potential is counterbalanced by negative selection and can be exploited to design nanomaterials in living cells.

 The origins of the Bronze Age Minoan and Mycenaean cultures have puzzled archaeologists for more than a century. We have assembled genome-wide data from 19 ancient individuals, including Minoans from Crete, Mycenaeans from mainland Greece, and their eastern neighbours from southwestern Anatolia. Here we show that Minoans and Mycenaeans were genetically similar, having at least three-quarters of their ancestry from the first Neolithic farmers of western Anatolia and the Aegean, and most of the remainder from ancient populations related to those of the Caucasus and Iran. However, the Mycenaeans differed from Minoans in deriving additional ancestry from an ultimate source related to the hunter–gatherers of eastern Europe and Siberia, introduced via a proximal source related to the inhabitants of either the Eurasian steppe or Armenia. Modern Greeks resemble the Mycenaeans, but with some additional dilution of the Early Neolithic ancestry. Our results support the idea of continuity but not isolation in the history of populations of the Aegean, before and after the time of its earliest civilizations.

 Anthrax is a globally important animal disease and zoonosis. Despite this, our current knowledge of anthrax ecology is largely limited to arid ecosystems, where outbreaks are most commonly reported. Here we show that the dynamics of an anthrax-causing agent, Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis, in a tropical rainforest have severe consequences for local wildlife communities. Using data and samples collected over three decades, we show that rainforest anthrax is a persistent and widespread cause of death for a broad range of mammalian hosts. We predict that this pathogen will accelerate the decline and possibly result in the extirpation of local chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) populations. We present the epidemiology of a cryptic pathogen and show that its presence has important implications for conservation.

 Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths. Although The Cancer Genome Atlas has sequenced primary tumour types obtained from surgical resections, much less comprehensive molecular analysis is available from clinically acquired metastatic cancers. Here we perform whole-exome and -transcriptome sequencing of 500 adult patients with metastatic solid tumours of diverse lineage and biopsy site. The most prevalent genes somatically altered in metastatic cancer included TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, PIK3CA, and RB1. Putative pathogenic germline variants were present in 12.2% of cases of which 75% were related to defects in DNA repair. RNA sequencing complemented DNA sequencing to identify gene fusions, pathway activation, and immune profiling. Our results show that integrative sequence analysis provides a clinically relevant, multi-dimensional view of the complex molecular landscape and microenvironment of metastatic cancers.

 Genome editing has potential for the targeted correction of germline mutations. Here we describe the correction of the heterozygous MYBPC3 mutation in human preimplantation embryos with precise CRISPR–Cas9-based targeting accuracy and high homology-directed repair efficiency by activating an endogenous, germline-specific DNA repair response. Induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) at the mutant paternal allele were predominantly repaired using the homologous wild-type maternal gene instead of a synthetic DNA template. By modulating the cell cycle stage at which the DSB was induced, we were able to avoid mosaicism in cleaving embryos and achieve a high yield of homozygous embryos carrying the wild-type MYBPC3 gene without evidence of off-target mutations. The efficiency, accuracy and safety of the approach presented suggest that it has potential to be used for the correction of heritable mutations in human embryos by complementing preimplantation genetic diagnosis. However, much remains to be considered before clinical applications, including the reproducibility of the technique with other heterozygous mutations.

 Cells in healthy tissues acquire mutations with surprising frequency. Many of these mutations are associated with abnormal cellular behaviours such as differentiation defects and hyperproliferation, yet fail to produce macroscopically detectable phenotypes. It is currently unclear how the tissue remains phenotypically normal, despite the presence of these mutant cells. Here we use intravital imaging to track the fate of mouse skin epithelium burdened with varying numbers of activated Wnt/β-catenin stem cells. We show that all resulting growths that deform the skin tissue architecture regress, irrespective of their size. Wild-type cells are required for the active elimination of mutant cells from the tissue, while utilizing both endogenous and ectopic cellular behaviours to dismantle the aberrant structures. After regression, the remaining structures are either completely eliminated or converted into functional skin appendages in a niche-dependent manner. Furthermore, tissue aberrancies generated from oncogenic Hras, and even mutation-independent deformations to the tissue, can also be corrected, indicating that this tolerance phenomenon reflects a conserved principle in the skin. This study reveals an unanticipated plasticity of the adult skin epithelium when faced with mutational and non-mutational insult, and elucidates the dynamic cellular behaviours used for its return to a homeostatic state.

 &lt;p&gt;
 The initiating oncogenic event in almost half of human lung adenocarcinomas is still unknown, a fact that complicates the development of selective targeted therapies. Yet these tumours harbour a number of alterations without obvious oncogenic function including BRAF-inactivating mutations. Inactivating BRAF mutants in lung predominate over the activating V600E mutant that is frequently observed in other tumour types. Here we demonstrate that the expression of an endogenous Braf(D631A) kinase-inactive isoform in mice (corresponding to the human BRAF(D594A) mutation) triggers lung adenocarcinoma in vivo, indicating that BRAF-inactivating mutations are initiating events in lung oncogenesis. Moreover, inactivating BRAF mutations have also been identified in a subset of KRAS-driven human lung tumours. Co-expression of Kras(G12V) and Braf(D631A) in mouse lung cells markedly enhances tumour initiation, a phenomenon mediated by Craf kinase activity, and effectively accelerates tumour progression when activated in advanced lung adenocarcinomas. We also report a key role for the wild-type Braf kinase in sustaining Kras(G12V)/Braf(D631A)-driven tumours. Ablation of the wild-type Braf allele prevents the development of lung adenocarcinoma by inducing a further increase in MAPK signalling that results in oncogenic toxicity; this effect can be abolished by pharmacological inhibition of Mek to restore tumour growth. However, the loss of wild-type Braf also induces transdifferentiation of club cells, which leads to the rapid development of lethal intrabronchiolar lesions. These observations indicate that the signal intensity of the MAPK pathway is a critical determinant not only in tumour development, but also in dictating the nature of the cancer-initiating cell and ultimately the resulting tumour phenotype.

 &lt;p&gt;
 The human body carries vast communities of microbes that provide many benefits. Our microbiome is complex and challenging to understand, but evolutionary theory provides a universal framework with which to analyse its biology and health impacts. Here we argue that to understand a given microbiome feature, such as colonization resistance, host nutrition or immune development, we must consider how hosts and symbionts evolve. Symbionts commonly evolve to compete within the host ecosystem, while hosts evolve to keep the ecosystem on a leash. We suggest that the health benefits of the microbiome should be understood, and studied, as an interplay between microbial competition and host control.

		<link href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/96XXZyzl7Do/nature23291"/>

 &lt;p&gt;
 Approximately 200 BRAF mutant alleles have been identified in human tumours. Activating BRAF mutants cause feedback inhibition of GTP-bound RAS, are RAS-independent and signal either as active monomers (class 1) or constitutively active dimers (class 2). Here we characterize a third class of BRAF mutants—those that have impaired kinase activity or are kinase-dead. These mutants are sensitive to ERK-mediated feedback and their activation of signalling is RAS-dependent. The mutants bind more tightly than wild-type BRAF to RAS–GTP, and their binding to and activation of wild-type CRAF is enhanced, leading to increased ERK signalling. The model suggests that dysregulation of signalling by these mutants in tumours requires coexistent mechanisms for maintaining RAS activation despite ERK-dependent feedback. Consistent with this hypothesis, melanomas with these class 3 BRAF mutations also harbour RAS mutations or NF1 deletions. By contrast, in lung and colorectal cancers with class 3 BRAF mutants, RAS is typically activated by receptor tyrosine kinase signalling. These tumours are sensitive to the inhibition of RAS activation by inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases. We have thus defined three distinct functional classes of BRAF mutants in human tumours. The mutants activate ERK signalling by different mechanisms that dictate their sensitivity to therapeutic inhibitors of the pathway.

		<link href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/-fVMdE-EPXc/nature23288"/>

 &lt;p&gt;
 Pollinators are declining worldwide and this has raised concerns for a parallel decline in the essential pollination service they provide to both crops and wild plants. Anthropogenic drivers linked to this decline include habitat changes, intensive agriculture, pesticides, invasive alien species, spread of pathogens and climate change. Recently, the rapid global increase in artificial light at night has been proposed to be a new threat to terrestrial ecosystems; the consequences of this increase for ecosystem function are mostly unknown. Here we show that artificial light at night disrupts nocturnal pollination networks and has negative consequences for plant reproductive success. In artificially illuminated plant–pollinator communities, nocturnal visits to plants were reduced by 62% compared to dark areas. Notably, this resulted in an overall 13% reduction in fruit set of a focal plant even though the plant also received numerous visits by diurnal pollinators. Furthermore, by merging diurnal and nocturnal pollination sub-networks, we show that the structure of these combined networks tends to facilitate the spread of the negative consequences of disrupted nocturnal pollination to daytime pollinator communities. Our findings demonstrate that artificial light at night is a threat to pollination and that the negative effects of artificial light at night on nocturnal pollination are predicted to propagate to the diurnal community, thereby aggravating the decline of the diurnal community. We provide perspectives on the functioning of plant–pollinator communities, showing that nocturnal pollinators are not redundant to diurnal communities and increasing our understanding of the human-induced decline in pollinators and their ecosystem service.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/normandy-1982417_960_720-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lentils are an important part of our diet  worldwide. As reported by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/home/en/&quot;&gt;FAOSTAT&lt;/a&gt;, in 2013 the global production of lentils was 4,975,621 metric tons. This food source is known to grow in the cold season in temperate semi-arid parts of the world, spanning North America to Australia. Though, some breeds are unable to survive the frosts of winter, causing concern for agriculturalists attempting to grow these crops in high latitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been an increasing need to cultivate lentils which are able to grow in cold settings. This global demand is being addressed in a recent study led by researchers from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unileon.es/estudiantes/estudiantes-doctorado/rd992011/programas/biologia-molecular-y-biotecnologia&quot;&gt;Departamento de Biología Molecular- Universidad de León&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agriculturaganaderia.jcyl.es/&quot;&gt;Agricultura y Ganadería&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inea.org/&quot;&gt;Escuela Universitaria de Ingeniería Agrícola&lt;/a&gt; in Spain and at &lt;a href=&quot;http://genxpro.net/&quot;&gt;GenXpro&lt;/a&gt; in Germany. The scientists are investigating the gene sequences that are responsible for cold tolerance in lentils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants which can tolerate low temperatures have developed biological adaptions to increase their resilience to the cold. This includes the alteration of their cell membranes, photosynthesis processes, and their gene expression. Of particular interest, are the sets of genes responsible for the tolerance that certain lentil breeds have towards cold and frost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9336 alignright&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/chana-390529_960_720-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncovering the regulatory proteins that govern this tolerance is important, as these represent ‘transcription factors’ which micro-manage which genes are turned on or off. Stressful settings such as the frost resulting from low temperatures can induce changes in how genes are managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this recently published study, Dr Barrios and the team set out to observe the changing gene expression of lentils in response to cold acclimation. Their aim was to find out which lentil breeds could be considered ‘cold tolerant’ or ‘cold susceptible’ depending on the responses to varying temperatures ranging from -3degC to -15degC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At low temperatures, almost all plants survived with minimum leaf damage. Though, as the temperature was lowered further, the plants showed increasingly different degrees of damage. Leaves with the highest and lowest amounts of damage were analyzed using Deep Super-SAG transcriptome technology in order to extract their messenger RNA sequences. These sequences act as ‘messengers’ across the molecular network, translating genetic information from DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plants that were less cold tolerant were named “acclimated susceptible”, while those that were better adapted were “acclimated tolerant”. For full comparison, these were compared against non-acclimatized (non-adapted) versions of the cold susceptible and tolerant types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed that the plants that were more acclimated to the cold tended to have an over expression (enhanced activity) of particular gene sets. These were the genes responsible for the production of the amino acids glycine and proline, the maintenance of the plant cell membrane, and the genes that manage photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By finding that these particular gene sets play a key role for the adaption to cold temperatures, this provides opportunistic groundwork for further investigation of the frost tolerance of lentils. Future research may benefit the agricultural industry by helping to boost crop yields in high latitudes of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How far has evolutionary thinking permeated through academia? A survey of more than 600 scholars from 22 disciplines, ranging from psychology and economics through to gender studies, sociology and the humanities, finds that there remain two distinct cultures in the academe, at least regarding views on the principal causes of human behaviour and human culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group, made up of psychologists, economists, philosophers and political scientists believes more strongly in the genetic influences on behaviour, beliefs and culture. The other group, consisting sociologists, non-evolutionary anthropologists, women’s and gender studies scholars and all humanities scholars (except philosophy), believes in the primacy of environmental influences. What’s more, those scholars favouring environmental accounts also tend to be sceptical of the scientific method. The findings are &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.academicstudiespress.com/index.php/ESIC/article/view/10&quot;&gt;published open-access&lt;/a&gt; in the newly launched journal &lt;i&gt;Evolutionary Studies in Imaginative Culture.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27693&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Carroll at the University of Missouri–St. Louis and his colleagues, including Mathias Clasen at Aarhus University, identified influential scholars in different disciplines based on their authorship of papers in their fields’ leading journals. Each participant rated their agreement with 24 statements pertaining to the nature/nurture debate and gene-environment interactions. The camp favouring genetic explanations tended to agree more strongly with statements like “Human behaviour is produced predominantly or exclusively by genetically transmitted characteristics”. The other camp rated more strongly items like “Human behaviour is produced predominantly or exclusively by environmental conditions, including cultural conventions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A glimmer of hope for future consensus was found in the fact that both camps tended to answer in the affirmative to items pertaining to gene-environment interactions, such as “Human values, beliefs and feelings are produced by an interaction between adaptations shaped by selection and environmental conditions, including cultural conventions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, signs of consensus were somewhat undermined by the participants’ open-ended comments which showed that the two camps had a different perspective on what gene environment interactions mean. For instance, on the topic of gender identity, an evolutionary social sciences scholar said: “I believe gender identity reflects a mixture of genetic and culture inputs, with the genetic being somewhat more important”, while a literary studies scholar said: “I agree that biological characteristics play a role in gender-identity formation but I suppose I absolutely disagree that they do so ‘predominantly'”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most worrying, in the sense of undermining hopes of any future consensus on understanding human behaviour and culture, is that the scholars who favoured environmental and cultural explanations for behaviour also tended to doubt the scientific method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Human behaviour is not subject to immutable laws, and, therefore, can’t be studied scientifically,” said a religious studies scholar. “Scientific knowledge has something to tell us about material artefacts and their production, but ‘human nature’, ‘human experience’ and ‘human behaviour’ are not empirically stable,” said a literary studies scholar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, scholars favouring genetic and evolutionary accounts of behaviour expressed faith in science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carroll and his colleagues said their survey had provided a “statistical snapshot … from a landscape constantly changing” of the diverging views on human nature and culture held by the social sciences and humanities. Their own optimistic feeling is that opinion is moving “unmistakably toward an integrated biocultural view of human behaviour”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, will the gap between the two cultures ever be bridged? The greatest obstacle, the researchers believe, is those scholars who declare that human behaviour cannot be studied scientifically (consider the views of another ethnic studies scholar: “I don’t believe in the genetic evolution of species,” they wrote, “There is an imprint of divinity in each person that ensures our commonalities”). Carroll and his colleagues said “Most researchers who regard human behaviour as beyond the reach of science, or who deny that science has any special claims on the production of knowledge, have more academic respectability that creationists, but they are similar to creationists in that they step willingly outside the circle of knowledge susceptible to empirical falsification.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/high-heels-1327021_640-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social pressures behind shoe choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review highlights the extent to which the shoe choice of some women is influenced by social norms and external pressures, rather than personal choice. The authors cite an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.misterpoll.com/polls/611217/results&quot;&gt;online opinion poll of 270 women&lt;/a&gt;, around one third of whom claimed to wear high heels mainly because of social expectation rather than free choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly the same proportion also claimed to have been required to wear high heels at work. Of course, we can question the accuracy of such a poll (for example, many respondents claimed to have worn heels greater than 20 inches high!), but anecdotal evidence does seem to support the notion of some women being forced to wear high heels in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic has received recent media attention in my native UK, since a complaint was issued by a young woman who was ultimately sent home from work without pay because she refused to wear a pair of high heels that satisfied the company’s dress code (2-4 inches, rather arbitrarily).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“it is the tension between psychosexual benefits and negative musculoskeletal health effects that makes high heels a topic of substantial public health interest”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barnish et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the woman launched a petition to make it illegal for a company to require women to wear high heels at work- which received over 150,000 signatures- the UK government issued an obscure statement that promised to “remove barriers to equality for women at work”, whilst failing to specify any concrete action to overcome the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infamous Cannes Film Festival incident of 2015, in which a group of women were allegedly denied access to a film screening because they were not wearing heels, is just one more example of an outdated and baseless policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to examine such political issues in light of the attitudes of the general public towards high heels because, to use the words of Barnish et al., “it is the tension between psychosexual benefits and negative musculoskeletal health effects that makes high heels a topic of substantial public health interest”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, as noted by Barnish et al., there is now scientific evidence to support the common belief that men perceive women in high heels to be more attractive than those without. The authors also highlight the finding that the women &lt;em&gt;wearing&lt;/em&gt; the heels often feel more attractive than when not wearing them. Whilst these views might not be universal, they do little to force companies and governments to rethink their attitudes and policies around high heels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biomechanical effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the average reader might wonder why I, a biomechanist, should care or even dare to speak of these issues. The answer is simple: as noted by Barnish et al., biomechanical and epidemiological studies conducted over the past few decades strongly suggest that wearing high heels causes widespread negative alterations in the musculoskeletal system, ranging from the spine to the toes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biomechanical and epidemiological studies … strongly suggest that wearing high heels causes widespread negative alterations in the musculoskeletal system, ranging from the spine to the toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, it seems at best ignorant and at worst downright negligent to continue to require women to wear high heels if they don’t want to. After all, I am quite confident that any proposed policy requiring men to wear something uncomfortable for extended periods of time would be met with stern resistance to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Barnish et al. raise another issue, which is possibly even more troubling than the first. At present it is legal to sell high heels to children in many countries. Although not many studies have examined the effects of high heels on the gait and musculoskeletal function of children, the limited published evidence unsurprisingly suggests that these effects are negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increased incidence of high heel wear in recent years in children cited by Barnish et al. is another worrying trend in this light. The authors echo earlier calls to educate school children about the health effects of high heels. The evidence outlined by Barnish et al. suggests that school children are not the only ones who would benefit from such information.&lt;/p&gt;

It turns out there's a bit of a backstory here. According to the senior author of the new paper, Jon Roiser, his group did want to submit to NRN, but they w</content>

&lt;p&gt;While biological differences between the sexes might give men a physical advantage in many sports, it’s possible that they come at a mental cost. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1454958&quot;&gt;Men typically show a greater spike in the stress hormone cortisol when under pressure than women&lt;/a&gt;, and, given that high cortisol levels can interfere with mental processing, it’s feasible this could mean men’s performance is more adversely affected in high-stakes contexts than women’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016748701630589X?_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_origin=gateway&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb&amp;amp;dgcid=raven_sd_via_email#b0110&quot;&gt;new analysis&lt;/a&gt; of elite tennis performance in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Economic Psychology&lt;/em&gt; is consistent with this account. Based on the outcome of thousands of games played across the four tennis Grand Slams in 2010, the researchers led by Danny Cohen-Zada at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, found that men were adversely affected by high pressure by about twice as much as women. Extrapolating to the world of work, Cohen-Zada and his colleagues said this casts doubt on the argument that the gender pay gap is due to women’s inability to compete under pressure, though they acknowledged there are caveats to this conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27575&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers accessed data on scores and players for over 1000 men’s and women’s matches played at Wimbledon, The French Open, The Australian Open and the US Open in 2010. They focused on Grand Slams because they offer the same prize money to men and women competitors, which rules out differences in stakes as an explanation for any observed sex differences in performance under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used various statistical techniques to weight the amount of pressure in any given game (including assessing how important the game was for increasing the odds of winning the match) and they looked to see how this affected the server’s performance compared with how often the server typically wins a game (the server has a big advantage in tennis). The researchers also adjusted the numbers to account for the fact that women play best of three games at Grand Slams whereas man play best of five, meaning that early games are more consequential for women than men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was ample evidence of high pressure adversely affecting male players’ performance. With a given unit increase in pressure (one standard deviation in statistical terms), men’s likelihood of losing a game in which they were serving increased by 4.9 per cent. For women, the same increase in pressure was associated with an increased likelihood of losing their service game of just 2.8  per cent. This apparent sex difference in the effect of pressure held even after factoring out other influences such as fatigue and differences in ranking between competing players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another analysis, the researchers focused on the effect of high pressure when both players had so far won an equal number of games (to help rule out strategic issues such as one player deciding to give up when they were too far behind). The detrimental effects of pressure were little changed for men in this context, but for women there was now no evidence of choking at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our robust evidence that women can respond better than men to competitive pressure is compelling,” the researchers said. “Our results do not seem to support the claim that gender differences in wages in the labor market can be attributed to the fact that women respond more poorly to competitive pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the caveats to this conclusion are the fact that in normal work situations men and women may be competing against each other (for sales targets, for instance), whereas the current results are based on men and women competing separately. In fact, there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-economics-111809-125122&quot;&gt;past research&lt;/a&gt; to suggest that women’s performance under pressure may particularly suffer in mixed-sex competition. Of course, it’s also not clear how far the current findings pertain specifically to elite tennis or whether they reveal something about men and women’s performance more generally.&lt;/p&gt;

Three-dimensional representations of complex structures obtained with different imaging modalities (e.g. X-ray computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) have been especially useful and impressive in vertebrates (including humans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9302&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9302 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;230&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/figure1-300x230.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Schematic of our new set-up summarizing the incorporation of CO2 gas as anesthetic during X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) of live insect imaging.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, imaging whole live invertebrates (e.g. insects) is very challenging. Apart from the acute radiation doses required to obtain the desired image when X-rays modalities are used, movement of the live subjects compromises image quality by producing artefacts. Therefore, research involving invertebrate imaging is usually destructive and requires animal sacrifice, especially in time-course studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To image live insects, it is crucial to fully immobilize the individuals, deliver a sufficiently low radiation dose to allow repeated scans of the same individuals for time-course studies (when X-rays are used), and provide adequate image resolution and quality to distinguish &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; structures. Moreover, the method should have minimal or no subsequent negative effects on life history traits (e.g. growth, reproduction, and longevity) or physiological processes (i.e. normal biological functions) of test subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9303&quot; style=&quot;width: 187px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9303 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/figure2-177x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;177&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;3D-CT reconstruction of a live anesthetized Colorado potato beetle adult female depicting the body exoskeleton and the tracheal system (for O2 and CO2 gas exchange in insects) at 20 μm isotropic voxel spacing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we devised a method using carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas as anesthetic to induce hypoxia (oxygen deficient conditions) that prevents motion artifacts during non-invasive imaging of whole live insects for 3D visualization. With this approach (summarised in Fig. 1), we were able to keep the live insects immobile for a prolonged period (up to 7 hours), and repeatedly scan the same individuals using X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). We also demonstrated that if the correct scan protocol is used those individuals recover with minimal impact on their subsequent behaviour and reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have overcome the technical challenges of live insect imaging by relying on these organisms’ remarkable abilities to survive prolonged hypoxia and ionising radiation doses (at least 100x more than the lethal dose for humans). We successfully employed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas as an anesthetic to provide temporary paralysis to keep the insect fully immobilized during micro-CT scanning (similar to a human CT scan where the patient must remain as still as possible) to provide 3D visualization (Figs. 2 &amp;amp; 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9304&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-9304&quot; height=&quot;623&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/figure3-1024x996.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;3D-CT reconstruction (20 μm resolution) of the whole body showing the internal structures and the tracheal system of a live anesthetized male adult true armyworm at 1 (sexually immature) and 4 (sexually mature) days, demonstrating the feasibility of repeated scanning of the same individual.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we used X-ray micro-CT here, establishing an optimal scanning condition was key due to the unavoidable trade-off in the dose-to-noise relationship (i.e. lower radiation dose = low image quality due to noise, and vice-versa). Our optimised scanning condition produced radiation doses that are at least 80 times less than those used for insect sterilization. Under the optimal condition, insect adults are kept fully immobilized for long enough at relatively low radiation and hypoxic doses from which they can recover rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9305&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9305 size-large&quot; height=&quot;260&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/figure4-1024x416.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;The method has been successfully tested for other insect life stages. 3D-CT reconstruction at 20 μm resolution of live (i) true armyworm pupa, and (ii) hornworm caterpillar.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, we successfully exposed live insects (adults and other life stages; see Fig.4) to CO&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;gas as an anesthetic for whole-body unrestricted immobilization during X-ray micro-CT imaging, with little or no impact on their recovery and behaviour. We believe this new way to visualize live insects can be easily implemented and is compatible with other imaging modalities (e.g. MRI). Within its limitation, this imaging method has various applications in developmental studies (especially in time-course studies) in a range of disciplines such as medical entomology and parasitology.&lt;/p&gt;

 Is a small scientific study better than none at all? A provocative piece in Frontiers in Psychology raises the question of whether we should ever do under-powered studies. The authors are Dutch researchers Rik Crutzen and Gjalt-Jorn Y. Peters.





Crutzen and Peters begin by questioning the idea that even a little evidence is always valuable. Taking the example of a study that only manages to recruit a handful of patients because it's studying a rare disease, the authors say that:

 There are three basic types of human smile: &quot;reward&quot;, &quot;affiliative&quot; and &quot;dominance&quot; smiles. That's according to a new paper by psychologists Magdalena Rychlowska and colleagues.



Here's the authors' illustration of the types, as posed by actors:

Reward smiles, the authors say, are used to signal enjoyment:

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Social behavior is important for our survival as a species. But social interaction also gives pathogens a chance to spread, and it thereby increases our exposure to infection. Our immune system is a complex defense system that has evolved to protect us from infections. Therefore, it makes sense to assume that our immune system must have developed ingenious strategies to protect us from new pathogens to which social interaction has exposed us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Evidence of a link between the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/24/can-our-immune-system-drive-our-social-behavior/&quot;&gt;immune system and our social behavior&lt;/a&gt; has been accumulating in the last years. A direct connection between the brain and the immune system, through lymphatic vessels in the meninges, was recently revealed. Then it was shown that the immune system can directly affect, and even control social behavior and the desire for social interaction – an impaired immunity was shown to induce deficits in social behavior. This sounds like a clever preventive self-defense mechanism designed to avoid contagion – in times of poor immunity, our brain gets the message to reduce social interaction and, consequently, exposure to pathogens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;This is a self-defense mechanism that is activated when our body signals a poor immunological status; it’s an internal chemical communication system. But is there an external threat signaling system? The ability to detect and avoid infected individuals would clearly be a great evolutionary asset in strengthening our protection mechanisms. Many animals can detect sickness via odors, leading to a restraint in social interaction, most likely intended to reduce exposure to disease. Do humans have a similar sensory sickness detection system, something that allows us to detect infectious threat in others?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;To answer this question, a new study aimed at determining whether humans can detect sickness in others from visual and olfactory cues. Sickness was experimentally induced through the injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a molecule found in the membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that provokes robust immune responses. The activation of immune responses leads to an increase in the production of pro-inflammatory molecules that activate sickness responses and behaviors. It is known that visual cues of sickness, such as redness of the skin, allow us to infer the health of others. But although LPS induces a strong sickness response, its observable effects are subtle, and odor cues are difficult to perceive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Photos of the face and samples of body odors of both sick and healthy individuals were presented to a group of naïve participants while their cerebral responses were recorded using fMRI. These participants were not aware that they would be seeing and smelling sick and healthy people. They were asked to focus on the faces while the odors were also presented and rate how much they liked the person. Faces were also rated on attractiveness, health, and desired social interaction, and odors were rated on intensity, pleasantness and health. This allowed the assessment of the “liking behavior” towards the faces, an indication of the will to approach and interact with others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The rating of sick and healthy faces showed that photos obtained during acute sickness were generally considered less attractive, less healthy, and less socially desirable than the faces of participants receiving the placebo treatment. When faces were presented concomitantly with an odor, there was a lower liking of sick than of healthy faces, regardless of the odor presented with the face. Although participants were not able to perceive sickness in the odors, nor did they rate sick odors as more unpleasant or more intense than healthy odors, faces, regardless of being sick or healthy, were also less liked when paired with sick body odor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;These results show that we can detect early and subtle signs of sickness in others from both facial and olfactory cues, even just a couple of hours after activation of their immune system. Moreover, fMRI data revealed that visual and olfactory sickness cues activated their respective visual face processing and olfactory sensory cortices,  as well as multisensory convergence zones. And even though odors were often too weak to be consciously detected, these olfactory sickness cues still led to activation of the olfactory cortex. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The study also revealed that this perception of subtle cues of sickness leads to reduced liking and decreased will for social interaction. This response may represent a human behavioral defense system against disease. The integration of olfactory and visual sickness cues in the brain may be part of a mechanism designed to detect sickness, resulting in behavioral avoidance of sick individuals, and in avoidance of impending threats of infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A journal has retracted a 2012 paper after determining that the authors had already published it elsewhere. According to the retraction notice, the editors-in-chief of the Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology concluded that the article had  been published in another journal—In Vitro Cellular &amp;amp; Developmental Biology – Animal—the previous month.

&lt;p&gt;In most human societies those with a higher social status enjoy privileges beyond the reach of others. Such status can be obtained through dominance, using intimidation or force, or acquiring prestige by demonstrating knowledge and skill. To make best use of the benefits though, other people need to know that you are top dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you’re of a lower status, there are probably times when it pays to avoid challenging those higher up the pecking order. In which case, you might want to convey your recognition of their authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using body language, such as by taking up more space (adopting “power poses”) may be one of the most obvious, visible modes of asserting ourselves. But of course speech also conveys status, not only in its content, but in the characteristics of the voice itself. Indeed, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179407&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;PLOS One&lt;/i&gt; we adjust the pitch of our voice depending on who we are talking to. The research group at the University of Stirling found that the direction of this unconscious vocal tuning depends on the speaker’s perception of their social status relative to the listener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-27550&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juan David Leongómez and his colleagues recorded students as they took part in simulated interviews for a job as an admin assistant with three different male employers (the order of the interviews was varied between participants). A picture and description of each employer showed one to be highly dominant (Chief of Security at a prison, described as tough and intimidating), another highly prestigious (Head of Department at a Business School, described as well-respected and competent), and a third was neutral (from the HR department at a secondary school, described as your average boss).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants had to introduce themselves to the employer, and explain why they were suited to the job. They were also asked about how they would approach their boss if they had a disagreement with a colleague. After all the interviews, the participants filled out a questionnaire about their own and the employers’ dominance and prestige.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the recordings, the researchers calculated the “fundamental frequency” of the participants’ voices (an objective measure of pitch) and tracked variations in their voice pitch as they spoke. A low fundamental frequency would equate to sounding calm and in control, and has been found to be perceived as more dominant in both male and female voices, although the natural sex difference in absolute pitch was accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When talking to the highly dominant and prestigious employers, both male and female students who also perceived themselves as more dominant lowered their voice pitch, whilst students who perceived themselves to be less dominant did the opposite. These changes in pitch were most noticeable when the students explained why they were the best candidate and talked about how they would resolve the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings add to past research showing that lower voice pitch conveys traits related to social status, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/277/1699/3509&quot;&gt;physical strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/evan.20166/abstract%253Bjsessionid=7B1CDF1E0D76686151076240323D21EA.f03t03&quot;&gt;attractiveness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed that the students’ perception of their own status led them to use different vocal strategies in the interviews with the high-status employers. The students with higher self-perceived dominance may have felt more confident and in control of the situation, and thus more able to compete for the job. Conversely, for those who rated themselves less dominant, and may have felt more intimidated, appearing deferent to the employer may have been a beneficial strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the employers were actually computerised faces created to appear prestigious, dominant or neither, so it’s not clear how these findings would relate to a prestigious employer in real-life, or to a less formal social setting. Mock job interviews have been shown to increase anxiety, and recording the participants’ speech is likely to have increased their stress further, making voice alterations more or less pronounced than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real-life implications of the effect are also not known, as the study did not address which group were more likely to be successful in the interview. Whilst being intimidated might not come across well, it’s probably not a good idea to compete with your boss either. CEOs with lower-pitched voices tend to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(13)00023-8/fulltext&quot;&gt;manage larger companies and make more money&lt;/a&gt;, but then again, surgeons whose voices were perceived to be higher in dominance, and possibly arrogance, were more likely to have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.surgjournal.com/article/S0039-6060(02)00022-3/fulltext&quot;&gt;sued for malpractice&lt;/a&gt;.  Suffice then to say that, when asserting status, context – and subtlety – is key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179407&quot;&gt;Perceived differences in social status between speaker and listener affect the speaker’s vocal characteristics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/5800280179_79e5efb43d_o-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hepatitis B – What it is and why it matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2893.2003.00487.x/full&quot;&gt;2 billion individuals&lt;/a&gt; have been infected by Hepatitis B virus (HBV) at some point during their lifetime. Within the first 6 months after an individual is first infected with HBV, they experience a short term (acute) illness. In some cases of acute infection, the HBV remains in an individual’s body causing them to be chronically infected with Hepatitis B. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/hepatitis/publications/global-hepatitis-report2017/en/&quot;&gt;2015 WHO report on Hepatitis&lt;/a&gt; estimated 257 million people (3.5% of the global population) were living with a chronic HBV infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since HBV primarily attacks the liver, chronic HBV infection can imply significant long term health problems including liver damage, failure or even death. Untreated chronic infection can lead to life threatening long term complications such as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (a form of liver cancer). HBV is the 10th leading cause of death globally and results in &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2893.2003.00487.x/full&quot;&gt;500,000 to 700,000 deaths annually&lt;/a&gt;. Although relatively rare in the West, in regions where HBV remains endemic like Asia, the Western Pacific region and Africa, chronic HBV infection is common and individuals are often first exposed to the virus as infants or children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B can be spread through bodily fluids such as blood, semen etc. from an infected individual. The most common routes are sexual contact, sharing items (needles, razors, toothbrushes) with an infected person, exposure to infected blood or perinatal transmission (from a mother to child around the time of birth or during breastfeeding). The latter is the main route of transmission in areas where Hepatitis B is endemic like Asia, the Western Pacific and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The challenge and importance of preventing HBV transmission to infants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The younger an individual is when they contract acute HBV, the higher the likelihood that they will develop the chronic form. This is visualized in the graph below which reflects the percentage of individuals who become chronic HBV carriers in relation to the age at which they were acutely infected. For example approximately 90% of infants who are infected around the time of birth become chronic carriers , in contrast less than 5% of individuals acutely infected as adults are chronic carriers of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9323&quot; style=&quot;width: 519px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9323&quot; height=&quot;302&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/age-risk-HBV-e1501072076560.png&quot; width=&quot;509&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Data from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/hepatitis/publications/global-hepatitis-report2017/en/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WHO Global Hepatitis report 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To minimize the risk of infants being acutely infected, babies born to HBV-positive women are regularly given vaccines and other immunoprophylaxis after birth. However 5-10% of vaccinated infants still contract the acute form of the virus. This indicates additional intervention is required to effectively reduce or eliminate transmission to infants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infants are an especially critical target population in reducing the prevalence of Hepatitis B, especially since infection rates are still relatively high, and early exposure leads to a higher risk of the disease becoming a chronic life-long disease. For example, long term follow up of individuals infected as infants or young children showed that 15-25% of those chronically infected die prematurely due to cirrhosis or &lt;a href=&quot;http://jgo.amegroups.com/article/view/12998/10854&quot;&gt;hepatocellular carcinoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445312003891?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;High HBV activity in the mother correlates with the infant’s risk of contracting the condition&lt;/a&gt;, even if the infant has been immunized after birth. Therefore an antiviral therapy which reduces the HBV activity in the mother may be able to prevent the infant from contracting the disease. There are six globally licensed treatments for adults affected by chronic HBV, but none are currently regularly used in pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An antiviral drug &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telbivudine&quot;&gt;telbivudine&lt;/a&gt; is an attractive candidate for preventing mother to child transmission of HBV. It has been classified as pregnancy category B, which implies that no risk has been shown in other studies, but risk has not been definitively excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1542356512001553&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827811002832?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) have reported that administration of the antiviral telbivudine in the second and third trimesters was highly safe and effective in blocking mother to infant transmission . However, further extensive studies are required to ensure safety and efficacy before it can be considered for regular use during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue of establishing drug safety in pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9327&quot; style=&quot;width: 309px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-9327&quot; height=&quot;199&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/15514557255_56036a1775_o.jpg&quot; width=&quot;299&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Flickr, cc Jerry Lai&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is critical that any treatment given for a maternal medical condition, such as HBV, does not disrupt the baby’s normal process of development or cause significant negative side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was clearly illustrated by thalidomide, a drug taken by expecting mothers to combat morning sickness. When &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bdrc.21096/full&quot;&gt;thalidomide&lt;/a&gt; was first introduced as an over the counter drug in 1957, scientists did not believe drugs could cross the placenta and harm the fetus. Unfortunately, this was not the case and it is estimated that over 10,000 children in 46 countries were born with developmental abnormalities (classically of the limbs called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocomelia&quot;&gt;phocomelia&lt;/a&gt;)  as a result of thalidomide exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although finally taken off the market in 1961, the detrimental effects of thalidomide were long reaching and prompted the implementation of more rigorous rules for the testing and licensing of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, tolerability of a drug by the growing fetus may depend on its stage of development- certain drugs may therefore be potentially safe to take in late pregnancy but not during the first trimester when the fetus is very vulnerable to environmental insults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of HBV treatment during pregnancy, one of the questions which remains unanswered is whether there is a difference in efficacy if antivirals are given to pregnant women during early pregnancy, and additionally whether this can be tolerated by a more vulnerable, less developed fetus. To begin to answer this, Dr. Sun and colleagues recently conducted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12876-017-0608-7&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate the efficacy and safety of telbivudine if commenced in early or middle pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antiviral HBV treatment during early and mid-pregnancy &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sun and colleagues compared markers of HBV infection and activity in three different experimental groups. One group of women began the antiviral treatment in early pregnancy (12 weeks), another in middle pregnancy (20-28 weeks) while the third group acted as a control and received no drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per standard care, all infants in all groups received standard vaccinations and preventative treatment after birth. At 28 weeks following birth, infants were tested to check for the presence of HBV DNA or HBV antibodies, which indicates maternal to child transmission of the disease had occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the study were clear cut- none of the infants born to mothers who were receiving the antiviral treatment showed biological markers of the disease. In contrast, in the group that did not receive the antiviral during pregnancy, ~18% of infants had markers of HBV activity 28 weeks after their birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to previous studies, these results suggest that treating mothers during to pregnancy with the antiviral telbivudine together with infant vaccination at birth appears more effective than infant vaccination alone. Additionally, it suggests antiviral administration may be equally effective if begun in early versus middle pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the work by Sun and colleagues showed promising results, it also raises a number of other important questions which would need to be resolved before the antiviral can be used outside of controlled clinical trials. For example, the optimal timing and dosage are still to be determined, as well as how late in pregnancy the antiviral can be given and still successfully prevent transmission. Additionally, while no ill effects were observed in the infants whose mothers received telbivudine during pregnancy, it is important to note that potential negative effects have not been ruled out and more extensive studies with long term follow up are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides a critical stepping stone towards the development, implementation and safety of programs which could drastically reduce the perinatal transmission of HBV- and provide infants a healthy start to life.&lt;/p&gt;
