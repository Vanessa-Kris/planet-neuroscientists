&lt;p&gt;“Conferences on psychedelics are popping up everywhere, like mushrooms!” said Jakobien van der Weijden, of the Psychedelic Society of the Netherlands, when I met her in Amsterdam last week. Indeed, research into the use of psychedelic (mind-altering) drugs as tools in the treatment of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and end-of-life angst, is on the increase. Psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, may help to alleviate symptoms of depression by altering brain activity in key areas &lt;a href=&quot;http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_12-1-2018-14-13-41&quot;&gt;involved in emotional processing&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881117731279&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Psychopharmacology&lt;/i&gt;, led by Roland Griffiths at Johns Hopkins University, has found that for mentally and physically healthy volunteers, two doses of psilocybin in conjunction with a programme of meditation and other “spiritual” practices was enough to bring about lasting, positive changes to traits including altruism, gratitude, forgiveness and feeling close to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33066&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 75 healthy adults, with an average age of 42, from the general population, and allocated them at random to one of three groups. The first group enrolled in “standard-level” support for spiritual practice, which consisted of a meditation book plus five hours meditation and spiritual training with an experienced “guide”. These participants then took two very low doses of psilocybin (just 1mg per 70kg – intended to act as a placebo), spaced one month apart, with each dose followed by a discussion of the experience with their spiritual guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second group of participants had the same level of spiritual practice support, but they were given higher doses of psilocybin – 20 mg/70kg for the first dose, and 30mg/70kg for the second (both fit into the range of dosages likely from recreational use of magic mushrooms.). Earlier studies have shown that psilocybin has various effects on the brain. It &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13282-7&quot;&gt;reduces blood flow in the amygdala&lt;/a&gt;, which is involved in emotional responses, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third group took the higher doses of psilocybin but also had far more extensive support and face-to-face time with their guides, and this continued for four months after their second dose of psilocybin. This included taking part in twice-monthly, 90-minute group dialogue sessions, in which they were encouraged to focus on discussing their successes and challenges in sustaining the regular spiritual practices of meditation, awareness and journaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the participants nor the guides knew which psilocybin doses they had received. Six months after the start of the study, both of the high-dose groups showed large, statistically significant positive changes on measures of interpersonal closeness, gratitude, life meaning or purpose, death transcendence, daily spiritual experiences, and religious faith and coping, whereas the placebo group did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-dose, high-support group scored highest on all the scales. In some cases, such as life meaning and a rating of life “strivings” as being sacred or spiritual, they scored much higher. Unlike the high dose/standard support group, they also showed a big increase in trait forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted, “Strikingly, more than half of participants in the high spiritual support condition rated their experience in one or both psilocybin sessions as the single most spiritually significant experience of their life, with 96 per cent rating it as among the top five most spiritually significant experiences.” In contrast, the percentages for the high-dose, standard support group were 40 per cent and 76 per cent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the differences in their perception of the sessions, and their rates of engagement with meditation and other spiritual practices, that explained why the high-support, high-dose group showed larger trait changes and more intense spiritual experiences than the modest-support high-dose group, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that the people recruited for the study all responded to an advert for volunteers who were interested in “developing their spiritual lives by participating in a study of the combined effects of meditation and psilocybin”. It’s not clear, then, whether this kind of programme could help people who aren’t particularly interested in developing their spiritual lives. Since there was no low-dose, high-support group, it’s also hard to be sure how important psilocybin was to the observed effects – perhaps the intensive “spiritual practices” and support were the more critical ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the work does suggest that further investigation of the effects of psilocybin may in theory lead to new interventions, not only to help people with a mental health disorder, but to create positive changes in attitudes and behaviour in healthy people. But there would have to be a change in the law. At the moment, in the UK, as in many other countries, psilocybin can only be consumed legally as part of an approved academic research programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other researchers involved in studies of psychedelic drugs have stressed that this work is still experimental, and have warned against self-medication. Magic mushrooms and closely-related psilocybin-containing truffles (which are legal in the Netherlands), contain varying levels of the drug, so it’s impossible to be sure of the dosage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881117731279&quot;&gt;Psilocybin-occasioned mystical-type experience in combination with meditation and other spiritual practices produces enduring positive changes in psychological functioning and in trait measures of prosocial attitudes and behaviors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists have retracted a 2016 paper examining the genetic underpinnings of a degenerative motor neuron disease, after discovering that two mouse lines had been accidentally mislabeled.

&lt;p&gt;Discussion of the menopause tends be negative. Take the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05tx859&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; introduction to “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05tpw79&quot;&gt;menopause week&lt;/a&gt;” held this week on BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio Sheffield. The well-meaning presenters talk of “distress”, the impact, the “troubling” changes, and “how to get through it”. Of course the aim is to support and educate, and it’s important to acknowledge the seriousness of some women’s problems. However, there’s arguably a risk that an overly negative tone perpetuates beliefs and stereotypes that may foster unjustified dread about the menopause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0167482X.2017.1368486&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of PsychoSomatic Obstetrics and Gynecology&lt;/em&gt;, involving nearly 400 women aged between 40 and 60, overall women have a positive view of the menopause. What’s more, women who’ve gone through the menopause have a more positive take on it than those who’ve yet to start or who are in the middle of it. “In other words,” write Lydia Brown at the University of Melbourne and her colleagues, “for most women the menopausal transition may turn out to be not as bad as they think”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33056&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers asked their participants to complete the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247510899_Cognitive_appraisal_of_the_menopause_The_menopause_representations_questionnaire_MRQ&quot;&gt;Menopausal Representations Questionnaire&lt;/a&gt; that includes questions about symptoms they attribute to the menopause, their thoughts and beliefs about the consequences of the menopause, the menopause timeline, and their perceptions of control. The researchers also devised a new scale addressing the participants’ emotions in relation to the menopause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, participants said whether they felt (or expected to feel) anxious or less confident; whether they thought the menopause would last a long time; whether they were anxious about it; whether they were, or would be, pleased to be free of the risk of pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women’s responses were positive overall. On average they disagreed that the menopause made them feel upset, angry or afraid, although they agreed it made them feel somewhat anxious and slightly more depressed. The women agreed most strongly with statements about what may be considered advantages to going through the menopause, such as the end of periods and the end of using birth control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the sample, 54 of the women were premenopausal, 48 were in the early or later stages of the menopause, and 286 had finished going through the menopause. The postmenopausal women were more positive about the menopause than the women currently going through it, although this difference was modest. In terms of their emotions, the postmenopausal women were more positive about the menopause than the premenopausal women and those currently in the menopause, and the magnitude of this difference was “clinically significant”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers speculated that perhaps the more negative views and emotions of the premenopausal and early menopausal women is related to “affective forecasting theory”, which describes how we tend to overestimate the impact of future events on our emotions, and underestimate our ability to adapt and cope. Alternatively, perhaps the findings are explained by a more general trend for people to become more optimistic as they get older. Alternatively, or as well, maybe the postmenopausal women had developed more effective coping strategies over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the explanation, and while acknowledging that their study was limited by its cross-sectional design (it would be better to study the same women before, during and after the menopause), the researchers said their findings suggest that the more negative views held by premenopausal women may reflect a “degree of stereotype internalisation”. It may be “that the ‘dread’ of the upcoming menopause is culturally influenced”, they said, adding: “Our data show that cognitive and emotional representations of the menopause are most positive in the post menopause, when women have had the lived experience of the menopause”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0167482X.2017.1368486&quot;&gt;It’s not as bad as you think: menopausal representations are more positive in postmenopausal women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New research on gender identity disorder (also known as gender dysphoria, in which a person does not identify with their biological sex) questions how best to handle the condition when it arises in children and adolescents. Should biological treatments be used as early as possible to help a young client transition, or is caution required, in case of complicating psychological issues?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanie Bechard of the University of Toronto and her colleagues examined the prevalence of “psychosocial and psychological vulnerabilities” in 50 child and teen cases of gender dysphoria, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0092623X.2016.1232325&quot;&gt;writing in a recent issue of the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they argue their findings show that physicians should be considering these factors more seriously when deciding on a treatment plan. Salting the situation, one of the paper’s co-authors is Kenneth Zucker, an expert on gender dysphoria who was last year considered too controversial for Canadian state television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33058&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As recently as 2013, Zucker headed the American Psychiatric Association’s group deciding &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:http%252525253A//displus.sk/DSM/subory/dsm5.pdf&quot;&gt;the diagnostic criteria&lt;/a&gt; for gender dysphoria, but he fell from grace in 2015 when he was fired from his clinic at the Toronto Centre for Addiction and Mental Health for failing to follow the now prominent “gender-affirmative” approach that places a clinical emphasis on smoothing the process of gender transition for children and adolescents who say they no longer identify with their biological sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zucker’s approach, in contrast, was more hesitant and he questioned the ease with which young people can draw conclusions about their gender identity during a universally tumultuous stage of life. He also placed more emphasis on the costs that transition may bear upon an individual. To say that he considered transition a last resort would be as much of a caricature as saying the gender affirmative approach considers it a first resort, but they clearly represent different points on this spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Zucker’s critics he was a transphobe, his approach analogous to gay conversion therapy (the now widely condemned use of psychological therapy to attempt to alter a client’s sexual orientation) – for example, he reportedly advised some parents to discourage their younger children from behaving in ways that contradicted their assigned gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, hostility toward Zucker’s views was substantive enough to lead the Canadian broadcaster CBC to pull a BBC documentary that reported his perspective. For his part,  Zucker continues to maintain that his priority has always been the wellbeing of his clinical charges. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0092623X.2016.1232325&quot;&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; that he co-authored with Bechard and others puts into the scientific record one of the concerns of his clinic, that gender dysphoric youth are a psychologically vulnerable population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper examines the case files of 17 people assigned a male gender and 33 people assigned a female gender, at birth, based on their biological sex. Following their experience of gender dysphoria, the clients had been referred to a specialist gender identity service for young people, at which time they were aged 13 to 20. Sixty-four per cent of the clients were homosexual with respect to the gender they were assigned at birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked for evidence of 15 factors that can signify or contribute to psychological issues, from self-harm to a previous outpatient therapy visit, and found that over half their sample had six or more of these factors. The majority had two or more prior diagnoses of a psychological disorder, the most common being a mood disorder such as depression. More than half had reported thinking about suicide, a third had dropped out of high school, a quarter had self harmed. A history of sexual abuse was rarer, observed in ”only” 10 per cent of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these measures are likely to be underestimates because they depended on the clients’ own descriptions during their initial interview at the gender identity clinic. Without a control group, it’s hard to say whether these rates of psychological distress are higher than for other client groups. Certainly though, the findings are consistent with the sense that these individuals were already in a state of psychological vulnerability when they were referred for gender dysphoria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bechard’s team present in-depth examples of two clients, both assigned as female at birth, that bring these psychological complexities to life, demonstrating the kinds of situations these cases often involve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first individual was very intelligent but struggling socially, especially around girls. They were fixated on emphasising their femininity in selfies, leading the parents to suspect body dysmorphic disorder (a troubling belief that there is something wrong with one’s body). This individual’s boyfriend then came out as gay. Sometime following this, the client disclosed that they identified as a boy. This change in identity happened “overnight” with no developmental history of cross-gender identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second client’s history is more convoluted: at around age 12-13 this individual had disclosed that they were transgender (now identifying as male), and had felt this way for a while. This individual also had a history of anxiety, social problems interacting with girls, and extreme anxiety about sexuality. From the point of disclosing their gender dysphoria, they also reported that they were gay (oriented towards men) but had no interest in romantic/sexual relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both these cases, after an initial assessment the individual was given testosterone treatment by a physician against the wishes of the parents – in the first case, the physician actually refused to meet the parents, and in the second, the physician recorded that the issues raised by the parents regarding anxiety, sexual and social problems weren’t relevant for the course of action. Sadly, in the case of the second individual, a few months after the start of the hormone treatment, they made a suicide attempt that required hospitalisation; the reasons for this were not reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are the indicators of psychological vulnerability identified in these case histories the consequence, cause or simply coincident to gender identity disorder? If they are all solely a fall-out from the gender dysphoria, then the decisive approach of the physicians described above has a certain sense to it. But if some of the psychological complications pre-dated the gender dysphoria, or were separate from it, then at the very least this would suggest that the consulted physicians should have considered a broader treatment plan, and considered the psychological complications when judging their clients’ “readiness” to commence biomedical treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility that disclosure of gender dysphoria may in some cases be driven by earlier psychological vulnerabilities and social problems seems likely to be greater than zero. This is a controversial idea among many online trans activists, but actually it isn’t among health practitioners, even those who espouse the gender affirmation philosophy, who recognise that some young gender identity referrals may be transiently mixed-up individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of pre-existing or concurrent psychological vulnerabilities also speaks to the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sexologytoday.org/2016/01/do-trans-kids-stay-trans-when-they-grow_99.html&quot;&gt;a substantial proportion, perhaps even the majority&lt;/a&gt;, of children who experience some form of gender identity challenge, later come to endorse the gender they were raised as (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sexologytoday.org/2017/12/faulty-statistics-on-how-many-trans.html&quot;&gt;further commentary and discussion&lt;/a&gt;); the new findings may also be relevant to the experience of detransitioning individuals, who reach similar conclusions, but often after a much greater investment in the process of transition – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/25/bath-spa-university-transgender-gender-reassignment-reversal-research&quot;&gt;a phenomenon that is struggling to get scientific attention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when a child with gender dysphoria is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/fight-over-trans-kids-got-a-researcher-fired.html&quot;&gt;insistent, persistent, and consistent&lt;/a&gt;” over an extended period, then (under the gender affirmative approach) this is typically treated as a good indicator that it is appropriate to begin facilitating the transition process. The trouble is, psychological vulnerabilities can also be persistent, and if a young person feels like they’ve found the solution, it’s understandable that they might not want to let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life can sometimes feel as complicated as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot&quot;&gt;Gordian knot&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary challenge that was seemingly impossible to disentangle. It’s understandable to weigh up a radical solution, like Alexander the Great cleaving the knot with a single sword-stroke: to abandon your external environment for a new home, to step outside of the confines of an identity that may be the source of the myriad issues plaguing you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research from Bechard, Zucker and company provides preliminary evidence about the psychological vulnerabilities of children and teens with gender dysphoria, extending &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287578799_Merkmale_von_Kindern_und_Jugendlichen_mit_Geschlechtsdysphorie_in_der_Hamburger_Spezialsprechstunde&quot;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25431051&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; that’s shown high rates of self-harm and suicidal ideation in this group, but more research is required to give us the full clinical picture. As such, this new paper represents just the latest sally in a difficult, complicated conversation that’s far from over: a conversation about how we can most compassionately treat those who feel out of step with where they find themselves in the social world.&lt;/p&gt;

 I just learned about a truly remarkable case in which a doctor apparently wrote a paper about a serial killer who murdered her five children - without realizing what had happened. It's an old case, but it doesn't seem to be widely known today.

The paper is called Prolonged apnea and the sudden infant death syndrome: clinical and laboratory observations and it was written in 1972 by Dr Alfred Steinschneider of Syracuse, New York. In this paper, Steinschneider described the case of a woman, &quot;Mr</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/featureimage-140x110.gif&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcdevbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12861-017-0160-2&quot;&gt;In vivo imaging of epithelial wound healing in the cnidarian &lt;em&gt;Clytia hemisphaerica&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates early evolution of purse string and cell crawling closure mechanisms.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms of wound healing have always been a highly discussed topic across many fields of science. In their paper, Kamran et al. discuss cell crawling and purse string mechanisms (a supracellular contractile ring that contracts to draw the wound margins inward) in the cnidarian &lt;em&gt;Clytia hemisphaerica&lt;/em&gt;, a cousin to the jellyfish. Although these mechanisms are well documented, Kamran et al.’s study presents a fascinating insight into wound healing in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of electron microcopy, staining techniques and various imaging techniques, Kamran et were able to document the wound healing mechanisms in live subjects. As well as developing a wound healing assay in the cnidarian &lt;em&gt;Clytia hemisphaerica&lt;/em&gt;, Kamran et al. were also able to establish which wound healing mechanisms occur in this species, discovering that wound healing occurs rapidly and independently of cell proliferation. In addition, they also establish that the implementation of either Lamellipodia-dependent cell crawling or the classical purse string mechanism depends on the integrity of the basement membrane. This fascinating article has shown potential for a &lt;em&gt;Clytia&lt;/em&gt; model for wound healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9771&quot; style=&quot;width: 578px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9771 size-full&quot; height=&quot;762&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/image-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;568&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure taken from the article documenting lamellipodia-dependent cell migration within the cnidarian &lt;em&gt;Clytia hemisphaerica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcdevbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12861-017-0158-9&quot;&gt;The asymmetric cell division machinery in the spiral-cleaving egg and embryo of the marine annelid &lt;em&gt;Platynereis dumerilii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of asymmetric cell division goes without question. The division of cells within a zygote is imperative to the organization of cellular fates, which, in summary, is essential for the development of organs.   Spiral cleavage (the division of cells in a spiral manner), however, only occurs in species such as mollusks and annelids. In their fascinating paper, Nakama et al. sought to analyze the machinery that is involved in spiral-cleaving egg and embryo of the marine annelid &lt;em&gt;Platynereis dumerilii&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their study, Nakama et al. were able to identify and classify genes that are important to asymmetric cell division in the eggs and early embryos of &lt;em&gt;Platynereis dumerilii&lt;/em&gt; by analyzing their stage-specific transcriptome data. They were able to establish that most of the components in the spiral cleavage of marine annelid &lt;em&gt;Platynereis dumerilii&lt;/em&gt; are maternal, which suggests that the sprialian egg in this species requires most of the components for asymmetric cell division to ensure rapid cell division. Furthermore, Nakama et al. have effectively carried out a systems-level analysis which has allowed them to identify key regulatory components that are expressed in the &lt;em&gt;Platynereis dumerilii&lt;/em&gt; zygote, providing an in-depth insight into the early development of the marine annelid &lt;em&gt;Platynereis dumerilii&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite comparative gene expression being important in developmental and evolutionary research, it seems that spatial expression surveys are restricted to models such as zebrafish and other laboratory models. In this fascinating paper, Bloomquist et al. have produced a compendium of developmental gene expression in a Lake Malawi cichlid fishes, a model that is used to conduct research into the developmental and genetic basis of trait diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this exciting study, Bloomquist et al. have managed to acquire expression data for many important expression pathways in the Lake Malawi cichlid fishes, including the TGF-β/BMP pathway, FGF pathway and the notch pathway, pathways which are well documented in many laboratory models, including zebrafish, xenopus and the more distantly related chicken. In addition, Bloomquist et al. have also observed stem cell/mitogenic factors, as well as calcium and endocrine signals, at 4 and 6 days post-fertilization, which are rarely seen in whole mount studies such as these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Bloomquist et al. have managed to start crafting a compendium which has opened the door for possible future studies into the function of the genes expressed at the early development of Lake Malawi cichlid fishes, which could be applied to many species of Eastern African cichlid fishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9774&quot; style=&quot;width: 577px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9774&quot; height=&quot;715&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/image-3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;567&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure taken from the article documenting the Expression of genes from the TGF-β/BMP pathway at pharyngeal and larval stages&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/DPC_logo_v_hires-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-9780&quot; height=&quot;1920&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/DPC_logo_h_hires-1.png&quot; width=&quot;6720&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of minority underrepresentation in science is not new and yet it remains deeply challenging. Just 8 percent of science and engineering doctorate holders in the United States are underrepresented minorities, compared to 30 percent in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What gives us hope that we can yet achieve inclusive science is the National Institutes of Health-funded Diversity Program Consortium (DPC) which we learn about in depth in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-11-supplement-12&quot;&gt;The Diversity Program Consortium: Innovating Educational Practice and Evaluation Along the Biomedical Research Pathways&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;BMC Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; supplement dives into the critical work of the DPC and its components: the Building Infrastructure Leading to Diversity (BUILD) Initiative, the National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN), and the Coordination and Evaluation Center (CEC). These are based on a comprehensive approach to changing institutional culture and practice, combined with rigorous evaluation that supports the success of a stronger, diverse biomedical research workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biomedical research advances healthcare for all Americans. It is strengthened when we include researchers who bring a broad range of perspectives to the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is a priority for our nation. When we wrote the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report, &lt;em&gt;Expanding Underrepresented Minority Participation: America’s Science and Technology Talent at the Crossroads, &lt;/em&gt;our focus on the &lt;u&gt;crossroads&lt;/u&gt; was intentional because we have choices to make. Do we want a robust scientific enterprise fueling innovation that drives our future? Do we want the best STEM workforce for that enterprise?  Will we draw on our nation’s talent – from all backgrounds – for the strongest workforce possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomedical research advances healthcare for all Americans. It is strengthened when we include researchers who bring a broad range of perspectives to the work. Our focus on health disparities ensures advances in healthcare reach every community and address their needs. This work is strengthened when researchers from diverse communities engage in formulating the questions and conducting the research. We achieve this through inclusive science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A long way to go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly we have never been close to realizing a fully inclusive research workforce. &lt;em&gt;In Rising Above the Gathering Storm&lt;/em&gt;, the National Academies recommended we increase the percentage of our 24-year-olds with a first university degree in STEM from 6 to 10 percent. To be inclusive as we achieve this, we would need to triple, quadruple, or quintuple the numbers of underrepresented minorities in STEM.  Just 3.3 percent of Native Americans/Alaska Natives, 2.7 percent of African Americans, and 2.2 percent of Hispanics hold these degrees. This stems from persistent underrepresentation of minorities in science that deepens as we ascend the ladder from primary grades, through college, to research careers capped with R01 research funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-11-supplement-12&quot;&gt;This supplement of &lt;em&gt;BMC Proceedings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describes how BUILD actively supports minority students through innovative training strategies that address academic and psychosocial factors, support persistence, and overcome the negative effects of implicit bias, hostile climates, or isolation. The work is systemic, focusing on curriculum development, undergraduate research, mentoring, and institutional partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) is one of 10 BUILD grantees. We are using our grant to extend what we learned from our Meyerhoff Scholars Programs for high-achieving minorities to a broader population of undergraduates in the sciences. Nine other BUILD campuses are implementing programs organic to their populations, drawing on exemplary practice and innovating in their curricula, pedagogy, faculty development, and mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For us, at UMBC, quality is defined by the rigor of the work plus the support that allows students to achieve high standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many well-prepared students, including minorities, who arrive on our campuses intending to major in STEM or the biomedical sciences. Unfortunately, many departments still define quality in terms of the number of students they can weed out, which removes talent that our nation needs. For us, at UMBC, quality is defined by the rigor of the work plus the support that allows students to achieve high standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people come to our campus they are often surprised to find minorities among the highest achieving students in science. That is our vision at UMBC. For institutions to be successful in fostering inclusive excellence, this must be the vision on all campuses, as well. Too often these initiatives are left to junior faculty without the authority to re-think policies and practices. To the extent that respected researchers become involved and academic administrators take ownership of this initiative, we will see substantive progress in increasing the numbers of successful students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This supplement also describes the NRMN and the CEC. The NRMN has five regional hubs that recruit skilled mentors and partner them with underrepresented minority mentees who do not have a mentor to guide them. The CEC at UCLA coordinates across grantees and conducts assessments to identify long-term outcomes and scalable, best practice. We believe that evaluation is critical to the DPC’s work as it supports both program development and dissemination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of change agents who recruit supporters and allies and working tirelessly for success cannot be overstated. The next step is to disseminate what is working to other institutions in a way that inspires academic leaders to become invested and allows campus change agents to readily adapt best practice to their institutional settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to imagine a crueller fate than when a child receives a diagnosis of an illness as difficult as cancer. A young human being, still not fully formed, is suddenly and irrevocably thrown into a situation that many adults are unable to cope with. Each year, &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21219/abstract;jsessionid=A25F53B917E2715D7E8CDFE1D5BDF3AD.f04t02&quot;&gt;around 160,000 children and youngsters worldwide are diagnosed with cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and this trend is growing in industrialised societies. Faced with such facts, it is particularly important to understand how children cope. What traces of the experience remain in their psyche if they manage to survive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partial answers to these questions come from a trio of Australian researchers in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pon.4577/abstract&quot;&gt;systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of existing research into the psychological effects of cancer on children, published recently in &lt;i&gt;Psycho-Oncology&lt;/i&gt;. Their findings give us reason for some optimism. It turns out children and adolescents affected by cancer are no more likely to develop post-traumatic stress symptoms than their healthy peers. In fact, several studies have found that children affected by cancer go on to experience greater than usual adjustment and quality of life and lower anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms. In psychology, we refer to this as the post-traumatic growth (PTG) effect, which can arise from the struggle with highly challenging life circumstances or trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33021&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results from the analysed body of research – 18 studies in all – indicated that participants who were older when surveyed, or older when diagnosed with cancer, were more likely to experience PTG. Most likely, this is a product of the development of abstract reasoning that occurs sometime after the 11th or 12th year of life, when adolescents begin to formulate their own value systems, take an interest in philosophical ideas, and think about the meaning of life – cognitive processes that are involved in the development of PTG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meta-analysis also revealed a small but statistically significant correlation between post-traumatic stress and PTG. By definition, the struggle with trauma is necessary for the development of PTG, because it is during such struggles with disease that a teenager may experience both obsessive thoughts about death, but also may begin to appreciate life more. The vision of losing the normalcy that healthy people take for granted can turn into affirmation of that very normalcy. It is precisely these difficult experiences in youth that contribute to the formation of individuals who psychologists refer to as “prematurely mature”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The least surprising result was the positive link between PTG and having greater social support, as well as between PTG and being more optimistic. Unfortunately, these correlations don’t tell us whether social support and optimism lead to PTG, or if the reverse is true. Further studies may identify the causal relations between these factors. In turn this may help inform the development of support programmes targeting children with cancer and other difficult illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new meta-analysis also looked for potential correlations between PTG and depression, anxiety, pessimism, and quality of life, but all were statistically nonsignificant. Jasmin Turner and her colleagues suspect that this could be caused by small sample sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, psychology has treated negative human experiences as unequivocally harmful to people, assuming that they lead to post-traumatic stress disorder, and poorer psychological and physical functioning. Regardless of their actual psychological state, people who have survived negative experiences have sometimes been treated like patients in need of help, and at times &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/01/16/is-it-time-to-resurrect-post-trauma-psychological-debriefing-for-emergency-responders-and-aid-workers/&quot;&gt;this help has even proved harmful to them&lt;/a&gt;. The discovery that following some traumatic situations, tears can turn into pearls is one of the more significant and promising discoveries of psychology. Understanding when and why this happens is a means for science to make a clear contribution to improving people’s well-being. And while the new results are not very strong, nevertheless they may help guide future research, potentially helping social support and clinical interventions for cancer patients. Also important is consideration of the factors leading to PTG and how to share this information appropriately and sensitively with people suffering illnesses. However, before we can label any such programmes as “evidence based”, further studies are necessary, particularly longitudinal research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it is not worth waiting passively for the results of such studies. With the knowledge that the experience of trauma can lead to PTG, we can begin providing intelligent support to people whose luck is down – encouraging reflection on the experience of trauma, rather than mechanical consolation with exhortations to think positively. &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/20/new-meta-analysis-undermines-the-myth-that-negative-emotions-can-cause-cancer/&quot;&gt;Intelligent support should be an unobtrusive presence, without encouraging the rejection of negative emotions, and without attempts at eliciting positive ones&lt;/a&gt;. In all certainty, this kind of approach will be different from the offerings we have received for many years from some &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/11/14/positive-psychology-exercises-can-be-harmful-for-some/&quot;&gt;unreflexive positive psychologists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/2809961438_56d48f9969_z-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;School closure, a necessary break for both teachers and students, is also associated with mitigating influenza outbreaks. Purposely closing schools during outbreaks of influenza is not officially recommended by the World Health Organisation; however, this non-pharmaceutical intervention is well regarded as an approach in reducing the epidemic impact. A well-known example of this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-207&quot;&gt;closure of schools during the swine flu epidemic&lt;/a&gt; in the UK, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Luca &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;’s study considers the effect of regulated school holidays in interrupting influenza propagation by offering variety in social mixing and travel – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21176155&quot;&gt;two key determinants&lt;/a&gt; of influenza epidemic potency. The authors aimed to integrate social mixing and travel of children and adults during school/holiday periods into a spatial metapopulation that also utilised data based on demographics and infection dynamics. Focusing on the 2008/2009 influenza season in Belgium, the mathematical model was calibrated to the singular district of Brussels which showed accurate scalability to a national level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors observed how the growth of the number of new infections significantly slowed during the Christmas holidays whereas the fall and Easter holidays had little effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model was further parameterized with influenza-like-illness (ILI) data reported by the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health. Once the Belgian school calendar was applied, the authors tested a number of experimental scenarios. Different scheduled holidays were first removed and replaced with regular school/working weeks from the model to observe the effect on an epidemic’s timing and intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors observed how the growth of the number of new infections significantly slowed during the Christmas holidays whereas the fall and Easter holidays had little effect. The benefit of weekends in periodically slowing down the epidemic curve &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002251931200375X&quot;&gt;was also observed&lt;/a&gt;. Altering the contact and behaviour among groups of people over weekends and holidays is thought to alter epidemic dynamics, causing a smaller epidemic with less incidences. Altered mixing behaviour during weekends and holidays was found more influential on the spread of an epidemic than travel was in this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthering the observation that &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/215/5/732/2751325&quot;&gt;Christmas holidays can play a large role on epidemic impact&lt;/a&gt;, extension methods were tested. Adding a week of holiday before Christmas had no impact on the epidemics timing or severity, however, whilst extending the Christmas holidays could not delay the epidemic, it could reduce the severity as the number of ILIs decreased. Additional breaks beyond Christmas may also prove to have a mitigating impact, but the whole calendar must be considered as holidays throughout the year all affect the epidemic’s evolution differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis on a single season represents how the impact of regular school closures slow and mitigate influenza epidemics. However, the epidemic impact of school closure is heavily dependent on the closure timing and influenza season. The authors also noted that contacts and their changes throughout the calendar are likely to be country-specific. An improved understanding on the behavioural changes caused by an epidemic are required to further parameterize models for epidemic management which may be achieved by incorporating additional seasons and more specific age groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the impact that school closures can have on influenza may help manage future epidemics and attenuate pressure placed on public health services. These findings may be of relevant use to authorities considering reducing summer holidays to redistribute spare holidays throughout the year to manage the influenza season. The results from this study have helped shine light on previous studies performed throughout the world; therefore, it would be worthwhile to apply similar models in different countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve had all day to worry, but your brain decides that the moment you rest your weary head upon your pillow is the precise instant it wants to start fretting. The result of course is that you feel wide awake and cannot sleep. Two possible solutions: (1) spend five minutes before lights out writing about everything you have done. This might give you a soothing sense of achievement. Or (2) spend five minutes writing a comprehensive to-do list. This could serve to off-load your worries, or perhaps it will only make them more salient? To find out which is the better strategy, a team led by Michael Scullin at Baylor University, invited 57 volunteers to their sleep lab and had half of them try technique 1 and half try technique 2. &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-47677-001&quot;&gt;Their findings&lt;/a&gt; are published in the latest issue of the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: General&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33034&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants, aged 18 to 30, attended the sleep lab at about 9pm on a weekday night. They filled out questionnaires about their usual sleep habits and underwent basic medical tests. Once in their sound-proofed room and wired up to equipment that uses brain waves to measure sleep objectively, they were told that lights out would be 10.30pm. Before they tried to sleep, half of the participants spent five minutes “writing about everything you have to remember to do tomorrow and over the next few days”. The others spent the same time writing about any activities they’d completed that day and over the previous few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key finding is that the participants in the to-do list condition fell asleep more quickly. They took about 15 minutes to fall asleep, on average, compared with 25 minutes for those in the “jobs already done” condition. Moreover, among those in the to-do list group, the more thorough and specific their list, the more quickly they fell asleep, which would seem to support a kind of off-loading explanation. Another interpretation is that busier people, who had more to write about, tended to fall asleep more quickly. But this is undermined by the fact that among the jobs-done group, those who wrote in more detail tended to take longer to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rather than journal about the day’s completed tasks or process tomorrow’s to-do list in one’s mind, the current experiment suggests that individuals spend five minutes near bedtime thoroughly writing a to-do list,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the experiment didn’t have a baseline no-intervention control group, so it’s possible that the shorter time-to-sleep of the to-do list writing intervention was actually a reflection of journaling about completed jobs making it harder to fall asleep. Also, note the current sample didn’t have any sleep problems. Scullin and his team say the next step is to conduct a longer-running randomised control trial of the to-do list intervention outside of the sleep lab, with people who do and don’t have sleep-onset insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-47677-001&quot;&gt;The Effects of Bedtime Writing on Difficulty Falling Asleep:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

It’s not by assessing individual works but by consideration and evaluation of consistent contributions to a discipline over time. Contributions may be independently substantial, but in science, a researcher’s impact is more often made through gradual insights that accrue meaning as a discipline advances. Over the course of a career, creative thinkers and leaders in science can significantly influence a field, and humanity more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recently established award provides one measure of lifetime achievement for life sciences—the Breakthrough Prize. Established in 2013, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://breakthroughprize.org/Prize/2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; honors “transformative advances toward understanding living systems and extending human life.” The prize encourages celebration and recognition of “outstanding minds.” Those scientists who “think big, take risks and have made a significant impact on our lives” each receive $3 million for their work that provides fundamental and far-reaching understanding of biological mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences is designed to bring public attention, financial reward and a bit of glamor to outstanding scientists who over the course of their careers have changed the way scientists think about basic principles. Through a central component of the award, the impact of honored scientists’ work is extended to a broader general audience. Recipients are invited to present public talks – with recorded lectures made &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://breakthroughprize.org/Lectures&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;available to the public&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – “allowing everyone to keep abreast of the latest developments in life sciences, guided by contemporary masters of the field,” according to the Breakthrough Prize website. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://breakthroughprize.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Breakthrough Prizes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are also awarded in fundamental physics and mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, five scientists received life sciences prizes; collectively these creative thinkers have published 30 papers in PLOS journals (13 in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;, 16 in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; and one in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/em&gt;), providing their work to the global community free of access and reuse restrictions.

&lt;p&gt;Two scientists, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://breakthroughprize.org/Laureates/2/L3825&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kazutoshi Mori&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of Kyoto University, Japan, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://breakthroughprize.org/Laureates/2/L3824&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Peter Walter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of the University of California, San Francisco, received Breakthrough Prizes for their independent work on “elucidating the unfolded protein response, a cellular quality-control system that detects disease-causing unfolded proteins and directs cells to take corrective measures.” The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a phylogenetically conserved endoplasmic reticulum-to-nucleus signaling pathway that senses unfolded proteins early on in the biosynthetic process, and then transmits that information to the cell nucleus. This information stimulates a genetic transcription program designed to re-establish cellular homeostasis by increasing the intracellular machinery and processes that help proteins fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various cellular insults, writes Mori in his team’s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040374&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; article, “including exposure to pharmacological agents that perturb protein folding, genetic mutation of ER chaperones or chaperone substrates, viral infection, metabolic demands, and even normal differentiation and function of professional secretory cells” impact the UPR in similar and unique ways. His earlier work &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plos.io/Mori_BTP2018&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published with PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; examined the differential influence of low-level, severe and chronic stress on UPR activation. More recently, Mori has extended his investigations to the development of a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161486&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;high-throughput screening assay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that incorporates a molecular biosensor to identify small molecule activators of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in malignant glioma cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since 2004, Walter has published &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plos.io/Walter_BTP2018&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;12 papers with PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; covering the role of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040423&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;endoplasmic reticulum expansion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the UPR in yeast; a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0004170&quot;&gt;teasing out&lt;/a&gt; of the relationship between cell proliferation, cell death and protein folding in human embryonic kidney cell lines; and the importance of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001735&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;targeting a key transcription factor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to the cell membrane, to provide the appropriate cellular response to protein folding status in bacteria. Walter’s first two papers published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;, presented as a series together with a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020269&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Synopsis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, described amplitude adjustment signals for the UPR in yeast. Prior to this work, the UPR was thought to largely be a binary, on or off, function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_7970&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7970 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/01/Walter-288x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;288&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003528&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0003528&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more than other prize recipients, Joanne Chory was surprised by her inclusion as an awardee, explaining to the &lt;em&gt;San Diego Union-Tribune&lt;/em&gt;, “this prize has been more associated with biomedical things.” The award may be a nod to the relevance of Chory’s current work to climate change. Those interested in the connection between mechanisms of sunlight and clock-regulated plant development to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salk.edu/news-release/salk-institutes-joanne-chory-awarded-prestigious-breakthrough-prize-life-sciences/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; may find of interest the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.plos.org/eco-climate-change&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ecological Impacts of Climate Change Collection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and newly launched &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/rtcc&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Responding to Climate Change Channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International lifetime achievement awards are given in many fields, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sioe.org/sioe-awards&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldmusicawards.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.sif.it/activities/fermi_award&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;physical sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. With support of founding sponsors Mark Zuckerberg, Priscilla Chan, Sergey Brin, Anne Wojcicki and Yuri Milner, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/09/2017-lasker-awards/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;life sciences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has another prize of its own, with a musical perk. This year’s awardees were honored at a gala hosted by Morgan Freeman with a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWK5ebvtnbw&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;performance of “See You Again” by Wiz Khalifa and Nana Ou-Yang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like me, you might think that this topic is becoming a bit repetitive.  For almost a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007824&quot;&gt;decade&lt;/a&gt; we have seen some improvement in animal research reporting, but it’s not enough, which is why we are still asking the same questions about how we can tackle this issue.  So, what is preventing us from seeing any real progression?  Who is responsible for enforcing greater transparency in animal research – the research institution, the funder, the editor, or the researchers themselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we want to see any real progress in animal research reporting, we must all work together to create solutions that make animal research reporting easier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the answer to this problem lies firmly in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of our hands.  If we want to see any real progress in animal research reporting, we must all work together to create solutions that make animal research reporting easier for not just the researcher, but also for the institution, the funding body, the editor and those that participate in peer review.  We also need to provide better support and training for researchers to raise awareness of these issues more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the topic that was debated during the round table meeting, which heard opinions from institutions, funders, and editors alike.  We agreed that all organizations need to unite so that we can help researchers plan, design and present their research in a manner that can be fully evaluated, utilized and reproduced at the start of their planning – not after.  We need to create a path where one organization passes the “baton” on to the next (institute&amp;gt;funder&amp;gt;journal).  What form this might take is still open to debate, but the idea of creating a universal document which the authors use throughout their research journey proved to be popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we are looking for greater consistency amongst authors, so we need to tackle differences in research culture worldwide, also taking into consideration the language used in our requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would build on the work already achieved by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH), who have created a common set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nih.gov/research-training/rigor-reproducibility/principles-guidelines-reporting-preclinical-research&quot;&gt;Principles and Guidelines in Reporting Preclinical Research&lt;/a&gt; for both publishers and researchers, and that of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/&quot;&gt;Nature research journals&lt;/a&gt;, which have implemented a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/authors/policies/checklist.pdf&quot;&gt;journal level checklist&lt;/a&gt; that focuses on experimental and analytical design elements that ensure robust reporting standards and improve the reproducibility of published results.  Also, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://iclas.org/&quot;&gt;International Committee on Laboratory Animal Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (ICLAS) has created Harmonised Animal Research Reporting Principles (HARRP) for those authors, institutions, and publishers throughout the world for whom setting minimum standards is a priority because current best practice standards seem such a faraway dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research &lt;/em&gt;doing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our efforts, &lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research &lt;/em&gt;is committed to improving the quality of veterinary and animal research reporting, using innovative approaches to peer-review and publication that will encourage more complete reporting, and thus, greater transparency, integrity, and reproducibility of the research we publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We require our authors to adhere to the BMC &lt;a href=&quot;http://resource-cms.springer.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/7117202/data/v2/Minimum+standards+of+reporting+checklist&quot;&gt;Minimum Standards of Reporting&lt;/a&gt; (published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Biology&lt;/em&gt;), in addition to relevant reporting standards, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://meridian.cvm.iastate.edu/arrive/&quot;&gt;ARRIVE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://meridian.cvm.iastate.edu/reflect/&quot;&gt;REFLECT&lt;/a&gt;. The checklist is intended as an aid for authors to clearly, completely and transparently let reviewers and readers know what they did and found.  Authors should upload relevant reporting checklists as supplementary material during submission (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.equator-network.org/&quot;&gt;EQUATOR network&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://meridian.cvm.iastate.edu/&quot;&gt;MERIDIAN&lt;/a&gt; for further guidance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cases where information that is critical to the study may be lacking (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11556&quot;&gt;randomization, blinding, sample size calculation, inclusion/exclusion criteria&lt;/a&gt;, and statistical assessment), we expect authors to acknowledge non-compliance within a limitations section of their manuscript and discuss how these factors may influence the interpretation of their research findings.  We hope this level of transparency will help future researchers build on our published research more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, &lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research &lt;/em&gt;will also be launching a new Study Protocol article type that will enable the reader to compare the protocol to the subsequent research paper to assess possible reporting bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data sharing is also essential to the promotion of transparency and reproducibility. We, therefore, strongly encourage that all datasets are made available to readers, either by deposition of the dataset in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/research-data-policy/repositories/12327124&quot;&gt;publicly available repository&lt;/a&gt; or presented within the main manuscript or additional supporting files wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, &lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research &lt;/em&gt;will also be launching a new Study Protocol article type.  Protocols will allow greater understanding of the scientific rigor of the design and results, but more importantly, will enable the reader to compare the protocol to the subsequent research paper to assess possible reporting bias. By making veterinary protocols publicly available, we hope to improve the transparency of the research process in the veterinary field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we want to collaborate with research institutions and their initiatives to train early career researchers on the various research reporting services available to them – including adherence to reporting standards and the recently launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://norecopa.no/PREPARE&quot;&gt;PREPARE&lt;/a&gt; guidelines.  Working alongside our &lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board&quot;&gt;editorial board&lt;/a&gt;, we hope to visit various institutions and major conferences to provide workshops.  If your institution is interested in hosting such an event, please get in touch by contacting &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:bmcvetres@biomedcentral.com&quot;&gt;bmcvetres@biomedcentral.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have more projects in the pipeline that focus on improving animal research reporting at &lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research&lt;/em&gt;, and we look forward to sharing these with you later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Microaggressions” are seemingly innocuous words or behaviour that supposedly communicate a bias toward minority groups, such as asking Asian Americans where they are from, implying that they are not really part of the USA. According to advocates of the usefulness of the concept, microaggressions cause real harm, even if unintended by the perpetrator. However, the theoretical and evidential support for the concept of microaggressions is far from clear, as detailed in Scott Lilienfeld’s recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/03/16/the-scientific-evidence-for-microaggressions-is-weak-and-we-should-drop-the-term-argues-review-author/&quot;&gt;thorough critique&lt;/a&gt;, which recommended the term be revised or at least re-examined. Now, Craig Harper, a psychologist at Nottingham Trent University, has published a study as &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/973v8/&quot;&gt;a pre-print online at PsyArXiv&lt;/a&gt; that, he argues, reveals a further key problem with the concept of the microaggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33032&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it’s usually defined, a microaggression only counts as such when a &lt;i&gt;majority&lt;/i&gt; group member commits an act that a &lt;i&gt;minority&lt;/i&gt; group member perceives as a slight. The term was coined to account for slights against Black people, and has since expanded to other groups. On his &lt;em&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/em&gt; blog, Derald Sue at Columbia University, one of the originators of the microaggression concept, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/microaggressions-in-everyday-life/201011/microaggressions-more-just-race&quot;&gt;states that&lt;/a&gt; microaggressions are “everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, that … target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership”. For his new study, Craig Harper’s aim was to examine whether it’s true that the experience of “being microaggressed at” really does only flow in one direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harper recruited around 400 US participants online and split them into three groups according to their political beliefs: conservative, liberal, or moderate. They also answered questions about their pride in belonging to their political grouping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants then read six fictional scenarios in which a professor made a contentious claim to his students. For example, in one, a male professor explained that the reason women are under-represented in certain professions is entirely due to their personal choice. A female student then responded in a frustrated manner, but was told by the professor to calm down and that this was not a place for “policy agendas.” This is a fairly typical example of what the literature considers a microaggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the scenarios were balanced so only half the microaggressions targeted people who would normally be seen as victims: women, Black people, and liberals. The other three scenarios kept the topics (such as educational attainment and political diversity), but switched the social identities of the perpetrator and victim. For example, in one case, a female professor justified lower rates of men in certain professions and then showed impatience towards a male student who complained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading each scenario, the participants said whether they thought the student was right to feel insulted or had been overly sensitive. They also said whether they thought the professor was bigoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly perhaps, the students’ own political orientation shaped their response. Harper found that political liberals judged the fictional professors more harshly when they targeted racial minorities, women and those on the political left, compared to other targets. The students with more conservative leanings were less bothered by the scenario content overall, but showed the opposite pattern, being more critical when majorities, men and conservatives were targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harper says this is important because it shows, contrary to the the conventional definition of the microaggression concept, that microaggressions aren’t only experienced by those who fall into certain minority political categories. Instead it seems that anyone who thinks their in-group has been slighted by an out-group member may feel as if they’ve been “microaggressed”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly relevant to one’s sensitivity to potential microaggressions, according to Harper,  is the concept of “collective narcissism” – how much we believe in the superiority of our in-group (typified by agreement with statements like “If people with my political views had a major say in the world, the world would be a much better place”). Based on the participants’ ratings of their pride in their political in-group, there wasn’t any evidence this factor mattered for the liberal groups’ perception of microaggressions. For some of the conservative participants, however, it was those showing more collective narcissism who showed greater sensitivity to slighted right-wing targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding for collective narcissism is tentative at this stage. In fact, Harper’s paper has not yet been peer reviewed and there may be further interpretations of the results that Harper hasn’t considered. But it seems clear that once you are willing to put aside the lens of power to understand microaggressions, you can study the concept like other forms of motivated social cognition we understand quite well, such as, Harper says, the tendency “to shun or discredit those with whom we are ideologically opposed”. These new findings suggest that those who argue microaggressions are a societal concern specifically afflicting minorities may have to recognise that other interest groups – especially in spaces that lean left, not right, like most universities – will have a claim to play the same game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/973v8/&quot;&gt;Political Microaggressions Across the Ideological Spectrum&lt;/a&gt; (note this study is a preprint and has not yet been subjected to peer review)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s widely accepted children’s development reflects an interaction between their genes and the environment they are raised in. More tentative is the intriguing idea that the role of the environment is more consequential for some children than others. According to this view, a minority of children are environmentally sensitive “orchids” who suffer disproportionately in adversity, but who especially thrive in positive conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, research into this idea has been stifled by the lack of a short, reliable test of children’s Environmental Sensitivity. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-42386-001&quot;&gt;reported in &lt;em&gt;Developmental Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a team led by Michael Pluess at Queen Mary University of London has now developed a 12-item scale for this purpose. Preliminary work using the test supports the importance of the Environmental Sensitivity concept and suggests children fall into three groups: orchids; dandelions, who are relatively unaffected by the environment; and tulips, who are midway between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33019&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers started by asking over 300 children aged 11 to 14 years, at a school in East London, to complete an established adult measure of Environmental Sensitivity. Based on the children’s answers, the researchers removed unnecessary items and whittled the measure down to create a “Highly Sensitive Child” (HSC) test that asks children to rate how strongly they agree with the following items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find it unpleasant to have a lot going on at once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some music can make me really happy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I love nice tastes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loud noises make me feel uncomfortable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am annoyed when people try to get me to do too many things at once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I notice it when small things have changed in my environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I get nervous when I have to do a lot in little time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I love nice smells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t like watching TV programs that have a lot of violence in them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t like loud noises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t like it when things change in my life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When someone observes me, I get nervous. This makes me perform worse than normal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers put their new test through its paces, by giving it, together with other personality measures, to  258 more children, aged 11-12 years, also at a school in East London; to 104 children (aged 8-11 years) at two London primary schools, who took the new test twice, several weeks apart; and to nearly 1,500 teenagers from across England and Wales, aged 15-19 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from these tests showed that like the adult version of the test, the new test appears to tap three separate factors (Aesthetic sensitivity; Ease of Excitation; and Low Sensory Threshold) that correlate and contribute to a general trait of Environmental Sensitivity. Importantly, Environmental Sensitivity appeared to be distinct from other traits already established in psychology, such as trait Neuroticism (or emotional instability). There was also notable stability in their Environmental Sensitivity scores when children took the test twice, weeks apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a final analysis, the researchers combined all their data and looked to see whether the distribution of Environmental Sensitivity scores supported the idea that a minority of children are orchids, while the majority are “dandelions” and less sensitive to the environment, positive or negative. In fact, the new data suggested that scores tend to fall into three groupings, with roughly 30 per cent of children matching the environmentally sensitive “orchid” category, 30 per cent being “dandelions” and showing a distinct lack of Environmental Sensitivity, and the remainder being “tulips”, midway between the two other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research is need to test the reality of these categories and how they differ from each other, or whether it might actually be more accurate to see variation in Environmental Sensitivity as an unbroken continuum. It will also be interesting to see whether and how patterns of Environmental Sensitivity vary across cultures, and what are the factors that influence a child’s score on the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s already exciting from a practical and theoretical perspective, though, is that early research (conducted separately from the current study) using the new Highly Sensitive Child test, suggests that Environmental Sensitivity is a meaningful concept with important implications. For instance, a long-term study in the US of juvenile offenders (currently unpublished) found that risk of re-offending was more strongly related to quality of the home environment, good and bad, among those who scored high on Environmental Sensitivity. Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-51819-001&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; found that both positive and negative parenting styles were more consequential for children rated higher by their parents on Environmental Sensitivity (using an adapted version of the new HSC test).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Environmental Sensitivity is an important individual characteristic that is related to, but largely distinct from, other common temperament and personality traits,” the researchers said. “The current study suggests that it is possible to measure Environmental Sensitivity reliably in children and adolescents with the Highly Sensitive Child scale, a 12-item self-report measure with good psychometric properties.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-42386-001&quot;&gt;Environmental sensitivity in children: Development of the Highly Sensitive Child Scale and identification of sensitivity groups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/cleaning-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Household activities are a core part of the daily lives of retirees. Previous work has found that this population devotes more time to housework activities than their working spouses and this has become more pronounced since the increase in life expectancy and subsequently the increase in time spent not working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, men tend to still avoid the washing up, even post retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9750 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/garden-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;In their study just published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, researchers at &lt;em&gt;Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Bremen&lt;/em&gt; found notable differences between the type of housework men and women spent time on. Across all countries included in this study, men spent less time cleaning, cooking and shopping than women (88.7 minutes a day compared to 217.9 minutes a day). However, women were found to spend less time on gardening and maintenance tasks than men (38.5 minutes a day compared to 68.8 minutes a day). This supports previous work which shows that women are more likely to engage in routine, every-day chores compared to their spouses who are more involved in occasional tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors also carried out a cross-country comparison among Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, France, the Netherlands and the US. They found that elderly women in Italy and Germany spent the most time on housework (around five hours a day), while women in the US spent the least amount of time doing housework (four hours a day). In contrast, elderly men in Italy spent the least amount of time on housework (2.7 hours a day) and German men spent the most time on housework (4.2 hours a day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While those who did more housework felt healthier, women who did long hours of housework combined with too much or too little sleep reported poorer health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With sleep constituting the lengthiest time use activity among the elderly, the authors also set out to address to what extent the association between housework activities and health is moderated by sleep hours among men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this, the study used self-reported data from 15,333 men and 20,907 women aged 65 years and over from Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, France, the Netherlands and the US. Participants reported the total time they spent per day on 41 activities in 5, 10 or 15-minute intervals. They also reported the total amount of time they spent sleeping per day, as well as whether they felt they were in poor, fair, good or very good health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While those who did more housework felt healthier, women who did long hours of housework combined with too much or too little sleep reported poorer health.  Conversely, for men, long hours of housework was associated with good health status regardless of sleep duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following excerpt from &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/night-call-9780190669638&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Night Call&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, acclaimed psychologist  and author Robert Wicks details a five-day guide to self-care designed to fit even the busiest of schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day one: savor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; alone time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time alone or within ourselves— “alone time”—needs to be appreciated in the broadest sense (not just in the extreme where someone goes off by him- or-herself to an isolated spot) in the living opportunities that present themselves during our current normal daily routines. When alone time is appreciated, explored, and enjoyed in the right way, we can lessen our projections, become easier on ourselves, and decrease our discouragement when immediate gratification or success isn’t granted. Instead, we may feel a sense of inner ease and intrigue about the life we can live that is before us right now rather than constantly being postponed into some uncertain future. As we can see in the following reflection by Christopher Peterson, the author of &lt;em&gt;A Primer in Positive Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, life need not, should not, be postponed— even for apparently practical reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many academics, I spent my young adult years post­poning many of the small things that I knew would make me happy, including reading novels for pleasure, learning to cook, taking a photography class, and joining a gym. I would do all of these things when I had time— when I fin­ished school, when I was awarded tenure, and so on. I was fortunate enough to realize that I would never have time unless I made the time. And then the rest of my life began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day two: replenishing yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seeds of &lt;em&gt;secondary &lt;/em&gt;stress (the pressures experienced in reaching out to others in distress) and the seeds of true pas­sionate involvement are actually the &lt;em&gt;same &lt;/em&gt;seeds&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Once again, the question is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;whether stress will appear and take a toll on those seeking to be compassionate and caring. Instead, it is to what extent we take the essential steps to appreciate, limit, and learn from this very stress to continue— and even deepen— our personal lives and roles as helpers and healers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To renew themselves on an ongoing basis, there are basic elements of a self-care protocol that most everyone needs. Some of the basic elements might include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiet walks by yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time and space for meditation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spiritual and recreational reading, including the diaries and biographies of others whom you admire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some light exercise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunities to laugh offered by movies, cheerful friends, and so forth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hobby, such as gardening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phone calls to family and friends who inspire and tease you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Involvement in projects that renew&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listening to music you enjoy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day three: debriefing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For therapists and counselors, a daily review or self-debriefing helps them get in touch with the feelings they have had in their treatment sessions. They seek to discover if their intense encounters with the persons they serve triggered dis­torted thoughts and beliefs. By looking at their own reactions, they not only learn things about themselves but also appreciate the people and situations they encounter in new ways. Such a review would benefit all of us even if we are not in the helping or healing professions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more detail the process of a structured reflection or self-debriefing, which could be modified according to individual needs, includes the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick events during the day that stand out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter into the event and describe what happened (the objective) and how you feel (the subjective)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid the temptation to be discouraged, blame others (projection) or yourself (self- condemnation); instead, see what you can learn from the event about yourself and your vulnerabilities, needs, addictions, fears, anxieties, worries, and desires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on these insights in light of what you believe (your philosophy, psychology, ethics, and/ or spirituality)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide how these insights should change you personally, interpersonally, and professionally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alter the way you behave in light of these new insights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day four: attending to mindlessness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we see and embrace mindfulness in an ongoing way, not only do we benefit, but those who we reach out to in life do as well. For example, it allows us to be more perceptive concerning what is present in ourselves and others without judgment so we can experience situations more fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this in reflecting on our lives or in medi­tation, we need to approach ourselves with no preconceived notions of what will happen or a “gaining idea” in our minds as to something we wish to achieve. Consequently, recogniz­ing the following types of mindless behavior and attitudes as persons wishing to honor our caregiving roles as well as the need of self-compassion is a good beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting too easily upset—often over the wrong things (fail­ing to be successful even after we have been faithful to doing what we can) and missing what life is offering us in all inter­actions and events (an opportunity to learn from our reac­tions and as well as information from outside ourselves)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeing interruptions only as disruptive rather than as infor­mative or possible, unexpected opportunities to see or expe­rience something new and differently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possessing habits and rules that continue to sap life’s freshness for us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spending too much time in the silver casket of nostalgia or rushing through precious moments of our lives under the impression that living this way is “only practical” and temporary, although these “temporaries” can link together to form a lifetime of mindlessness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only fantasizing about both “the spirit of simplicity” and “letting go” rather than seeking to instill them in our own lives in real, concrete ways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day five: friendship and journeys in letting go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us go through periods when we feel left by ourselves, without “friendly forces” to help us gain perspective and know we are worthwhile, competent, secure, and (maybe most of all) understood. Margaret Mead, the famous anthropolo­gist once said that “one of the oldest human needs is having someone to wonder where you are when you don’t come home at night.” Sometimes friendship implodes our sense of “lost­ness” during a dramatic event in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letting go means catching ourselves in the act of holding on to a feeling or reaction that is not from a good place within ourselves. A psychotherapist once shared with me, “When I find myself being tempted to be small-minded or mean-spirited, I remind myself of the invitation to be magnanimous, where I find my better self.” This better self is one that is more open, one that doesn’t deny difficulties but also doesn’t see things in polarities of right and wrong or good and bad. The better self is able to be receptive to a richer and more nuanced experience of life, and this is certainly a place where friendship can support such an attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

It's quite a leap from watching a video of women in differing attire, comparing levels of empathy when “objectified” vs. “personalized” women are excluded from the game, and actually perpetrating violence against women in the real world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZG3yADRcqRY/WlXsCI0ct8I/AAAAAAAAMZw/i_eaOkYzOY08DX4rELzfoEtp58w50C-FQCLcBGAs/s1600/Fig1_Cogoni_objectified%2Bor%2Bnot.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;650&quot; data-original-width=&quot;852&quot; height=&quot;305&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZG3yADRcqRY/WlXsCI0ct8I/AAAAAAAAMZw/i_eaOkYzOY08DX4rELzfoEtp58w50C-FQCLcBGAs/s400/Fig1_Cogoni_objectified%2Bor%2Bnot.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;modified from Fig. 1 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945217304045&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cogoni et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;(A) &lt;/b&gt;objectified women in little black dresses; &lt;b&gt;(B)&lt;/b&gt; personalized women in pants and t-shirt. &lt;i&gt;Note&lt;/i&gt;: the black bar didn't appear in the actual videos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not a social psychologist (so I've always been a bit skeptical), but &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberball.wikispaces.com/&quot;&gt;Cyberball&lt;/a&gt; is a virtual game designed as a model for social rejection and ostracism (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11079239&quot;&gt;Williams et al., 2000&lt;/a&gt;). The participant is led to believe they are playing an online  ball-tossing game with other people, who then proceed to exclude them  from the game. It's been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=cyberball&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;widely used&lt;/a&gt; to study exclusion, social pain, and empathy for another's person's pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-35V4DTo7ZbI/UKKOqnGZI4I/AAAAAAAAHOc/Uld4gAL6Amk/s1600/AnimatedCyberball.gif&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot; title=&quot;Cyberball animated gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;142&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-35V4DTo7ZbI/UKKOqnGZI4I/AAAAAAAAHOc/Uld4gAL6Amk/s320/AnimatedCyberball.gif&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The present version went beyond this simple animation and used 15&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot; data-hveid=&quot;59&quot; data-ved=&quot;0ahUKEwjnzMOup83YAhVRzmMKHWZwDWgQ4EUIOzAB&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;21 second videos (see still image in Fig. 1) with the “self” condition represented by a pair of hands.

But ultimately, culture and social conditions and power differentials (all outside the brain) are the major determinants of violence against women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DyADFjADJ0o/WlXtKswqkkI/AAAAAAAAMZ8/8vTT_PD9HGMaqNjen98vhPJ6KH4v0lZwwCLcBGAs/s1600/Abuse%2Bof%2BPower%2BComes%2BAs%2BNo%2BSurprise.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;269&quot; data-original-width=&quot;444&quot; height=&quot;193&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DyADFjADJ0o/WlXtKswqkkI/AAAAAAAAMZ8/8vTT_PD9HGMaqNjen98vhPJ6KH4v0lZwwCLcBGAs/s320/Abuse%2Bof%2BPower%2BComes%2BAs%2BNo%2BSurprise.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~field/holzer/truisms.txt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Truisms&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.jennyholzer.com/projections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jenny Holzer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When discussing the objectification of women in the present era, it's hard to escape the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/10/27/weinstein-scandal-complete-list-accusers/804663001/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;84 accusers!!&quot;&gt;Harvey Weinstein scandal&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Terror attacks by Muslim extremists tend to provoke hate crimes in response. After the London Bridge and Borough market attacks in 2017, and the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, for example, there was a spike in the number of reports of verbal and physical attacks on innocent Muslims. Two weeks after the London Bridge attacks, a British non-Muslim man even drove his van into worshippers leaving the Finsbury Park Mosque in London, killing one and injuring 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People have a tendency to hold groups collectively responsible for the actions of individual group members, which justifies ‘vicarious retribution’ against any group member to exact revenge,” note the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217744197&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/i&gt; that explores how to short-circuit this cycle of violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what the researchers dub an “interventions tournament”, they tried out various methods of reducing the collective blaming of all Muslims for attacks by individual extremists. Most failed. But there was one clear winner: an intervention that encouraged non-Muslims to see the hypocrisy in blaming all Muslims for the appalling actions of a few individuals, but not all Christians for the violent actions of an extremist few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33010&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Bruneau at the University of Pennsylvania led the work, beginning with a study of the importance of collective blaming, involving 193 mostly white, Christian Americans, recruited online. As they predicted, the researchers found that those participants who held Muslims collectively responsible for the terror attacks in Paris in November 2015 were also more likely to endorse a suite of anti-Muslim attitudes and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers selected eight 2-4 minute-long videos containing different psychological “elements” that might help reduce the belief in collective blame. For example, one of the videos highlighted the diversity of the Muslim experience – challenging the idea that “all Muslims are the same”. Two videos depicted non-Muslim Americans demonstrating that they do not hold Muslims collectively responsible for terror incidents – by donating to a vandalised mosque, for example. This kind of “social proof” has been shown in other studies to strongly influence behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,765 non-Muslim Americans watched one of these eight videos, or no video (as a control), or a “negative control” – a video interview with a Syrian-born woman who attacked Islam as backward and violent. This video was expected to &lt;i&gt;increase&lt;/i&gt; collective blame, and the analysis showed that it did – highlighting, the researchers write, the potential danger of anti-Muslim rhetoric by politicians and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one video reduced collective blame. This was an Al Jazeera interview with a Muslim American woman who highlighted the hypocrisy of holding all Muslims collectively responsible for extremist violence. Specifically, she discussed the tendency by Christians to blame all Muslims for terror attacks, but not to blame all Christians for violent acts by extremist individual Christians. After watching this video, participants not only saw Muslims as less collectively responsible for extremism, but also showed less anti-Muslim prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test whether the key ingredient of this video was the way it highlighted hypocrisy, the researchers asked more participants to reflect on their own (and White people’s) &lt;i&gt;lack&lt;/i&gt; of collective responsibility for the actions of extreme individual group members, and they found this also lowered belief in the collective blame of Muslims, as well as reducing anti-Muslim prejudice, attitudes and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting, of course, to know how long the effects of a hypocrisy intervention might last in the real world. But, as the researchers note in their conclusion, the findings “contribute to a long tradition of research demonstrating that highlighting hypocrisy can drive behaviour change”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217744197&quot;&gt;Interventions Highlighting Hypocrisy Reduce Collective Blame of Muslims for Individual Acts of Violence and Assuage Anti-Muslim Hostility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a question that goes to the heart of human nature – do our personalities change through life or stay essentially the same? You might think psychology would have a definitive answer, but this remains an active research question. This is partly because of the practical challenge of testing the same group of individuals over many years. Now a major new contribution to the topic has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/ryjpc/&quot;&gt;made available online at the PsyArXiv repository&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers, led by Eileen Graham at Northwestern University, have compared and combined data from 14 previously published longitudinal studies, together involving nearly 50,000 participants from the US, Europe and Scandinavia. Their findings confirm and extend existing knowledge, showing how personality traits tend to change through life in predictable ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33002&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham and her colleagues started by looking for existing long-term studies into health and ageing that had captured data on at least one of the Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) on at least three separate occasions among the same sample of people. Although these long-term term studies measured personality, previous investigators hadn’t necessarily looked at this aspect of their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the identified studies that met the required criteria were the Einstein Aging Study, the Midlife in the United States study, The Berlin Aging Study, The Lothian Birth Cohort and the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging. In some cases, personality data was collected from the same individuals over several decades. There was a bias in the included studies toward testing people late in life, but this helps counterbalance existing studies of lifetime personality change which have been skewed toward younger participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining data from all the studies showed that four of the five main personality traits showed statistically significant change, on average, through life, thus contradicting William James’ famous assertion that personality is set like plaster after age 30. The exception was trait Agreeableness (related to warmth and empathy), but actually this trait was found to change in each individual study, but in different directions for different studies (sometimes increasing through life, sometimes diminishing), such that it appeared stable when considered in aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting Agreeableness aside, the overall pattern was for the other traits to decline across the lifespan by about 1-2 per cent per decade, such that participants became, on average, more emotionally stable (save for an uptick in Neuroticism at the very end of life), but generally less outgoing, less open-minded, and less orderly and self-disciplined. This is somewhat consistent with the previously described Dolce Vita (literally “sweet life”) effect, which describes how we change in late life in response to having fewer responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s worth reiterating that there was a bias in the included studies towards older samples. Focusing on just those studies with younger participants also provided evidence for early life increases in Conscientiousness, Extraversion and Openness (with peaks occurring in mid-life), which is consistent with another established theory known as the “maturity principle”, which states that our personalities tend to improve through life as we adapt to the growing challenges of work and family responsibilities (the observed declines in Neuroticism also fit this picture).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember these findings relate to sample averages, based on how personality trait levels were seen to change when data from all participants was combined. Consistent with past research, results from 12 of the 14 analysed studies revealed a good deal of individual variation in these patterns. As Graham and her colleagues put it, “not everyone changes at the same rate, or in the same direction”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also some intriguing hints at how these personality dynamics might vary across cultures. Specifically, the US samples showed more marked and consistent declines in Extraversion through life compared with European samples. The researchers interpreted this as US citizens becoming less inclined with age to conform to the strong pressure in American culture to behave like an extravert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings leave many questions about personality change unanswered, such as why some people show trait changes that don’t fit with the usual pattern. However, this paper’s most important contribution is probably to show how sub-fields like this, which depend on challenging, hard-to-repeat, long-term studies, can respond to the so-called replication crisis in psychology. It’s fairly easy to re-run a simple laboratory task with students, it’s much harder to try to replicate the findings of a decades-long personality change study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any one of the 14 samples used here could have comprised a publication on its own,” Graham and her colleagues explained, “with some claiming a given increase, other claiming a decrease, and still others arguing that a trait does not change at all. This has the potential to sow great confusion … However, when considered as a group with other samples, a fuller picture emerges.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/01/PLOS_fMRI-2-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional MRI (fMRI) is one of the most celebrated tools in neuroscience. Because of their unique ability to peer directly into the living brain while an organism thinks, feels and behaves, fMRI studies are often devoted disproportionate media attention, replete with flashy headlines and often grandiose claims. However, the technique has come under a fair amount of criticism from researchers questioning the validity of the statistical methods used to analyze fMRI data, and hence the reliability of fMRI findings. Can we trust those flashy headlines claiming that “scientists have discovered the &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;insert political affiliation, emotion or personality trait&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt; area of the brain,” or are the masses of fMRI studies plagued by statistical shortcomings? To explore why these studies can be vulnerable to experimental failure, in their new &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0184923&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS One study&lt;/a&gt; coauthors Henk Cremers, Tor Wager and Tal Yarkoni investigated common statistical issues encountered in typical fMRI studies, and proposed how to avert them moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FMRI simulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reliability of any experiment depends on adequate power to detect real effects and reject spurious ones, which can be influenced by various factors including the sample size (or number of “subjects” in fMRI), how strong the real effect is (“effect size”), whether comparisons are within or between subjects, and the statistical threshold used. To characterize common statistical culprits of fMRI studies, Cremers and colleagues first simulated typical fMRI scenarios before validating these simulations on a real dataset. One scenario simulated weak but diffusely distributed brain activity, and the other scenario simulated strong but localized brain activity (Figure 1). The simulation revealed that effect sizes are generally inflated for weak diffuse, compared to strong localized, activations, especially when the sample size is small. In contrast, effect sizes can actually be &lt;em&gt;underestimated&lt;/em&gt; for strong localized scenarios when the sample size is large. Thus, more isn’t always better when it comes to fMRI; the optimal sample size likely depends on the specific brain-behavior relationship under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_19500&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/01/WD_SL_Cremers2017.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-19500 size-large&quot; height=&quot;246&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/01/WD_SL_Cremers2017-1024x246.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;. Example “weak diffuse” and “strong localized” fMRI activations. Adapted from Cremers et al., 2017.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real data application: Human Connectome Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Cremers and colleagues analyzed a real fMRI dataset of nearly 500 subjects performing a social cognition task collected through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Human Connectome Project&lt;/a&gt;. To represent typical fMRI studies, random samples of 15 subjects were drawn to assess within-subject effects, and random samples of 30 subjects were used for between-subjects analyses. Results from these examples were compared to data from the full sample of 500 subjects—a rough proxy for true effects. Similar to the simulation, effect sizes negatively correlated with sample size, decreasing as the sample size grew. Because within-subject contrasts are by nature higher-powered, and because of the strong brain-behavior effect analyzed, real within-subject activations were readily detected even with the small sample of 15 individuals, resembling the simulated “strong localized” effects. In contrast, between-subject effects, even with twice the sample size, were unreliable and inflated, closely resembling the simulated “weak diffuse” scenario (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_19501&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/01/WD_examples_2017.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-19501 size-full&quot; height=&quot;499&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/01/WD_examples_2017.png&quot; width=&quot;930&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt;. Eight random subsamples of data (N = 30) from the Human Connectome Project, showing unreliable between-subject activations. Adapted from Cremers et al., 2017.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings offer a few key take-away lessons. Underpowered studies can result in grossly overestimated effects and inconsistent activations, leading to an inability to replicate results. In part driven by a common fear of Type I errors (false positives), many studies miss legitimate effects and thus encourage incomplete or inaccurate inferences about brain-behavior relationships. Wager underscores that these pitfalls aren’t entirely unique to fMRI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having a healthy skepticism applies to most areas of science—genetics, animal models of disorders, psychology, and much more—not just fMRI. And I think skepticism should be &lt;em&gt;healthy&lt;/em&gt; skepticism—we can get provisionally excited about published ideas, and more excited about them as they pass the test of time and begin to be replicated across more groups. Publishing an exploratory finding that may not be true is not wrong, if you’ve made a good faith attempt to get at the truth—we just have to have patience and not ‘over-believe’ until the evidence comes in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding statistical pitfalls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can a neuroscientist do to adequately power their fMRI experiment to detect true effects while minimizing false or unreliable effects? A power analysis using realistic parameter estimates to compute the necessary sample size is a critical first step. Unfortunately, the requisite sample of fMRI data may be prohibitive in terms of time and money for an individual researcher without access to large datasets. The growing trend in “big data” may partially address this problem, but, as Wager explains, “it’s even more important to have ‘smart data.’ Large datasets can produce spurious results with high confidence in many cases where hidden causes are not properly accounted for. Smart data means careful sampling and analysis to improve inferences about what the real causes of effects are.” Once the data have been collected, a researcher can optimize their analysis by selecting the right balance between Type I (false positives) and Type II (false negatives) errors, which largely depends on the unique study scenario. Finally, the number of statistical comparisons can be limited by employing hypothesis-driven testing or by taking advantage of machine-learning, graph theory, or data reduction approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A movement to standardize fMRI methods has recently emerged, propelled by papers including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/files/2016/COBIDASreport.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the OHBM Committee on Best Practice in Data Analysis and Sharing (COBIDAS) on MRI&lt;/a&gt; and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18191585&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Guidelines for reporting an fMRI study&lt;/a&gt;.” According to Cremers, such efforts are “indeed essential, since there are so many choices to make when it comes to data acquisition and analyses. Also, initiatives like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/functional-mri&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Coursera fMRI course&lt;/a&gt; of Lindquist and Tor, are great and very important—they make the principles of fMRI research accessible to a wide audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
