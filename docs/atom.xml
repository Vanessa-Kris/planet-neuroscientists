 This post might turn into a collaborative research project. If you're a data person, or an experimental psychologist interested in this, get in touch. I'd love to see if we can't formalize this idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2013/mar/05/heimlich/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent (excellent) Radiolab episode&lt;/a&gt; about the strange, unproven ideas of Henry Heimlich (of Heimlich maneuver fame)--along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/07/the-vitamin-myth-why-we-think-we-need-supplements/277947/?1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this Atlantic article&lt;/a&gt; about Linus Pauling's ideas about vitamin mega-dosing as a cancer cure--got me thinking about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Nobel_disease&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Nobel Disease&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and the effect that early successes could have on people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to that link:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;The Nobel disease is a term used to describe a phenomenon in which Nobel Prize-winning scientists endorse or perform &quot;research&quot; in pseudoscientific areas in their later years. In reality, this &quot;disease&quot; most likely demonstrates that even the most brilliant people are not immune to crank ideas and belief in such ideas will persist to some degree even among Nobelists. It also makes for a convenient argument from authority for lesser cranks, because if a Nobel Prize-winning scientist says it, it must be true!&lt;/blockquote&gt;As we know, we humans are &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;susceptible to misconceptions, logical fallacies, and biases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if people who are &lt;i&gt;exceptionally&lt;/i&gt; successful from an early age are biased into thinking that they're less fallible, at the exclusion of taking advice and/or criticism, while simultaneously their &lt;i&gt;incredible&lt;/i&gt; success paralyzes other people from offering criticism?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put that another way, what I'm calling the &quot;Prodigy Effect&quot; is a two-way cognitive bias wherein one gives their own innate abilities undue positive weight with regards to their early success in a domain (business, art, science, etc.) which at the same time makes others reluctant to offer criticism. This seems like a mix of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot-hand_fallacy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hot-hand fallacy&lt;/a&gt;, some kind of &quot;beginner's luck&quot; bias, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler's_fallacy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gambler's fallacy&lt;/a&gt;, with a dose of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;self-serving bias&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_of_silence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spiral of silence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hot-hand fallacy was made famous by &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4788541579061542217&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0,5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the 1985 &lt;i&gt;Cognitive Psychology&lt;/i&gt; paper&lt;/a&gt; by Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky, &quot;The hot hand in basketball: On the misperception of random sequences&quot;. Basically, this fallacy is one wherein someone who has had an early success at something believes they have a greater chance of success at future tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the first things that came to mind about this idea was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/m-night-shymalan-movies-keep-getting-worse-2013-6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this chart&lt;/a&gt; about M. Night Shyamalan's moving ratings over time. Each successive movie is essentially rated more poorly than the last:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mmy6LIiFiY8/UgFH0KY1adI/AAAAAAAAFhE/UGCVXQ-8hD4/s1600/m-night-movie-popularity.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mmy6LIiFiY8/UgFH0KY1adI/AAAAAAAAFhE/UGCVXQ-8hD4/s1600/m-night-movie-popularity.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or this review of &lt;i&gt;Star Wars: The Phantom Menace &lt;/i&gt;(jump to 4:55) about people not calling out George Lucas on some bad ideas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Shyamalan and Lucas had &lt;i&gt;crazy&lt;/i&gt; successes with &lt;i&gt;The Sixth Sense&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Star Wars: A New Hope&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. But the subsequent movies that they directed were widely regarded as pretty awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But of course, these are anecdotes, and what counts is data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first idea was to take a look at the list of those who have fallen prey to the &quot;Nobel Disease&quot; and to look at their ages compared to the average age of other Nobelists. The hypothesis is that those who are &quot;Nobel Diseased&quot; would be, on average, much younger when they won their first Nobel than the average Nobelist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelmedia/nobelprize_org/developer/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nobel Prize website has an API&lt;/a&gt; that provides these data, which I've cleaned and organized &lt;a href=&quot;http://darb.ketyov.com/professional/publications/nobel_disease.zip&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. That file also includes the MATLAB script I used to analyze the data. For people with multiple Nobel prizes, I took their age at their first win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found was that those 14 people who are classified as having the &quot;Nobel Disease&quot; were, on average, &lt;i&gt;8.4 years younger &lt;/i&gt;when they won their first Nobel Prize compared to &quot;normal&quot; Nobelists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m7gaU2y2iFQ/UgFQpS84zII/AAAAAAAAFhU/dwCrqHCq9do/s1600/nobel_disease.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;234&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m7gaU2y2iFQ/UgFQpS84zII/AAAAAAAAFhU/dwCrqHCq9do/s320/nobel_disease.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is significant using a two-way &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011) and using resampling methods (1000 surrogate group reassignments, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd love to do the same analysis on the ratings difference between a director's first film and subsequent films, with the idea that directors who have an early huge hit would then have more poorly-rated future films, but I don't have time to dig into &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Rotten Tomatoes API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hypothesis could also be tested in an experimental psychology setup, though I don't quite have an idea for the experimental design yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, interesting stuff regardless, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'd like to help, let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;float: left; padding: 5px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.researchblogging.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;ResearchBlogging.org&quot; src=&quot;http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Z3988&quot; title=&quot;ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Cognitive+Psychology&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1016%2F0010-0285%2885%2990010-6&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=The+hot+hand+in+basketball%3A+On+the+misperception+of+random+sequences&amp;amp;rft.issn=&amp;amp;rft.date=1985&amp;amp;rft.volume=&amp;amp;rft.issue=&amp;amp;rft.spage=&amp;amp;rft.epage=&amp;amp;rft.artnum=&amp;amp;rft.au=T+Gilovich%2C+R+Vallone%2C+A+Tversky&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Psychology%2CSocial+Science&quot;&gt;T Gilovich, R Vallone, A Tversky (1985).

 &lt;p&gt;What is genetic basis of our intelligence? How to stimulate deep areas of the brain? How to prevent Alzheimer’s disease?  How to slash the cost of treatment of multiple sclerosis? These are some of the questions highlighted in this monthly review of research literature. As usual, while we answer some questions, research studies also dispel some myths and assumption. Whether positive or negative,  the findings always help us to advance further our knowledge of brain and its abilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, we marked the birthday of Stanley Prusiner, the discoverer of prions – self-replicating proteins behind many neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Recognising the importance of prions finally put the research aimed at finding the cure for these conditions on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE BEST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New genes for intelligence identified&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence is highly heritable: it is estimated that 80% of our intelligence in adulthood is explained by genetic factors. However, our knowledge of specific genes involved in intelligence is very limited. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3869.html&quot;&gt;New study&lt;/a&gt; published this month and based on the analysis of genetic data from 78,000 individuals reported 52 genes associated with &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/22/is-there-an-association-between-brain-size-and-intelligence/&quot;&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, 40 of which are completely novel. Interestingly, many of these genes are also involved in determining other traits such as obesity, BMI, depressive syndromes, Alzheimer’s disease and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain region responsible for the fear of uncertain future is identified&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people find it difficult to cope with an uncertain future. Surprisingly, it turned out that this particular behavioural feature closely relates to the size of one specific part of the brain – the striatum. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/emo-emo0000331.pdf&quot;&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that a larger striatum is typically seen in people who have troubles dealing with uncertainties.  The study was done on psychologically healthy individuals, but an enlarged striatum has also been reported to be associated with general anxiety disorder and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2013/07/13/multifaceted-causes-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/&quot;&gt;obsessive compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt;.  Researchers speculate that an enlarged striatum may be linked to a higher risk of developing these disorders later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-invasive method of stimulating deep parts of brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/29/personality-changes-after-deep-brain-stimulation/&quot;&gt;stimulation&lt;/a&gt; of deep parts of the brain has proven to be beneficial in treating a number of brain disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, obsessive compulsive disorder, epilepsy, and depression. However, the approach requires implanting of an electrode directly inside the brain, which involves a risky and costly surgery. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(17)30584-6.pdf&quot;&gt;new technique &lt;/a&gt;reported this month avoids this problem by using a pair of electrodes located on the surface of the scalp. The method relies on the use of a phenomenon known as temporal interference. This techniques allows the targeted delivery of electrical stimulation to deep areas of brain, such as hippocampus, without stimulating the surface brain area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New cheap treatment for multiple sclerosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic minocycline, traditionally used as an acne medicine, may provide a safe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1608889&quot;&gt;new method &lt;/a&gt;of treating &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/13/how-temperature-affects-people-with-multiple-sclerosis/&quot;&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS), at a fraction of current cost of treating this disease. This drug was developed over 50 years ago. It attracted the attention of researchers studying MS due to its spectrum of anti-inflammatory activities. Phase III trials demonstrated that minocycline slows the progress of disease in patients diagnosed during the early stages of MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNA-based vaccine for Alzheimer’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite our growing understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the development of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/17/alzheimers-disease-now-you-see-it/&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, we still have no single treatment that could cure this condition or stop its progression. An earlier attempt to develop a vaccine preventing the development of Alzheimer’s disease has also failed due to severe side effects. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-017-0257-7&quot;&gt;new article&lt;/a&gt; published this month reports a new promising DNA-based vaccine that inhibits the accumulation of amyloid proteins in animals and shows no side effects observed in previous trials. It remains to be seen if these effects can be reproduced in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood-brain barrier and omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are well known for their positive effects on general health. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/neuron/comments/S0896-6273(17)30287-8&quot;&gt;Recent findings&lt;/a&gt; demonstrate that these compounds are critical players in maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, the key structure for protecting the brain from various pathogens and toxins. Moreover, researchers demonstrated that permeability of the blood-brain barrier can be regulated by suppressing a protein that transports &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/16/nurturing-the-brain-part-7-omega-3-fatty-acids/&quot;&gt;omega-3 acids&lt;/a&gt; to blood vessel cells. Making the barrier more penetrable is advantageous for efficient delivery of drugs when treating patients with various brain disorders.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;THE WORST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No stress relief from high doses of tetrahydrocannabinol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users of cannabis often claim that they use the drug for relaxation and stress relief. More detailed&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drugandalcoholdependence.com/article/S0376-8716(17)30220-X/fulltext&quot;&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; of this effect shows a mixed picture. While experimenting with different doses of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major active substance in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/05/13/debunking-the-myths-of-marijuana-withdrawal-syndrome/&quot;&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt;, researchers found that small doses of the compound do indeed reduce stress. However, a slightly higher doses (sufficient to produce a mild “high”) produce an opposite effect and increase anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual cortex develops and matures much slower than assumed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is traditionally believed that our visual system, including the parts of brain involved in the analysis of visual information, matures within the first few years of life. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2017/05/29/JNEUROSCI.2304-16.2017&quot;&gt;new article&lt;/a&gt; published this month demonstrates that this assumption is incorrect. Visual cortex continues developing till the late 30s – early 40s. The authors of the article speculate that other parts of the brain may also reach maturity much later in life than currently assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcranial direct-current stimulation  does not enhance cognitive training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct-current stimulation () is increasingly used as a method of improving learning abilities. The technique relies on passing weak electric impulses to the brain via electrodes attached to the scalp. Despite the growing popularity of this technique, the evidence in support of its advantages are very limited. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617698139&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published this month casts further doubt on any benefits provided by &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/03/05/tcds-a-therapy-for-the-future/&quot;&gt;tDCS&lt;/a&gt;. The author reported no improvements of working memory in a large group of subjects using this method, as compared to controls. Furthermore, the analysis of the existing literature on the subject also does not provide any meaningful support to the method. Clearly, further research on tDCS should be done to confirm or rule out the existence of its effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor sense of smell in humans is a misconception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The superiority of animals sense of smell compared to humans appears to be obvious to most people. After all, we do rely on a dog’s sense of smell for hunting, and it is well known how quickly sharks can detect the slightest smell of blood. However, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6338/eaam7263&quot;&gt;new article&lt;/a&gt; published this month in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; attempts to dispel the view that the human ability to detect smells is as bad as we are used to thinking. The number of brain cells involved in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/10/03/smell-your-age/&quot;&gt;smell&lt;/a&gt; detection in humans is almost the same as in animals, and it is estimated that we can distinguish up to one trillion of different odors. We may lack the degree of specialization demonstrated by many animals in interpreting the information obtained through olfactory system, but the human ability to recognize smells is definitely much stronger than we are accustomed to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women are not better than men at face recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is commonly assumed that women are better  at recognizing and reading faces and correctly interpreting facial expressions. However, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://eneuro.org/content/early/2017/04/26/ENEURO.0104-17.2017&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published this month casts serious doubts on this assumption. Using a series of tests, scientists demonstrated that no detectable difference in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/17/how-the-brain-recognizes-faces/&quot;&gt;facial recognition&lt;/a&gt; exists between two genders. Importantly, the neuroimaging of the areas of brain known to be involved in face recognition has shown identical neural activity in both men and women when they were watching a video clip featuring multiple familiar and non-familiar faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercising self-control leaves you feeling drained. That’s what many of us in the West believe and it’s what we seem to experience – think of the fatigue after a morning spent dealing with difficult clients or focused on spreadsheets on a computer screen. But in Indian culture, there is a widespread belief that mental effort is energising – that the more concentration and self-control you expend in one situation, the more invigorated you will feel for the next challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology has, so far, mostly backed up our Western intuitions. Over 100 studies – nearly all conducted in the West – have shown that participants are less able to resist temptation or exercise mental focus after completing a mentally taxing task, an effect that researchers call “ego depletion”. But now &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-24735-001/&quot;&gt;a paper in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has tested Indian participants and it shows for the first time a “reverse ego-depletion effect” – the more difficult an initial mental task, the better participants performed on a subsequent challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24854&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belief in the benefits of exercising self-control permeates Indian Culture. Children are taught concentration techniques, such as focusing on a candle flame in a dark room. Regular prayers and meditation are widely encouraged. It’s a cultural view that appears to manifest in education: Indian children have longer class times and spend more time on homework than American children; Indian students spend more time reading books than Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test how these beliefs and practices might shape the basic psychological processes underlying self-control, Krishna Savani at Nanyang Technological University and Veronika Job at the University of Zurich completed four studies involving hundreds of Indian participants, as well as participants in Switzerland and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual procedure was that participants completed an initial easy or difficult ten-minute challenge, such as solving mazes, the Stroop test (naming the ink colour of words denoting a different colour, e.g. “blue” written in red), word searches, or an editing type task, and then they proceeded to second, unrelated task of a similar kind. For example, the first task might be easy or difficult mazes, and the second task might be a Stroop test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian participants who completed a more difficult initial task tended to perform better on the second challenge than Indian participants who completed an easier initial challenge – in other words, reverse ego-depletion. In most cases, Western participants showed the opposite pattern of performance, showing worse results after a tougher initial test, which is the established ego-depletion effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among Indian participants, the more strongly they endorsed the idea that mental effort is energising, the stronger the reverse ego-depletion that they tended to exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new findings challenge the established theory in Western psychology that self-control or willpower is like a fuel, that if you use it up in one situation, you will have less left over for the next challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s even been suggested that self-control depends on sugar in the body and that you can enhance your willpower by consuming glucose drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as is so often the case in psychology these days, the story is not that simple. Recently, there have been several &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/06/24/new-research-challenges-the-idea-that-willpower-is-a-limited-resource/&quot;&gt;failed attempts&lt;/a&gt; to replicate the ego-depletion effect, even with Western participants. &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/11/08/labs-worldwide-report-converging-evidence-that-undermines-the-low-sugar-theory-of-depleted-willpower/&quot;&gt;Doubts&lt;/a&gt; have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/26/new-review-prompts-a-re-think-on-what-low-sugar-levels-do-to-our-thinking/&quot;&gt;raised&lt;/a&gt; about the links between self-control and glucose. Other &lt;a href=&quot;http://99u.com/articles/7257/how-to-power-through-any-demanding-task&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that if people believe their willpower is unlimited, then expending self-control doesn’t harm their performance. All this points to motivation as the key factor underlying the exercise of self-control, not some energy-based physiological process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new results are in line with the motivation account. They show for the first time that if people believe mental effort is energising, not only is their performance not adversely affected by prior mental demands, but it is actually enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How malleable are these beliefs? In a final study, Savani and Job tested the effects of manipulating Indian and American participants’ beliefs about self-control. One group read a 600-word article about how exerting willpower is energising, the other group read an article of the same length about how exerting willpower is mentally draining. Then both groups completed two tests of mental concentration in succession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants from India and America who read the energising text showed reverse ego-depletion: their performance on the second task was better if the first task was more challenging.  In fact the worse performance on the second task was for participants who read the “exerting willpower is energising” text and then completed an initial easy task. If you believe mental effort is energising, then it seems it is tasks that are too easy that take more of a toll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said their results “can be viewed as casting further doubt on claims that ego-depletion is a pan-cultural phenomenon rooted in human biology, and instead supports the argument that motivational factors play a crucial role in determining how strenuous tasks influence subsequent self-control exertion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-24735-001/&quot;&gt;Reverse Ego-Depletion: Acts of Self-Control Can Improve Subsequent Performance in Indian Cultural Contexts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors of the article and &lt;a href=&quot;https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/koula.asimakopoulou.html&quot;&gt;Koula Asimakopoulou,&lt;/a&gt; the Associate Editor who handled the peer review of the article, talk to us about their thoughts on results-free review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you think results-free review could help move towards a more robust publication process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors: &lt;/strong&gt;Results-free review is one of several measures that could improve the scientific process towards the goal of research that is more transparent, reproducible and efficient as described in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021&quot;&gt;Manifesto for Reproducible Science&lt;/a&gt;. Results-free peer review shifts the focus of the decision to publish from the results of the research towards the importance of the research question and the adequacy of the methods used to answer it. Given that the stages of the scientific process are inter-connected, introducing measures at the evaluation stage may also positively impact other stages. For example, researchers may focus more on ensuring robust designs for their studies if these are the key point of evaluation, as in results-free peer review. Further, if findings are not central to the evaluation, this may dis-incentivize researchers from data dredging (also known as p-hacking) to produce statistically significant results to increase the chances of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associate Editor: &lt;/strong&gt;It is well known that studies reporting null results are less likely to receive favorable attention in terms of publication than studies reporting significant effects. The difficulty with this approach is the resultant publication bias that can take place and which, in some cases, can mask our understanding of science, to include cases where results showing that eg. Drug therapy is no better than placebo never appear. For this reason, a results-free review is likely to help a more objective peer review process to take place.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any previous experiences of publication bias?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; We have experience of journals rejecting manuscripts describing studies that aimed to replicate and extend previously published studies because they are not seen as sufficiently novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associate Editor:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes – especially with systematic reviews where there are not enough studies showing an effect to justify their publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well aware of the bias against null results we opted for a review process we judged could guard against this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As far back as 1977, Michael J. Mahoney found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01173636&quot;&gt;reviewers judged the methods and quality of null studies more critically than those of positive studies&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, John P. A. Ioannidis identified a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/187180&quot;&gt;substantial time lag in the publication of trials reporting null results&lt;/a&gt;, with null results taking several months longer from the time of submission to eventual publication than positive results. Could results-free review offer a solution to current barriers of publishing null results?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Results-free review does indeed have the potential to overcome the publication bias against null results. This is a testable hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associate Editor:&lt;/strong&gt; Of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our experience of the review process was positive. It seemed like a more scientific approach to peer review with the paper judged on the question asked and the methods used to address the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As an author, what factors influenced your decision to opt into results-free review?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors: &lt;/strong&gt;Our study provided no evidence to support the hypotheses tested. Well aware of the bias against null results we opted for a review process we judged could guard against this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did taking part in results-free review impact the preparation or reporting of your manuscript at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors: &lt;/strong&gt;We prepared the manuscript in the same manner as for all our publications then submitted the sections sequentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your experience of having peer review conducted in this way? And how did it compare to standard peer review?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Our experience of the review process was positive. It seemed like a more scientific approach to peer review with the paper judged on the question asked and the methods used to address the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associate Editor:&lt;/strong&gt; It helped me focus on the methods of the study. The difficulty that I did have was that it felt like I was missing a big part of the paper and in many respects a paper can have a great method section but totally incomprehensible / poorly analyzed results, which worried me at first. So it felt like I was reviewing half a paper rather than a complete piece of work which will take some getting used to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/peer-review-policy&quot;&gt;open peer review&lt;/a&gt; model further improves the transparency of results-free review?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors: &lt;/strong&gt;Open peer reviews could help build confidence in the results-free process. Moreover, there is some evidence that open peer reviews are of higher quality than those prepared anonymously, although the potential risks of open-identity peer review should also be taken into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associate Editor: &lt;/strong&gt;Most certainly. I am sure we can all think of peer reviewers who have been unkind at times, probably inadvertently. I find that an open peer review system encourages reviewers to think carefully about their recommendations.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the readers’ point of view, do you think that results-free review could change the appraisal of a study’s quality?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Results-free review does indeed have the potential to alter how readers approach papers, highlighting the importance of the research question and the methods used to address this as the context in which results are to be understood. If it results in more studies being published with null findings this would provide an evidence base that is more representative of a field than the one that currently exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associate Editor:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it places greater emphasis on ensuring that when you read a Method section and an Introduction, these two tie well together and are logically related. So in that sense, yes, a results-free review may well make it harder for papers to get through a first review, unless the sections that are available to the reviewer are particularly well written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From your perspective, what are the key pros and cons of results-free review?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;There are many advantages of results-free review. As well as removing the bias towards publishing statistically significant findings, this process could improve the quality of systematic reviews if it fosters a less biased pool of published studies, and help in generating unbiased hypotheses. Overall this would improve the quality, reliability and credibility of scientific findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of cons, the division of the peer review process into two stages may require additional work for editors and reviewers, with the potential to lengthen the peer review process, although this was not our experience. Without formal evaluation, it has the potential to appear as though it is addressing important sources of bias in the evaluation of research findings but may not actually do so and thereby inadvertently lead to false reassurance about its contribution to reproducible science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associate Editor:&lt;/strong&gt; The pro is obviously a move towards minimizing publication bias. The cons have to do with the paper feeling incomplete when you first look at it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you see a future for results-free review in becoming the ‘norm’ for peer review?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, we can see this becoming the norm. However, high-impact journals must lead in adopting these procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associate Editor:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results-free review offers one potential solution to tackling publication bias. However, what other key steps do you think need to be taken to address the problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt; Other key areas to tackling publication bias are identified in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021&quot;&gt;Manifesto for Reproducible Science&lt;/a&gt;. These include: pre-registering studies, data sharing and incentivizing good practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associate Editor:&lt;/strong&gt; Dedicated outlets for studies reporting null results may be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your contribution to the future of peer review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The number of new publishing initiatives is on the rise and it is important that these are rigorously evaluated to ensure they are having the desired outcomes. The evaluation of results-free review, will be conducted by our randomized controlled trial, in order to determine how (an if) it influences publication bias and the editorial decision-making process. If deemed effective, it is our hope that results-free review will become the ‘norm’ for peer review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a field which has been plagued by the under-reporting of both &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-016-0135-2&quot;&gt;replications&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2050-7283-1-2&quot;&gt;null findings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychology&lt;/em&gt; has always had a policy of publishing all sound science, thus aiming to reduce the impact of publication bias. We have never made editorial decisions on the basis of the perceived interest of a study or its likely impact. We hope that results-free review is another feather in our bow in the effort to improve the reproducibility of our published research even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BioMed Central is committed to combating publication bias and promoting reproducibility. In a complementary approach to results-free review, BioMed Central is now also offering authors the chance to submit &lt;a href=&quot;https://cos.io/rr/&quot;&gt;Registered Reports&lt;/a&gt;, another format shifting the emphasis from research results, to the scientific questions being asked and the strength of the study design.&lt;em&gt; BMC Biology&lt;/em&gt; is the first BioMed Central journal to embrace the format and is now &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.editorialmanager.com/bmcb/default.aspx&quot;&gt;welcoming submissions&lt;/a&gt;. You can learn more about the initiative by &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-biology/2017/05/03/scientific-odyssey-pre-registering-voyage/&quot;&gt;reading this blog&lt;/a&gt; from the journal’s Chief Editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you want to help shape the future of peer review?&lt;/strong&gt; Simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.editorialmanager.com/psyo/default.aspx&quot;&gt;submit&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychology&lt;/em&gt; and click to opt-in to results-free review.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Splash-Graham-Norris-Flickr-CC-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3068-z&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; of ours published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, found that when the same portion of wine was served in a larger, rather than smaller, glass, wine sales increased by almost 10%. But how does a larger glass lead to increased sales or consumption? One possibility, suggested by another recent study, is that the same portion of wine in a larger, rather than smaller, glass is perceived as a smaller amount. This perceptual effect could lead to changes in drinking behavior – for example, larger glasses might encourage faster drinking, lessen satisfaction with the amount served, or increase the pleasure associated with drinking the wine. We wanted to examine these possible mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cochrane.org/CD011045/PUBHLTH_portion-package-or-tableware-size-changing-selection-and-consumption-food-alcohol-and-tobacco&quot;&gt;Our recent Cochrane review&lt;/a&gt; found that larger portion sizes and tableware increased consumption of food and non-alcoholic drinks, but found no evidence relating to consumption of alcohol. If larger glasses increase alcohol sales as suggested by &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3068-z&quot;&gt;our recent study&lt;/a&gt; increasingly large glasses could counteract policies and regulations aimed at curbing alcohol consumption. Given that alcohol is associated with an increased risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cancer and liver disease, reducing the amount consumed would lead to significant health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9120&quot; style=&quot;width: 298px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-9120&quot; height=&quot;268&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Fig-1-300x279.jpg&quot; width=&quot;288&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;The glasses used in the study&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-017-0183-2&quot;&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we randomized female university students to drink a fixed portion of red wine (175 ml) in a larger (370 ml) or smaller (250 ml) wine glasses of the same design, in a lab-based setting. We observed their micro-drinking behavior (drinking speed, number and duration of sips) using video recordings and assessed their satisfaction and pleasure with the wine they were served using self-report measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found no evidence that consuming wine from a larger, in comparison to a smaller glass, alters micro-drinking behavior, satisfaction or pleasure. Nonetheless, the results showed that regardless of glass size, faster drinking and greater pleasure increased the desire to drink further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed to determine whether a larger glass increases consumption by encouraging faster drinking and increasing pleasure in naturalistic settings such as bars or pubs, and with a more representative sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If clear mechanisms for how larger wine glasses may increase alcohol consumption are established, this would clarify the circumstances under which glass size may have an effect. This might inform local policies, for example, larger glass sizes served in licensed premises could be capped in order to limit alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 Complete and accurate reference genomes and annotations provide fundamental tools for characterization of genetic and functional variation. These resources facilitate the determination of biological processes and support translation of research findings into improved and sustainable agricultural technologies. Many reference genomes for crop plants have been generated over the past decade, but these genomes are often fragmented and missing complex repeat regions. Here we report the assembly and annotation of a reference genome of maize, a genetic and agricultural model species, using single-molecule real-time sequencing and high-resolution optical mapping. Relative to the previous reference genome, our assembly features a 52-fold increase in contig length and notable improvements in the assembly of intergenic spaces and centromeres. Characterization of the repetitive portion of the genome revealed more than 130,000 intact transposable elements, allowing us to identify transposable element lineage expansions that are unique to maize. Gene annotations were updated using 111,000 full-length transcripts obtained by single-molecule real-time sequencing. In addition, comparative optical mapping of two other inbred maize lines revealed a prevalence of deletions in regions of low gene density and maize lineage-specific genes.

You get on during a shift change, when a new driver takes over for the old one. The new driver appears to be Middle Eastern, and for a second you have a fleeting reaction that the situation might become dangerous. This is embarrassing and ridiculous, you think. You hate that the thought even crossed your mind. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_by_country&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1.8 billion&lt;/a&gt; Muslims in the world. How many are radical Islamist extremists? For example, in the UK at present, the number comprises maybe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/follow-up-on-london-bridge-attack/2017/06/04/5216bbb2-48c5-11e7-8de1-cec59a9bf4b1_story.html&quot; title=&quot;3,000&quot;&gt;0.00000167&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cwcot&quot; id=&quot;cwos&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://0.0.237.182/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;%&lt;/a&gt; of all Muslims? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Language matters.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/TheresaMayOfficial/posts/1757704577579641&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Theresa May&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“First, while the recent attacks are not connected by common  networks, they are connected in one important sense. They are bound  together by &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;the single, evil ideology of Islamist extremism that  preaches hatred, sows division, and promotes sectarianism. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is  an ideology that claims our Western values of freedom, democracy and  human rights are incompatible with the religion of Islam. It is an  ideology that is a perversion of Islam and a perversion of the truth.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/21/politics/trump-saudi-speech-transcript/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;from his speech in Saudi Arabia&quot;&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;“That means honestly confronting the crisis of Islamist extremism and the  Islamist terror groups it inspires.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And it means standing together  against the murder of innocent Muslims, the oppression of women, the  persecution of Jews, and the slaughter of Christians.&lt;br /&gt;. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DRIVE THEM OUT OF THIS EARTH.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In both of these cases, the world leaders did acknowledge that &lt;i&gt;Islamist extremism&lt;/i&gt; is not the same as the religion of Islam. Nonetheless, in terms of statistical co-occurrence in the English language, the root word &lt;i&gt;Islam-&lt;/i&gt; is now associated with all that is bad and evil in the world. Could the constant exposure to news about radical Islamist terrorism and Trump's proposed &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/871143765473406976&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Muslim Ban&lt;/a&gt; result in an involuntary or “forced” stereotyping in the bus scenario above?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recent study found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/183&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases&lt;/a&gt;, which means that &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;machines&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (which do not have cultural stereotypes) become “biased” when they learn word association patterns from large bodies of text, such as Google News. The authors used a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;a representation of words as points in a vector space&quot;&gt;word embedding&lt;/a&gt; algorithm called Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) to improve the performance of the machine learning model. As a measure of human bias, they used the popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9654756.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;implicit association test&lt;/a&gt; (IAT), from which they developed the Word-Embedding Association Test (WEAT). Instead of response times (RTs) to a specific set of words, WEAT used the distance between a set of vectors in semantic space. The authors were able to replicate the associations seen in every IAT they tested (&lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/183&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Caliskan et al., 2017)&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The  number, variety, and substantive importance of our results raise the  possibility that all implicit human biases are reflected in the  statistical properties of language. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Arab-Muslim Implicit Association Test&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the relationship between word associations and implicit bias, I decided to take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/Study?tid=-1&quot;&gt;Arab-Muslim IAT&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.projectimplicit.net/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Project Implicit&lt;/a&gt;, an organization interested in “&lt;b&gt;implicit social cognition &lt;/b&gt;— thoughts and feelings outside of conscious awareness and control.” This definition seemed to fit with the bus scenario, which involved an impulse to profile the driver based on a rapid evaluation of perceived ethnicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Arab-Muslim IAT, the participant classifies words as good (e.g, &lt;i&gt;Fantastic&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fabulous&lt;/i&gt;) or bad (e.g, &lt;i&gt;Horrible&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Hurtful&lt;/i&gt;), and proper names as Arab Muslim (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Akbar&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Hakim&lt;/i&gt;) or “Other People”  (e.g, &lt;i&gt;Ernesto&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Philippe&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Kazuki&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The bias is revealed when you have to sort both of these categories at the same time. Are you slower when Good/Arab Muslim are mapped to the same key, compared to when Bad/Arab Muslim are mapped to the same key? (and vice versa).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results are below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;- click on image for a larger view -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0J2VZ365avA/WTkfvaaoGMI/AAAAAAAAMLQ/0vcxQugKTHoD1ThneoLenXVlcWybyWgzgCEw/s1600/Debriefing_2%2BArab%2BMuslim%2BIAT.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;360&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1011&quot; height=&quot;141&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0J2VZ365avA/WTkfvaaoGMI/AAAAAAAAMLQ/0vcxQugKTHoD1ThneoLenXVlcWybyWgzgCEw/s400/Debriefing_2%2BArab%2BMuslim%2BIAT.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I showed a &lt;b&gt;moderate automatic preference for Arab Muslims over Other People&lt;/b&gt;. But this wasn't completely unique compared to the population of 327,000 other participants who have taken this test:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;The summary of other people's results shows that &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;most  people have  little to no implicit preference for Arab Muslims compared  to Other  People&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; - i.e.,  they are just as fast when sorting good words  and Arab Muslims than  sorting good words and Other People.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ks6rWHWMjiU/WTVCeYyKCXI/AAAAAAAAMKs/PDAt7qbXomEoALhwdfqaqs5V2dKPEeKHwCLcB/s1600/percent%2Bof%2Bweb%2Brespondents%2Bwith%2Beach%2Bscore.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;269&quot; data-original-width=&quot;523&quot; height=&quot;205&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ks6rWHWMjiU/WTVCeYyKCXI/AAAAAAAAMKs/PDAt7qbXomEoALhwdfqaqs5V2dKPEeKHwCLcB/s400/percent%2Bof%2Bweb%2Brespondents%2Bwith%2Beach%2Bscore.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aggregate results above covered a period of 11.5 years ending in December 2015. The strength of semantic associations between words can vary over time and contexts, so we can wonder if this has shifted any in the last year. In addition, different results have been observed when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/23175679/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;faces were used&lt;/a&gt; instead of names, and when a better list of “Other People” names was used to specify ingroup vs. outgroup (see explanation in footnote &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;#2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Muslim-Terrorism test has in fact been developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22435844&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Webb et al. (2011)&lt;/a&gt;. They used a variant of the IAT (the &lt;a href=&quot;http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/gnat/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GNAT&lt;/a&gt;) with Muslim names (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Abdul&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ali&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Farid&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Khalid&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tariq&lt;/i&gt;), Scottish names (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Alistair&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Angus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Douglas&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gordon&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Hamish&lt;/i&gt;), terrorism-related words (e.g., &lt;i&gt;attack&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bomb&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;blast&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;explosives&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;threat&lt;/i&gt;) and peace-related words (e.g., &lt;i&gt;friendship&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;harmony&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;serenity&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;unity&lt;/i&gt;). In an interesting twist, the authors varied “implementation intentions” to flip the Muslim-Terrorism test to the Muslim-Peace test in half of the subjects:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Following the practice trials, one-half of the participants (&lt;i&gt;implementation intention condition&lt;/i&gt;)  were asked to form an implementation intention to help them to respond  especially quickly to Muslim names and peace-related words. Participants  were asked to tell themselves ‘If Muslim names and peace are at the top  of the screen, then I respond especially fast to Muslim words and peace  words!’. Participants were asked to repeat this statement several times  before continuing with the experiment. The other half of the  participants (&lt;i&gt;standard instruction condition&lt;/i&gt;) were given no further instructions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually discovered this strategy on my own in 2008, when my IAT results revealed I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2008/01/human-all-too-human-and-alien.html&quot; title=&quot;Human, All Too Human (AND Alien)&quot;&gt;Human AND Alien&lt;/a&gt; and NEITHER &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2008/01/im-alive-im-dead.html&quot; title=&quot;I'm Alive I'm Dead&quot;&gt;Dead NOR Alive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And indeed, the Muslim-Peace instructions neutralized the strong Muslim-Terrorism association seen in the control participants &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22435844&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Webb et al. (2011)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cG_g_4BlKlY/WTkLkWIrVFI/AAAAAAAAMK8/a8iZZ90PMzEg0kq8SH-4bnep--I_fqVjACLcB/s1600/Muslim-Peace%2BGNAT.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;326&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1167&quot; height=&quot;111&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cG_g_4BlKlY/WTkLkWIrVFI/AAAAAAAAMK8/a8iZZ90PMzEg0kq8SH-4bnep--I_fqVjACLcB/s400/Muslim-Peace%2BGNAT.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calvin Lai and colleagues conducted a high-powered series of experiments showing that instructions such as implementation intentions and faking the IAT can shift implicit racial biases (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661055&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lai et al., 2014&lt;/a&gt;), but these interventions are short-lived (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27454041&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lai et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote about the former study in 2014: &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.ca/2014/03/contest-to-reduce-implicit-racial-bias.html&quot;&gt;Contest to Reduce Implicit Racial Bias Shows Empathy and Perspective-Taking Don't Work&lt;/a&gt;.

Bryson&lt;/a&gt;, a co-author on the machine learning/semantic bias paper, wrote a very informative blog post about this work: &lt;a href=&quot;https://joanna-bryson.blogspot.com/2017/04/we-didnt-prove-prejudice-is-true-role.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;We Didn't Prove Prejudice Is True (A Role for Consciousness)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I cannot imagine what it's like to be a survivor of the recent  Manchester and London attacks, and my deepest condolences go out  to the  families who have lost loved ones&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Notice I put “Other People” in quotes. That's because the names are not all from the same category (country/ethnicity) &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; Latino, French, and Japanese in the examples above. This lack of uniformity could slow down RTs for the “Other People” category. A better alternate category would have been all French names, for instance.

 Even before we're born, human beings are sensitive to face-like shapes, according to a paper just published in Current Biology.



British researchers Vincent M. Reid and colleagues of the University of Lancaster used lasers to project a pattern of three red dots onto the abdomen of pregnant women. The lasers were bright enough to be visible from inside the womb. The dots were arranged to be either &quot;face-like&quot;, i.e. with two &quot;eyes&quot; above one &quot;mouth&quot;, or inverted.

 Have you heard of the idea that smiling actually makes you joyful? Perhaps you know of the experiment where researchers got people to hold a pen in their mouth, so they had to smile, and it made them find cartoons funnier.



If you're familiar with this idea, then you're familar with the work of German psychologist Fritz Strack, who carried out the famous pen-based grinning study, back in 1988.

 &lt;p&gt;New “CRO Finder” Connects Scientists with Specialized Resources&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Cliff Culver, VP Strategy and GM, Science Exchange | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scienceexchange.com&quot;&gt;www.scienceexchange.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 7, 2017 — The Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), the only public charity solely focused on funding the development of drugs for Alzheimer’s, and Science Exchange today announced the launch of ADDF ACCESS, a first-of-its-kind online platform designed to match scientists working on central nervous system (CNS) diseases with a vetted network of contract research organizations (CROs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADDF ACCESS meets the unique needs of scientists in both academia and small biotech companies by combining the resources of Science Exchange, the world’s leading marketplace for outsourced research and development, with the Alzheimer’s drug discovery knowledge of the ADDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drug discovery requires a wide range of expertise, from medicinal chemistry and pharmacology to project management and regulatory affairs,” said Lauren Friedman, Ph.D., ADDF ACCESS program director. “Researchers don’t always have the interdisciplinary teams needed to develop a drug. We created the new ACCESS website with Science Exchange to connect researchers with high-quality CROs and provide guidance and resources to help successfully advance their drug programs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On ADDF ACCESS, scientists will find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A network of CROs and consultants with CNS drug discovery expertise, vetted by the ADDF and Science Exchange&lt;br /&gt;
An expert concierge service to match scientists with the right CROs, solicit multiple competitive quotes, and manage projects&lt;br /&gt;
A library of educational resources, including a guide to CNS drug discovery and development&lt;br /&gt;
“Early-stage drug research is the engine that drives progress in treating Alzheimer’s and CNS diseases,” said Dr. Howard Fillit, M.D., executive director and chief science officer of the ADDF. “We are excited to provide a resource specifically designed to facilitate connections that fuel this engine. Every scientific discovery gets us closer to finding a treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eliminating the laborious, resource-intensive process of finding and negotiating with CROs and other service providers helps researchers focus on their important work, and that’s what Science Exchange is all about,” said Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of Science Exchange. “We are thrilled to partner with the ADDF on this new ACCESS website that will give scientists specializing in CNS diseases the tools and services they need to bring important, potentially life-saving drugs to market faster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more, visit https://www.alzdiscovery.org/addf-access&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF)&lt;br /&gt;
Founded in 1998 by Leonard A. and Ronald S. Lauder, the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) is dedicated to rapidly accelerating the discovery of drugs to prevent, treat and cure Alzheimer’s disease. The ADDF is the only public charity solely focused on funding the development of drugs for Alzheimer’s, employing a venture philanthropy model to support research in academia and the biotech industry. Through the generosity of its donors, the ADDF has awarded over $100 million to fund more than 500 Alzheimer’s drug discovery programs and clinical trials in 18 countries. To learn more, please visit: http://www.alzdiscovery.org/.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technique was first investigated in the nineties by a trio of researchers – &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1994.tb00610.x/abstract&quot;&gt;Michael Santos, Craig Leve and Anthony Pratkanis&lt;/a&gt; – with experimental assistants posing as panhandlers on Santa Cruz wharf and asking passers-by for either 17 cents or a quarter. They found the unusual sum led to more compliance from the passers-by, and so to more coinage in the cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers hypothesised that the unusual sum is effective as it disrupts the “refusal script” that people have primed in response to generic requests, and instead generates curiosity that encourages the person to engage. The paper spawned further work exploring the technique, including its effectiveness when asking for someone’s time, but some studies found no effects or even negative effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sense of this muddied picture, Seyoung Lee and Thomas Feeley from the University of Buffalo looked across the available research, six studies in all, to verify whether there is a reliable case for the technique and what might be driving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does piquing pay? Across the studies, there were 16 tests of whether successful requests led to more generous donations when the request was for an unusual sum, and the meta-analysis showed that this was not the case: donations, when given, were similar for both typical and unusual request amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, piquers earned more overall, because the technique enhanced the chances of getting a donation in the first place. The size of the effect was larger than for other tricks for gaining compliance like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-in-the-door_technique&quot;&gt;foot in door&lt;/a&gt; technique (.27 vs. .11 in terms of statistical effect sizes). The effect size varied across different studies and conditions, so Lee and Feeley investigated what might moderate it, finding the technique more successful in studies conducted in France compared to the US, and working better for smaller requests than for those involving more than a dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis also showed that when the technique was used, people were more likely to respond by asking what the money was for. This is consistent with the idea that the technique disrupts automatic processes and encourages conscious engagement with the request. It’s as if the unusual detail shakes the person out of a slumber to see the moment as the beginning of an interaction, rather than as environmental noise to tune out. Unfortunately the paper doesn’t provide data on whether these curious people were more likely to donate; we do know, however, that when the piquer preemptively explained what the request was for (as per my opening example), participants were more likely to comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many persuasion techniques are overtly exploitative, trying to win compliance by wearing away the target’s defences. Piquing in some way fits this mould, by dodging underneath the normal means of parrying an unsolicited request. But its basic mechanism seems legitimate: to wake us up to what’s happening right now, and then leave it to our conscience how to react. After all, even if you have a principled objection to giving to charity street reps or to the homeless, it’s no bad thing to sometimes be prompted to consciously reflect on your decision.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;New “CRO Finder” Connects Scientists with Specialized Resources&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Cliff Culver, VP Strategy and GM, Science Exchange | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scienceexchange.com&quot;&gt;www.scienceexchange.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;xn-location&quot;&gt;NEW YORK&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;xn-chron&quot;&gt;June 7, 2017&lt;/span&gt;  — The Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), the only public charity solely focused on funding the development of drugs for Alzheimer’s, and Science Exchange today announced the launch of ADDF ACCESS, a first-of-its-kind online platform designed to match scientists working on central nervous system (CNS) diseases with a vetted network of contract research organizations (CROs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADDF ACCESS meets the unique needs of scientists in both academia and small biotech companies by combining the resources of Science Exchange, the world’s leading marketplace for outsourced research and development, with the Alzheimer’s drug discovery knowledge of the ADDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drug discovery requires a wide range of expertise, from medicinal chemistry and pharmacology to project management and regulatory affairs,” said &lt;span class=&quot;xn-person&quot;&gt;Lauren Friedman&lt;/span&gt;, Ph.D., ADDF ACCESS program director. “Researchers don’t always have the interdisciplinary teams needed to develop a drug. We created the new ACCESS website with Science Exchange to connect researchers with high-quality CROs and provide guidance and resources to help successfully advance their drug programs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On ADDF ACCESS, scientists will find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A network of CROs and consultants with CNS drug discovery expertise, vetted by the ADDF and Science Exchange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An expert concierge service to match scientists with the right CROs, solicit multiple competitive quotes, and manage projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A library of educational resources, including a guide to CNS drug discovery and development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Early-stage drug research is the engine that drives progress in treating Alzheimer’s and CNS diseases,” said Dr. &lt;span class=&quot;xn-person&quot;&gt;Howard Fillit&lt;/span&gt;, M.D., executive director and chief science officer of the ADDF. “We are excited to provide a resource specifically designed to facilitate connections that fuel this engine. Every scientific discovery gets us closer to finding a treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eliminating the laborious, resource-intensive process of finding and negotiating with CROs and other service providers helps researchers focus on their important work, and that’s what Science Exchange is all about,” said &lt;span class=&quot;xn-person&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Iorns&lt;/span&gt;, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of Science Exchange. “We are thrilled to partner with the ADDF on this new ACCESS website that will give scientists specializing in CNS diseases the tools and services they need to bring important, potentially life-saving drugs to market faster.”&lt;/p&gt;

 Batman sucks compared to the rest of the Justice League: Superman could vaporize him before he could even think to pull out his anti-Superman spray; the Flash could pummel him at light speed; Wonder Woman could Lasso of Truth him. But Batman's gone toe-to-toe with each of them and won many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kFyRPqh1WNo/UksI1q1HmuI/AAAAAAAAFmI/wpfeTeaBohQ/s400/batman_tower_of_babel.jpg&quot; style=&quot;cursor: move;&quot; width=&quot;381&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;(Seriously if you haven't read &lt;i&gt;Tower of Babel&lt;/i&gt;, stop reading my drivel right now and go do so.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the fact that it's all made up, how can this happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batman's strength is in his planning. He thinks ahead and prepares for every contingency, no matter how small. There's a very important lesson here. It's okay if you're not the smartest, fastest, or strongest as long as you're mindful of your limitations and can admit your own weaknesses. To own them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I give academic talks, I've got 20-30 extra slides tacked onto the end that contain data and results from several side experiments. Not only is it thorough, but it shows you've thought hard about the problems you're addressing. It's amazing the kinds of reactions you get from the crowd when someone asks a pointed scientific question and you can say, &quot;well according to this followup experiment we found that...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's no secret that I was a really poor undergraduate student. I only vaguely knew what I wanted to do and I couldn't admit that I didn't love where I was at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hated busy work. I hated the social pressure to be &lt;i&gt;seen&lt;/i&gt; doing something as opposed to &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; doing something. That's what I felt like college was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I graduated my two roommates and I spent most of that first post-college summer locked away in a bedroom playing video games until sunrise. All day, every day. We moved all of our desks into one bedroom so we could sit side-by-side-by-side and play &lt;i&gt;Counterstrike &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Team Fortress&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Civ III&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Starcraft&lt;/i&gt;, and whatever else grabbed our attention. This gaming marathon was punctuated by me heading out to party on the weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend of 4 months at the time (and now, by some stroke of luck I'll never fathom, my wife) would stop by the apartment on her way to work in the morning to say hello. We'd all still be sleeping, of course, because we'd just gone to bed after another marathon night of gaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the outside this must have looked like incredible laziness. But it was largely apathy and paralysis induced by the unknown. I just didn't know how to get a job, how to be a scientist, or how to change my situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since those days I've caught a lot of lucky breaks to help me get to where I am today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a big part of what helped my early scientific career was my laziness. Or rather, my disdain of busy work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm a fan of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Enough_for_Love#The_Tale_of_the_Man_Who_Was_Too_Lazy_to_Fail&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;constructive laziness&quot; and being too lazy to fail&lt;/a&gt;. That is, I try to take the time to think though the entirety of a problem before trying to attack it. This can take you a long way (though it can also hinder you if you're not careful...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/974/&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; src=&quot;http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_general_problem.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Algorithms are laziness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laziness is undervalued and &quot;putting in your hours&quot; is overvalued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait, that's not quite right... maybe a better way for me to say that is: the power of constructive, focused laziness is undervalued and people put an unwarranted emphasis on &quot;being seen at work&quot;. Think back to the story about Gauss's algorithm for summing the first 100 digits. It was busy work and he solved it by being smart (and possibly a smart ass), not by just chugging through it like everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recognize that what I'm about to say comes from the perspective of a certain kind of privilege, but I've worked manual labor jobs and there is something to be said for a career that you can leave at work. Science isn't like that. There's a cost associated with it. When I was driving a forklift and working the loading dock, I sure as hell didn't lay in bed at night wondering how to do it better. But now I spend a lot of my time &quot;on&quot; and thinking about my research. I have to make time to turn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that's a cost I accept because working the loading dock wasn't what I wanted to be doing forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without my deep, internal drive to want to socialize, hang out, shoot the shit, and do nothing, I wouldn't be where I am today. I value spending time with my wife, son, and friends, and I value a career that allows me to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Being privileged to work hard for long hours at something you think is worth doing is the best kind of play.&quot; - Robert Heinlein, Lazarus Long, &lt;i&gt;Time Enough for Love&lt;/i&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.scienceexchange.com/feed/#kaitlin&quot;&gt;Kaitlin Ziemer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.scienceexchange.com/feed/#JR&quot;&gt;JR Clark&lt;/a&gt;, Science Exchange | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scienceexchange.com&quot;&gt;www.scienceexchange.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Today, we celebrate World Oceans Day with a Science Exchange success story. This is a story about connecting ocean conservation advocates with the scientists whose expertise is helping to guide conservation strategy.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_1080&quot; style=&quot;width: 391px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;World Oceans Day -- Sharks&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-1080&quot; height=&quot;259&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/World-Oceans-Day-leopard-sharks-300x204.jpg&quot; width=&quot;381&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Robust shark populations are a sign of healthy oceans. [photo credit: JR Clark]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fusion.net/section/project-earth/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Project Earth team from Fusion TV &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;approached Science Exchange with a unique sequencing project. They were working on a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fusion.net/story/569662/fusion-shark-cartilage-industry/#&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;documentary film &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;about the illegal poaching of sharks for use in shark cartilage capsules.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Studies have shown that shark cartilage is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2902826/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;ineffective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; or even &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576906003651&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;pro-inflammatory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. Despite this and the importance of conserving sharks, who are the ocean’s apex predators, the cartilage capsule industry has managed to persuade retailers and consumers that shark cartilage could promote joint and bone health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Fusion TV Project Earth team wanted to find out if cartilage pills contained illegally obtained shark tissue. They needed a service provider who could perform DNA sequencing on 30 different supplements to see if they contained protected or endangered sharks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Through the Science Exchange network, the Fusion TV Project Earth team obtained sequencing services from a California-based service provider. Together, they were able to detect DNA from the endangered scalloped hammerhead sharks, whose trade is highly regulated, in the capsules sold at nationwide health food stores and pharmacies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Fusion TV Project Earth team urged both the cartilage pill manufacturers and retailers to share more precise information about the origins of the shark material found in the pills. In response, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fusion.net/story/569662/fusion-shark-cartilage-industry/#&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;two major retailers removed shark cartilage pills from their stores and website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;These results showed that scientific evidence can influence positive change and help to protect our natural environment. And by providing the Fusion TV Project Earth team with easy access to the world’s best scientific service providers, Science Exchange helped put the data directly into the hands of the agents of change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/suzukii-strawberry-by-David-Duneau-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impressive diversity of animals we see today results from evolutionary adaptations that allow animals to inhabit different types of habitats and exploit different food sources. The ability to adapt to a new food has ecological, evolutionary, and agricultural relevance: many of the world’s most problematic pest species cause extensive agricultural damage precisely because of their ability to exploit new foods. This makes understanding how animals adapt their biology to match that of their food all the more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to use a new food, animals need to tune their physiology, their morphology, and their behaviour to match the characteristics of the new food. They need to adjust their physiology so that the nutritional composition of the new food can support their growth and reproduction. They need to develop morphological features that allow them to exploit the new food. Finally, they need to acquire behavioural preferences to find and to choose to feed on the new food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to understand how animals adapt to new foods is to compare two closely related species that differ in their food use. This is especially powerful if we know that one of the two species has evolved to use a new food from within a group of species that share a common food source. Our study uses this approach to compare two species of fruit flies: &lt;em&gt;Drosophila suzukii&lt;/em&gt; – a pest species that has evolved to feed on ripe fruit – and &lt;em&gt;Drosophila biarmipes&lt;/em&gt; – a close relative that, like the other species in this group, feeds on rotting fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9112&quot; style=&quot;width: 2724px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9112&quot; height=&quot;1939&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Biarmipes-mf-strawberry-by-David-Duneau.jpg&quot; width=&quot;2714&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drosophila biarmipes&lt;/em&gt; feeding on a strawberry.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;David Duneau&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drosophila suzukii, &lt;/em&gt;commonly known as the spotted wing &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;, has recently invaded both the United States and Europe. Its spread has devastated crops of soft skinned fruit, including cherries, strawberries and grapes, on both continents. This fly causes such damage by laying its eggs under the skin of these fruits, thanks to a serrated, enlarged ovipositor – the structure female flies use to insert their eggs into food. The larvae then grow inside the ripening fruit, eating the fruit and rendering it unsuitable for human consumption. Its sister species, &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;biarmipes&lt;/em&gt;, has a more modest ovipositor that cannot penetrate the skin of the fruit. This more modest ovipositor of &lt;em&gt;Drosophila biarmipes&lt;/em&gt; is similar to many other &lt;em&gt;Drosophila &lt;/em&gt;species, and is thought to restrict most &lt;em&gt;Drosophila &lt;/em&gt;flies to a diet of rotting fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Drosophila suzukii’s&lt;/em&gt; enlarged ovipositor has received considerable attention, this species would not be able to cause such extensive damage if the larvae were unable to use the ripe fruit to support their development. &lt;em&gt;Drosophila &lt;/em&gt;larvae, in general, are mostly interested in eating the yeasts that grow on the fruit, as this is their main source of protein. Relative to rotting fruit, ripe fruit has significantly less yeast. Thus, the switch from rotting to ripe fruit represents a considerable nutritional challenge for larvae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this, our study explored the differences in the nutritional requirements between the larvae of both species. We found that &lt;em&gt;Drosophila suzukii&lt;/em&gt; larvae required less protein for their growth and survival than did their close relative, &lt;em&gt;Drosophila biarmipes&lt;/em&gt;. This was reflected in their feeding patterns; &lt;em&gt;Drosophila biarmipes &lt;/em&gt;larvae consumed more protein than &lt;em&gt;Drosophila suzukii. &lt;/em&gt;Furthermore, when offered a choice between protein rich and protein poor diets, &lt;em&gt;Drosophila biarmipes&lt;/em&gt; larvae showed a stronger preference for protein rich food than &lt;em&gt;Drosophila suzukii&lt;/em&gt; larvae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The above video, taken by Cláudia Mendes, shows a Drosophila suzukii larvae being found inside a ripe cherry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We next explored whether the adult females differed in their choice of where to lay their eggs. Unlike the larvae, adult females of the two species did not differ in their preference for egg laying. Rather, we found that females differed in their preference for the hardness of the egg laying substrate. While &lt;em&gt;Drosophila biarmipes &lt;/em&gt;females laid eggs only in the softest food, &lt;em&gt;Drosophila suzukii&lt;/em&gt; females showed no preference for substrate hardness. This demonstrates that while larvae use nutritional cues to determine their preferences of what to eat, adult females use cues related to the physical properties of the food to determine where to lay their eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study illustrates how a simple shift in food use, from rotting to ripe fruit, involves adaptations of several traits across both larval and adult life stages. Importantly, they highlight how studying a single adaptation will provide a limited picture of how animals come to exploit new foods. Rather, studying the suite of traits involved in adapting to new foods will provide greater insights into how animals evolve new food preferences and how these traits potentiate the emergence of new pests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we sometimes stay friends with ex-partners? There may be many reasons, but according to a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886916302690&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Personality and Individual Differences &lt;/i&gt;they fall into seven main categories – and men and women don’t quite see eye-to-eye on them. The research also found that certain personality traits were related to motivations for staying friends after a break-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24810&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Mogilski and Lisa Welling at Oakland University, US, asked a group of 348 volunteers to think of as many reasons as possible for why two former partners might want to remain friends. This resulted in a 153-item list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second group of hundreds more people – all of whom who had gone through at least one break-up (and were overwhelmingly exclusively heterosexual) – rated the importance of each item on a scale of 1 – 5. Then they completed personality questionnaires, including one tapping features of pathological personality, such as the tendency to experience negative emotions, antagonism (aggression and grandiosity), and sensation-seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the ratings, Mogilski and Welling identified seven main categories of reason for wanting to stay friends with an ex:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliability/sentimentality (e.g. “They made me a better person.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pragmatism (e.g. “They had a lot of money.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continued romantic attraction (e.g. “I still had feelings for them.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children and shared resources (e.g. “Me or my ex was pregnant.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diminished romantic attraction – which could cause a friendly relationship to lose its sexual aspect (e.g. “I lost sexual interest.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social relationship maintenance (e.g. “To prevent awkwardness in our friend group.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sexual access (e.g. “To keep having sex with them.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, participants rated the reliability/sentimentality reasons as most important and practical reasons as least important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some gender differences: men gave higher scores to practical and sexual access reasons than women did. Still, when certain aspects of personality (extraversion, honesty/humility and antagonism) were controlled for, the gender difference was only slight – in other words, men and women with similar personalities tended to give similar reasons. In particular, participants of both sexes who scored more highly on the trait of antagonism and/or on extraversion, gave higher ratings to practical reasons for maintaining a friendship. Extraversion in men and women was also associated with being motivated to maintain a friendship to continue sexual encounters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another link with personality was that people who experienced more negative emotions put a higher importance on reliability/sentimentality reasons, and continued romantic attraction. This could be because they suffer greater psychological distress during a break-up, and staying friends with an ex who can offer continued support and romantic interest may mitigate this, the researchers suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407500173007&quot;&gt;Other work&lt;/a&gt; has found that friendships with former partners are common, and about half of divorced people report &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0192513X05275435&quot;&gt;continued contact&lt;/a&gt; two and ten years after separating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings suggest that friendships after break-ups may provide an opportunity for ex-partners to continue to exchange desirable resources – such as love, status, information and money, Mogilski and Welling write in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few limitations with the study, however. The mean age of the participants was 21.4 years in the first group and 21 in the second. Arguably, university students have only limited experience on which to base many of their judgements, and relatively few will have personal experience of reasons relating to pregnancy and children. Rather than seeking participants’ general attitudes to this issue, future work could also benefit from asking people about the motives behind specific post-relationship friendships they’ve experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

 When I sent off the draft of my first paper to my PhD advisor I really felt like all the hard work was finished. I'd spent years getting my project started: getting IRB approval, identifying subjects, collecting data, and so on. Then I spent many more months analyzing the data, pouring over every detail. Then I spent many more months putting together figures and writing the draft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all of that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's only the tip of the iceberg. Let's get into my personal statistics (since those are the data from which I have to draw) to show you the language of peer review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past few years I've been co-author on 15 research manuscripts, of which I have been the main author on 7. I currently have 3 more that have undergone at least one round of peer review. These 10 first-author manuscripts have &lt;i&gt;collectively&lt;/i&gt; undergone about 20 rounds of review, each consisting of 2-4 reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than 16,000 words have been written by reviewers about these 10 papers. In response to &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;, I have written over 14,000 more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of note, the total word length for all 10 of these papers comes in at around 40,000 or so (not including references). This means that, for every paper I write, I will probably have to write around 35% &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; than what I consider to be the &quot;final&quot; version in order to justify its publication to reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep that in mind next time you try to estimate how much longer it will take for you to publish your manuscript. I often forget this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on the flip side, I've performed approximately 25 reviews for some of the most prestigious journals in cognitive neuroscience including: &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PNAS&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Neuron&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Neurology&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cerebral Cortex&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For these 25 reviews I have written over 14,000 words. That may seem light at only ~560 words per review but my personal reviewing philosophy is to be concise but thorough. It is much easier to critique than to create!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have not experienced it, peer review is a strange affair. It's sort of like a masquerade ball in that peoples' identities are unknown (at least in one direction), but you know that you'll probably have to see these people unmasked at some point so you better give the appearance of propriety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a lot of weird and interesting language play and kowtowing, with phrases such as &quot;we thank the reviewers for their insightful comments&quot; and &quot;this is a very interesting manuscript, but...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The word of the day is &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/asteism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;asteism&lt;/a&gt;&quot;: &quot;Polite irony; a genteel and ingenious manner of deriding another.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This generally sums up the peer-review process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just out of curiosity I decided to run all my reviews, comments received by reviewers, and response to reviewers through a tag cloud generator (thank you &lt;a href=&quot;http://tagcrowd.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tagcrowd&lt;/a&gt;) just to see what it looked like. Check it out, I believe this to be a decent, quick insight into the language of peer-review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;My Reviews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pZ3as2idf3M/T1VfSmCsKbI/AAAAAAAAECE/rJ6RcTSJI-g/s1600/bradley_voytek-reviews.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pZ3as2idf3M/T1VfSmCsKbI/AAAAAAAAECE/rJ6RcTSJI-g/s400/bradley_voytek-reviews.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You'll notice right away that certain keywords appear that represent the general class of manuscripts I'm asked to review: &quot;EEG&quot;, &quot;coupling&quot;, &quot;gamma&quot;, &quot;patients&quot;, and so on. The appearance of words such as &quot;addressed&quot;, &quot;important&quot;, and &quot;interesting&quot; belie the kinds of language I use (I generally &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; find most papers I review to be genuinely interesting, by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments Received by Reviewers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iDB1MAllh5I/T1WIZJTpHCI/AAAAAAAAECM/IBFCNxc-wH4/s1600/bradley_voytek-reviewer_comments.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;140&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iDB1MAllh5I/T1WIZJTpHCI/AAAAAAAAECM/IBFCNxc-wH4/s400/bradley_voytek-reviewer_comments.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here again you see &quot;interesting&quot; appear. Everyone is interesting! We're all special snowflakes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good exercise for me though because I can see that reviewers have a tendency to use words like &quot;specific&quot; and &quot;literature&quot; against me. When I write I have a tendency to &quot;jump ahead&quot; and just assume that people will follow my logic without &quot;showing my work&quot;. This is sloppy on my part and I struggle with the need to explicitly connect my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has to remind me of this fact for every. Single. Paper. That I write. For every talk I give. You'd think I'd have learned my lesson by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Response to Reviewers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vly8NYaRXnk/T1WIf_pl-pI/AAAAAAAAECU/GGpmC-k6NHg/s1600/bradley_voytek-response_to_reviewers.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;172&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vly8NYaRXnk/T1WIf_pl-pI/AAAAAAAAECU/GGpmC-k6NHg/s400/bradley_voytek-response_to_reviewers.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great. You see how &quot;reviewer&quot;, &quot;correct&quot;, &quot;thank&quot;, and &quot;suggested&quot; show up a lot in my response to reviewers? This is another interesting aspect of peer review. This shows the deferential language that scientists use in responding to their peers. This represents all the times I've said, &quot;the reviewer is correct&quot; and &quot;we thank the reviewers for their suggestions&quot; and the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this was my attempt to peel back the curtain on peer review a bit if you don't have a lot of experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't have a clever or insightful ending for this post, so, uh, I'd like to thank the readers for their valuable time and for the intelligent, thought-provoking comments that are sure to follow.</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Resting-Bear-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pleistocene was a time when giant mammals were common in Europe. One of them was the cave bear. This species is one of the most abundant fossil taxa from Europe due to its strategy of surviving the winter by resting, and consequently sometimes not surviving, in caves [1]. Thus, many fossil remains are perfectly preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most researchers agree that cave bears were predominantly herbivorous and mostly ate soft leaved plants such as herbs [2]. When I started my research on the brain size of cave bears, I was confronted with a short anecdote of the “stupid,” plant eating bear in the cave. The basis for this was the idea of an evolutionary brain size arms-race between predator and prey, where predators needed to always be smarter [3]. Here, it is important to note that overall or relative brain size does not necessarily reflect intelligence [4].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to look further into this anecdote and see if there is any validity to it. Thus, I started to collect data on dietary preferences of all studied bear species [2] and scored them on a scale where leaf consumption would result in small brains, and animal protein consumption in big brains. Additionally, I also wanted to see if the annual cycle of fattening up for the winter and starving until spring affected the costly brain matter [5].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9104&quot; style=&quot;width: 5716px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9104&quot; height=&quot;1554&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/MethodsPicture.jpg&quot; width=&quot;5706&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Difference in brain volume between polar bear (left) and cave bear (right) (skulls are stored in PIMUZ, Switzerland). Glasses are filled with 6 mm glass beads as representation of the different brain volumes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Kristof Veitschegger &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research showed that neither diet nor dormancy alone had a significant effect on the relative brain size of cave bears. Thus, the results do not give validity to the anecdote of the “stupid,” plant eating bear. However, there was a weak environmental influence that affected the brain size of cave bears as is shown in the combined score of diet and dormancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to understand the effect that body size had on the brain of cave bears. Cave bears were one of the biggest bear species ever to roam the earth and body mass estimations are between 225 and 1,500 kg [1, 6]. My research showed that the body mass of cave bears increased at a much higher pace than brain mass. Thus, cave bears ended up with small brains compared to their body size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are increasingly encouraged to communicate directly with non-experts, through newspaper and TV interviews, science festivals, online videos, and other channels. But the quality of their research or ideas alone is not enough to guarantee interest or support, suggests &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/05/16/1620542114.full&quot;&gt;a series of new studies&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;PNAS&lt;/i&gt;. The way the general public responds is also influenced by the scientist’s facial appearance, an important finding, say the researchers, because the public communication of scientific findings shapes beliefs, opinion and policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24667&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To probe the potential impact of first impressions, the researchers, led by William Skylark at the University of Cambridge, first obtained photographs of the faces of hundreds of male and female scientists, chosen at random from physics, genetics/human genetics and biological sciences departments of US and UK universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group of participants then rated these faces on a variety of social traits, relating to competence, sociability and morality (essentially, trustworthiness), as well as on attractiveness and perceived age. Other groups indicated how interested they would be in finding out more about each scientist’s research or how much the person looked like someone who conducts accurate and important research (the extent to which they looked like a “good scientist”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants were more interested in learning about the work of scientists who were physically attractive and who appeared competent and trustworthy (though sociability judgements had little effect). When it came to judgements of the quality of these scientists’ work, however, while apparent trustworthiness and competency were again important, those scientists who’d ranked &lt;i&gt;lower&lt;/i&gt; for physical attractiveness and sociability generally got better scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further study with a different group of volunteers found that they rated research (described in an apparent magazine article) as being of higher quality when it was paired with a photo of a scientist who’d previously received a high “good-scientist” rating, compared with research paired with a photo of a scientist with a lower “good scientist” rating. (In fact, the scientists in the photos were not responsible for the work described in the articles.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings show that the very traits, as judged from appearance, that can engage the general public in a scientist’s work are distinct from – and even opposite to – the traits that encourage the belief that the scientist does high-quality work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Notably, these sociocognitive traits ‘trumped’ the influence of age, gender, and ethnicity – variables that are the primary focus of much work on stereotypes and bias, implying an underlying source of influence that has received little attention public discourse or academic studies of scientist stereotypes,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of bias uncovered in this new research could have significant real-world implications. For example, in another of the new studies participants showed a preference for “interesting-looking” scientists when choosing which research videos they’d like to watch – a bias that would amount to tens or hundreds of thousands of extra views, the researchers noted. “Indeed the effect was particularly strong for video communications, and the rising use of video media such as TED talks means that face-based judgements are likely to play an increasing role in shaping the public’s engagement with scientific research,” Skylark and his colleagues wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because effective communication is increasingly important to scientists’ career progression, they argued, face-based biases may influence not just which scientists’ work gains popularity or acceptance among the public, but even which research is actually conducted, and by whom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings add to past research on superficial factors, such as the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn.2008.20040?journalCode=jocn&quot;&gt;jargon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.249/full&quot;&gt;imagery&lt;/a&gt;, and clarity in expression, that can influence whether a piece of scientific work is widely discussed and believed, or ignored and discredited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/05/16/1620542114.abstract&quot;&gt;Facial appearance affects science communication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

             Self-motion triggers complementary visual and vestibular reflexes supporting
                image-stabilization and balance. Translation through space produces one global
                pattern of retinal image motion (optic flow), rotation another. We examined the
                direction preferences of direction-sensitive ganglion cells (DSGCs) in flattened
                mouse retinas in vitro. Here we show that for each subtype of DSGC, direction
                preference varies topographically so as to align with specific translatory optic
                flow fields, creating a neural ensemble tuned for a specific direction of motion
                through space. Four cardinal translatory directions are represented, aligned with
                two axes of high adaptive relevance: the body and gravitational axes. One subtype
                maximizes its output when the mouse advances, others when it retreats, rises or
                falls. Two classes of DSGCs, namely, ON-DSGCs and ON-OFF-DSGCs, share the same
                spatial geometry but weight the four channels differently. Each subtype ensemble is
                also tuned for rotation. The relative activation of DSGC channels uniquely encodes
                every translation and rotation. Although retinal and vestibular systems both encode
                translatory and rotatory self-motion, their coordinate systems differ.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Human primordial germ cells (hPGCs), the precursors of sperm and eggs, originate during weeks 2–3 of early post-implantation development. Using in vitro models of hPGC induction, recent studies have suggested that there are marked mechanistic differences in the specification of human and mouse PGCs. This may be due in part to the divergence in their pluripotency networks and early post-implantation development. As early human embryos are not accessible for direct study, we considered alternatives including porcine embryos that, as in humans, develop as bilaminar embryonic discs. Here we show that porcine PGCs originate from the posterior pre-primitive-streak competent epiblast by sequential upregulation of SOX17 and BLIMP1 in response to WNT and BMP signalling. We use this model together with human and monkey in vitro models simulating peri-gastrulation development to show the conserved principles of epiblast development for competency for primordial germ cell fate. This process is followed by initiation of the epigenetic program and regulated by a balanced SOX17–BLIMP1 gene dosage. Our combinatorial approach using human, porcine and monkey in vivo and in vitro models provides synthetic insights into early human development.

		<link href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/Ds7y6mYk_AM/nature22797"/>

 &lt;p&gt;
 D-type cyclins (D1, D2 and D3) and their associated cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK6) are components of the core cell cycle machinery that drives cell proliferation. Inhibitors of CDK4 and CDK6 are currently being tested in clinical trials for patients with several cancer types, with promising results. Here, using human cancer cells and patient-derived xenografts in mice, we show that the cyclin D3–CDK6 kinase phosphorylates and inhibits the catalytic activity of two key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, 6-phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase M2. This re-directs the glycolytic intermediates into the pentose phosphate (PPP) and serine pathways. Inhibition of cyclin D3–CDK6 in tumour cells reduces flow through the PPP and serine pathways, thereby depleting the antioxidants NADPH and glutathione. This, in turn, increases the levels of reactive oxygen species and causes apoptosis of tumour cells. The pro-survival function of cyclin D-associated kinase operates in tumours expressing high levels of cyclin D3–CDK6 complexes. We propose that measuring the levels of cyclin D3–CDK6 in human cancers might help to identify tumour subsets that undergo cell death and tumour regression upon inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6. Cyclin D3–CDK6, through its ability to link cell cycle and cell metabolism, represents a particularly powerful oncoprotein that affects cancer cells at several levels, and this property can be exploited for anti-cancer therapy.

 Therapies that target signalling molecules that are mutated in cancers can often have substantial short-term effects, but the emergence of resistant cancer cells is a major barrier to full cures. Resistance can result from secondary mutations, but in other cases there is no clear genetic cause, raising the possibility of non-genetic rare cell variability. Here we show that human melanoma cells can display profound transcriptional variability at the single-cell level that predicts which cells will ultimately resist drug treatment. This variability involves infrequent, semi-coordinated transcription of a number of resistance markers at high levels in a very small percentage of cells. The addition of drug then induces epigenetic reprogramming in these cells, converting the transient transcriptional state to a stably resistant state. This reprogramming begins with a loss of SOX10-mediated differentiation followed by activation of new signalling pathways, partially mediated by the activity of the transcription factors JUN and/or AP-1 and TEAD. Our work reveals the multistage nature of the acquisition of drug resistance and provides a framework for understanding resistance dynamics in single cells. We find that other cell types also exhibit sporadic expression of many of these same marker genes, suggesting the existence of a general program in which expression is displayed in rare subpopulations of cells.

 Mammalian cells are surrounded by diverse nutrients, such as glucose, amino acids, various macromolecules and micronutrients, which they can import through transmembrane transporters and endolysosomal pathways. By using different nutrient sources, cells gain metabolic flexibility to survive periods of starvation. Quiescent cells take up sufficient nutrients to sustain homeostasis. However, proliferating cells depend on growth-factor-induced increases in nutrient uptake to support biomass formation. Here, we review cellular nutrient acquisition strategies and their regulation by growth factors and cell-intrinsic nutrient sensors. We also discuss how oncogenes and tumour suppressors promote nutrient uptake and thereby support the survival and growth of cancer cells.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Adaptive immune responses are tailored to different types of pathogens through differentiation of naive CD4 T cells into functionally distinct subsets of effector T cells (T helper 1 (TH1), TH2, and TH17) defined by expression of the key transcription factors T-bet, GATA3, and RORγt, respectively. Regulatory T (Treg) cells comprise a distinct anti-inflammatory lineage specified by the X-linked transcription factor Foxp3 (refs 2, 3). Paradoxically, some activated Treg cells express the aforementioned effector CD4 T cell transcription factors, which have been suggested to provide Treg cells with enhanced suppressive capacity. Whether expression of these factors in Treg cells—as in effector T cells—is indicative of heterogeneity of functionally discrete and stable differentiation states, or conversely may be readily reversible, is unknown. Here we demonstrate that expression of the TH1-associated transcription factor T-bet in mouse Treg cells, induced at steady state and following infection, gradually becomes highly stable even under non-permissive conditions. Loss of function or elimination of T-bet-expressing Treg cells—but not of T-bet expression in Treg cells—resulted in severe TH1 autoimmunity. Conversely, following depletion of T-bet− Treg cells, the remaining T-bet+ cells specifically inhibited TH1 and CD8 T cell activation consistent with their co-localization with T-bet+ effector T cells. These results suggest that T-bet+ Treg cells have an essential immunosuppressive function and indicate that Treg cell functional heterogeneity is a critical feature of immunological tolerance.

 &lt;p&gt;
 G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated signal transduction is central to human physiology and disease intervention, yet the molecular mechanisms responsible for ligand-dependent signalling responses remain poorly understood. In class A GPCRs, receptor activation and G-protein coupling entail outward movements of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6). Here, using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging, we examine TM6 movements in the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) upon exposure to orthosteric ligands with different efficacies, in the absence and presence of the Gs heterotrimer. We show that partial and full agonists differentially affect TM6 motions to regulate the rate at which GDP-bound β2AR–Gs complexes are formed and the efficiency of nucleotide exchange leading to Gs activation. These data also reveal transient nucleotide-bound β2AR–Gs species that are distinct from known structures, and provide single-molecule perspectives on the allosteric link between ligand- and nucleotide-binding pockets that shed new light on the G-protein activation mechanism.

 The mutant form of the GTPase KRAS is a key driver of pancreatic cancer but remains a challenging therapeutic target. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles generated by all cells, and are naturally present in the blood. Here we show that enhanced retention of exosomes, compared to liposomes, in the circulation of mice is likely due to CD47-mediated protection of exosomes from phagocytosis by monocytes and macrophages. Exosomes derived from normal fibroblast-like mesenchymal cells were engineered to carry short interfering RNA or short hairpin RNA specific to oncogenic KrasG12D, a common mutation in pancreatic cancer. Compared to liposomes, the engineered exosomes (known as iExosomes) target oncogenic KRAS with an enhanced efficacy that is dependent on CD47, and is facilitated by macropinocytosis. Treatment with iExosomes suppressed cancer in multiple mouse models of pancreatic cancer and significantly increased overall survival. Our results demonstrate an approach for direct and specific targeting of oncogenic KRAS in tumours using iExosomes.

 Fossil evidence points to an African origin of Homo sapiens from a group called either H. heidelbergensis or H. rhodesiensis. However, the exact place and time of emergence of H. sapiens remain obscure because the fossil record is scarce and the chronological age of many key specimens remains uncertain. In particular, it is unclear whether the present day ‘modern’ morphology rapidly emerged approximately 200 thousand years ago (ka) among earlier representatives of H. sapiens or evolved gradually over the last 400 thousand years. Here we report newly discovered human fossils from Jebel Irhoud, Morocco, and interpret the affinities of the hominins from this site with other archaic and recent human groups. We identified a mosaic of features including facial, mandibular and dental morphology that aligns the Jebel Irhoud material with early or recent anatomically modern humans and more primitive neurocranial and endocranial morphology. In combination with an age of 315 ± 34 thousand years (as determined by thermoluminescence dating), this evidence makes Jebel Irhoud the oldest and richest African Middle Stone Age hominin site that documents early stages of the H. sapiens clade in which key features of modern morphology were established. Furthermore, it shows that the evolutionary processes behind the emergence of H. sapiens involved the whole African continent.

 The timing and location of the emergence of our species and of associated behavioural changes are crucial for our understanding of human evolution. The earliest fossil attributed to a modern form of Homo sapiens comes from eastern Africa and is approximately 195 thousand years old, therefore the emergence of modern human biology is commonly placed at around 200 thousand years ago. The earliest Middle Stone Age assemblages come from eastern and southern Africa but date much earlier. Here we report the ages, determined by thermoluminescence dating, of fire-heated flint artefacts obtained from new excavations at the Middle Stone Age site of Jebel Irhoud, Morocco, which are directly associated with newly discovered remains of H. sapiens. A weighted average age places these Middle Stone Age artefacts and fossils at 315 ± 34 thousand years ago. Support is obtained through the recalculated uranium series with electron spin resonance date of 286 ± 32 thousand years ago for a tooth from the Irhoud 3 hominin mandible. These ages are also consistent with the faunal and microfaunal assemblages and almost double the previous age estimates for the lower part of the deposits. The north African site of Jebel Irhoud contains one of the earliest directly dated Middle Stone Age assemblages, and its associated human remains are the oldest reported for H. sapiens. The emergence of our species and of the Middle Stone Age appear to be close in time, and these data suggest a larger scale, potentially pan-African, origin for both.

&lt;p&gt;After a terror attack, amidst the shock and sadness, there is simple incomprehension: how could anyone be so brutal, so inhuman? In &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0118&quot;&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Sandra Baez and her colleagues offer rare insight based on their tests of 66 incarcerated paramilitary terrorists in Colombia, who had murdered an average of 33 victims each. The terrorists completed measures of their intelligence, aggression, emotion recognition, and crucially, their moral judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24692&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On most measures, such as intelligence and executive function, there were no differences between the terrorists and 66 non-terrorist control participants from the same region. The terrorists admitted to more aggression, as you’d expect, and they showed difficulties recognising anger, sadness and disgust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the most striking group difference concerned moral judgments on 24 different scenarios. Unlike control participants, the terrorists judged acts of intended harm with neutral outcomes (such as intending to poison someone, but failing) to be more morally permissible than acts of accidental harm (such as poisoning someone by mistake). In a follow-up, the terrorists also rated attempted harm as more morally permissible than accidental harm, as compared with a group of incarcerated non-terrorist murderers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baez and her team said this distorted approach to morality implies a problem weighing intentions combined with an excessive focus on outcomes, and it is similar to the moral perspective taken by very young children and by adult neurological patients with damage to the frontal lobe and temporal lobe of their brains (but not by psychopaths who do seem to weigh intentions when making their moral judgments).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The profile observed in the terrorists may reflect their fixation on utopian visions whereby only (idealised) ends matter. That is, their outcome-based moral judgments may be related to the belief that any action can be justified,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research involved Colombian terrorists who had joined paramilitary organisations mainly for economic rather than ideological reasons. It remains to be seen if the specific deviant moral code uncovered in this research is also a characteristic of Islamist terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A promising avenue for future investigation, the researchers noted, will be to see if careful tests of moral judgment could be used to predict likelihood of future offending in dangerous offenders; also to study whether and how radicalisation alters the nature of people’s moral judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0118&quot;&gt;Outcome-oriented moral evaluation in terrorists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;Yesterday I signed my contract renewal, and in August of this year I officially begin my third year as a professor in the Physics Department at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). Several friends and family have been asking me what comes next in terms of promotion and tenure, so I thought an update might be a nice way to revive this quiet blog. First, some background…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally entered my current position by responding to a open call for applications.  A few years ago, the university launched a new Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Physics, and in 2015 they opened up a search for faculty. I was one of two (both women!) professors offered a position that round. I officially started on August 1, 2015. Here’s where things vary from the system many academics in Canada, the U.S., and U.K. might be used to. Professors here in Mexico do not begin their faculty positions on the tenure track. For the first three years, we are on annual contract renewal, meaning I sign for one year at a time and my next year’s contract is based on an evaluation by the review board. Each December/January, I submit a progress report describing my teaching, research, service, etc., accomplishments for the year, and submit a new work plan outlining what I intend to accomplish in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, I have not received any official comments back on my evaluations; I simply know my annual review was successful when a letter arrives to my office informing me that my contract has been renewed. For this reason, it’s a little difficult for me to assess what the review board thinks of my progress so far, or if there are specific areas where they think I could improve.  The only unofficial comment has come from my program coordinator, who said the review board would like to see me publish more. I can’t disagree. But I do have two articles nearly ready to submit, so I’m hopeful my production will increase this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far, the toughest thing about my first two years has been the teaching load. Our minimum teaching load is 9 classroom hours per week, which works out to 2.5-3 classes per semester. I currently teach most of the bio- and physiology-related core courses for the program, including Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Biology, Human Physiology, Physics of the Human Body, and sometimes Intro to Physical Chemistry or Measurement and Analysis in Experimental Physics, depending on the semester and course demand. Only this semester did I begin to repeat courses, and was able to build on previous class preparation, rather than having to start entirely from scratch. This and a couple of great teaching aids this semester made a huge difference, and am hoping this trend continues. On another good note, my teaching evaluations have been very positive, and interactions with some great groups of students have been a highlight of my faculty experience so far. I have no shortage of passionate and interested students. The questions from them in class this semester got tough, but I think that’s a good problem to have!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I applied for and received my first grants as a Principal Investigator. Both grants are internal to UNAM, and each is for a maximum amount equivalent to around $10,000 USD, enough to buy some small equipment and consumables for the lab. A lab space wasn’t originally part of my hiring package, but by joining forces with a professor in Biology and another in Mathematics and collectively bringing in funding from a few different sources, we now have a collaborative space that is used for both original research and training activities. One of my grants is for a research project to study aging in the hippocampus, both computationally and experimentally. All the code, data, and research products generated will be shared under open licenses. The other grant is a teaching grant to develop electrophysiology laboratory practicals for the Biomedical Physics undergrad program. All the materials produced under that grant will be shared as open educational resources. Overall, I’m hugely grateful to have funding and a lab space I didn’t think I would ever have. But I must admit it is daunting and slightly terrifying to now have to deliver all the things I promised in my proposals!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that’s where things stand nearing the end of year two. What comes next? Year three is a critical year. Right now, I am not yet eligible for promotion or tenure. To become eligible, I will first have to win a public competition for my position (another, apart from the one I successfully won to be given the position in the first place). In short, a job description is written up, reviewed by internal committees, and then published in our university newspaper. The ‘test’ materials that have to be submitted for the application vary by department, and in my case will most likely include at least a research proposal and a critical essay on some aspect of the plan of study or core course in Biomedical Physics. Departments may also ask for other ‘tests’, such as oral presentations or essays on current issues in your field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although you are intended to be the ideal candidate for the job — the description is such that it fits your profile and you have a history with the university after having taught there for three years by the time the process is complete – -anyone can apply for the position. And the position can be taken away from you if the review committee prefers another candidate in the competition. It is not clear how often this happens, but it has happened enough that I know of multiple cases. If this occurs, that will most likely be the end of my stint as a faculty member at UNAM. My position will be taken over by the new person, and I will be asked to leave. It is possible I could be offered the equivalent of an adjunct position, paid per class, but I would not be eligible for promotion and tenure. This is why it is so important that I have all the boxes checked (good course evaluations, papers published, projects funded, students graduated, etc.) and can strongly demonstrate my worth to the department by the time the public competition for my position opens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The departmental process of writing the announcement, going through rounds of edits with internal review boards (there are rules about how these things should be phrased and what can be specified or not), and finally publishing the competition announcement can take up to a year. If you’re wondering why it takes so long, here is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fciencias.unam.mx/comunidad/academicos/plazas&quot;&gt;flow chart provided by the Faculty of Science&lt;/a&gt; that explains all the steps involved in preparing and publishing the announcement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;COA&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2927&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;2927&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;COA&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://emckiernan.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/coa.png?w=736?w=736&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://emckiernan.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/coa.png?w=736?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://emckiernan.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/coa.png?w=736&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1099,895&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://emckiernan.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/update-on-life-as-a-new-prof/coa/&quot; src=&quot;https://emckiernan.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/coa.png?w=736&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Totally clear, right?! Anyway, this process should begin in August so that it is complete by the time I finish my third year. If I am successful in winning the public competition, the position will then officially be in my name. I’ve had some difficulty understanding exactly how all these processes work, since they are few official guidelines. But if I understand correctly, I should then be able to immediately request promotion and tenure. I am not sure exactly what I will need to submit to accomplish this or what the criteria are for a successful application; these are things I’m hoping to verify after the publication competition. Tenure comes with obvious benefits and stability, but promotion has its perks, too. Moving up to the next level will reduce my minimum teaching load from 9 to 6 classroom hours per week and allow me to advise doctoral students at UNAM (there are sometimes ways to do this before moving up, but it’s more complicated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that’s about it. In sum, I’m feeling very positive about how things have been going so far, but also a little apprehensive about what comes next. The only thing I can keep telling myself is, I am giving this my best shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With political tribalism a feature of our times, perhaps science could act as a unifying force. While faith in politicians and journalists is in the doldrums, surveys in countries like &lt;a href=&quot;http://angusreidglobal/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012.10.02_Professions.pdf&quot;&gt;Britain, Canada and the US&lt;/a&gt; suggest scientists are among the most respected professions, and citizens are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.people-press.org/2009/07/09/public-praises-science-scientists-fault-public-media/&quot;&gt;appreciative&lt;/a&gt; of the contribution science makes to their lives. As the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0079&quot;&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/i&gt; note, it seems that “we may disagree on emotionally charged social issues, but at least we can agree on science&lt;i&gt;”.  &lt;/i&gt;Sadly, their findings show that it’s not so simple. Although politically diverse people may be fans of science, we’re not fans of the same science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24637&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by Feng Shi at the University of Chicago, explored the book-buying habits of tens of millions of Americans by analysing two huge datasets belonging to Amazon and Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, which encoded the purchase patterns that make possible recommendations like “customers who bought this item also bought…”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers coded over a million books in the databases: about half a million covered topics like art, fiction and sports; there were over 400,000 science books, categorised into different domains like life sciences and further into disciplines like medicine; and finally, there were political books, from which the researchers identified nearly 600 emphatically liberal books and another 700 conservative ones. The key question was, what other books were buyers of these “blue” (liberal-left in US parlance) and “red” (conservative) books also buying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, science books were more likely to be read by people also reading political books, regardless of ideology. And many disciplines of science, like chemistry or economics, were of similar interest to both red and blue readers. So far, so good. But many other disciplines were more favoured by one tribe. Liberals were far more drawn to engineering, anthropology, and purer sciences like biology, astronomy or to a lesser extent physics. Conservatives were drawn more to applied disciplines such as medicine and law, and – in the highest association for the red tribe – climate science. (This may seem surprising, but we’ll come back to it shortly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, when you scrutinise the sciences that appear to be equally favoured, you find polarisation is still happening, just at a more fine-grained level. Digging into chemistry, for example, reveals its most applied branch (organic) is very strongly red whereas zoology is exceptionally blue. Even within subfields that have interest to both tribes, like criminology, conservatives and liberals are siloed into reading different authors (palaeontology was one of the rare exceptions to this rule).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science books read by conservative readers also tended to be less varied, such as the same three climate books cropping up repeatedly, whereas liberals tended to read more widely across an area. The conservatives narrower choices also appeared to contain more fringe publications rather than core texts. This may explain why the analysis appeared to suggest that conservatives are more interested in climate change: they were dipping into the same minority of books sceptical of climate change, but generally they weren’t reading on the topic more widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anonymous purchasing patterns may provide access to true preferences, getting round the potential problem of people hiding their unpopular beliefs in surveys. That said, the new findings may give a somewhat distorted picture of people’s true interests because the recommendation algorithm used by Amazon and Barnes &amp;amp; Noble pushes similar consumers towards the same choices (even so, the findings still provide another demonstration of the way filter bubbles may be shaping how we approach the world). Together with the filter effect, the authors also consider the possibility that “scientific puzzles appeal more to the left, while problem-solving appeals more to the right” as an explanation for the preferences for pure and applied science respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science is a powerful engine for finding truth. But truth pursued too selectively can cause problems, in this case via political cultures each with a partial picture of the world, each &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/25/new-studies-suggest-liberals-are-as-blinkered-and-biased-as-conservatives/&quot;&gt;increasingly talking past the other&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a big problem to tackle, but also a reminder that if we’re willing to poke our heads above the parapet, there’s an unseen world out there just waiting for our attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0079&quot;&gt;Millions of online book co-purchases reveal partisan differences in the consumption of science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Marco Craveiro's journal club session where he presents the paper, &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11877028_2&quot;&gt;Model Driven Engineering: An Emerging Technical Space (Bézivin, 2006)&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an emerging solution to the handling of complex and evolving
software systems, Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is still very much in
evolution. The industrial demand is quite high while the research
answer for a sound set of foundation principles is still far from
being stabilized. Therefore it is important to provide a current state
of the art in MDE, describing what its origins are, what its present
state is, and where it seems to be presently leading. One important
question is how MDE relates to other contemporary technologies. This
tutorial proposes the ”technical space” concept to this purpose. The
two main objectives are to present first the basic MDE principles and
second how these principles may be mapped onto modern platform
support. Other issues that will be discussed are the applicability of
these ideas, concepts, and tools to solve current practical problems.
Various organizations and companies (OMG, IBM, Microsoft, etc.) are
currently proposing several environments claiming to support MDE.
Among these, the OMG MDATM(Model Driven Architecture) has a special
place since it was historically one of the original proposals in this
area. This work focuses on the identification of basic MDE principles,
practical characteristics of MDE (direct representation, automation,
and open standards), original MDE scenarios, and discussions of
suitable tools and methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objectives of this talk are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide a general overview of Model Driven Engineering (MDE)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cover some of the difficulties of this approach&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure to reproduce established psychology findings on &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/&quot;&gt;renewed testing&lt;/a&gt;, including some &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/16/ten-famous-psychology-findings-that-its-been-difficult-to-replicate/&quot;&gt;famous effects&lt;/a&gt;, has been well-publicised and has led to talk of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/25/was-the-crisis-in-social-psychology-really-that-bad-have-things-improved-part-one-the-researchers-perspective/&quot;&gt;crisis&lt;/a&gt; in the field. However, psychology is a vast topic and there’s a possibility that the findings from some sub-disciplines may be more robust than others, in the sense of replicating reliably, even in unfavourable circumstances, such as when the participants have been tested on the same effect before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/rbz29&quot;&gt;new paper currently available as a preprint at PsyArXiv&lt;/a&gt; has tested whether this might be the case for nine key findings from cognitive psychology, related to perception, memory and learning. Rolf Zwaan at Erasumus University Rotterdam and his colleagues found that all nine effects replicated reliably. “These results represent good news for the field of psychology,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24474&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested hundreds of participants on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk survey website. Whichever cognitive effect they were tested on, each participant completed the test twice (either with the exact same stimuli or new versions), to see whether it made any difference to their behaviour or responses if they already had experience of the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, all the effects in question were replicated on all occasions, whether on the first or second testing, and regardless of whether the specific stimuli – such as the words or pictures involved – were familiar or completely new.  The nine cognitive effects that showed this robustness were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Simon Effect&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants had to press computer keys to indicate as fast as possible the colour of a on-screen circle. They were faster to respond if the appropriate keyboard key was on the same side of space as the circle they were responding to. This facilitatory effect of “stimulus-response” consistency is important for the design of human-machine interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Flanker Task&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants had to press the correct keyboard key as fast as possible to indicate whether a target stimulus was a vowel or consonant. Participants were faster to respond if the target was surrounded by distracting letters associated with the same response (e.g. a target vowel surrounded by irrelevant, distracting vowels), as opposed to being surrounded by distractors associated with a different response (e.g. a vowel surrounded by consonants). The task shows how we can’t help but process irrelevant information to a certain degree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motor Priming&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants had to press the appropriate keyboard key as fast as possible in response to left- or right-facing arrows flashed on-screen. Preceding arrows (known as a prime) gave advance warning of which way the target arrows would point: sometimes these primes were accurate, which led to faster performance, as you’d expect; if the primes pointed the wrong way, they slowed performance. Crucially, some of the primes were “masked” to make them subliminal (i.e. not consciously visible), in which case the effects were reversed, with primes pointing the wrong way leading to faster responses. The finding shows how information that’s not consciously perceived can affect our behaviour, and that it can have an opposite effect when subliminal than when consciously perceived.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spacing Effect&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants were presented with dozens of words in sequence, with some of the words shown more than once in quick succession (i.e. the repetitions appeared close together in the sequence, known as “massing”); the repetition of other words was spread out in the sequence with other words appearing in-between (known as “spacing”). Tested on their memory for the words later, participants showed superior memory for the spaced words than the massed words, a basic phenomenon of memory that has important implications for learning and study.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;False Memories&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants were shown sequences of words of related meaning. Tested on their memory of the words later, participants were more likely to mistakenly say that a new word of similar meaning had been present in the earlier sequence than a new word with a meaning unrelated to the earlier list. This is a basic demonstration of the fallibility of memory and how easy it is to feel like we’ve experienced something before when we haven’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serial Position Effect&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants were challenged to remember lists of twenty words. They later showed better memory for words that appeared near the beginning and end of the lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associative Priming&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants had to indicate as fast as possible whether target words flashed on-screen were real words or non-words. They were faster to identify target real words if they’d been preceded by a word (a “prime”) of related meaning, consistent with the idea that activation spreads through networks of related information in the mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repetition Priming&lt;/strong&gt;: Presented with lists of words, some more common than others, participants had to indicate as fast as possible whether each word was a real word or a non-word. Some lists were repeated. Participants were faster to make their judgments when re-tested on a word shown earlier, and this priming effect was more pronounced for less common words – a finding that shows an interesting interaction between short-term memory (based on a recent encounter of a word) and long-term memory (based on how common the word is).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Shape simulation&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants were shown successive pairs of sentences and pictures. For each picture they had to say whether the object it presented had featured in the preceding sentence. Participants were quicker to respond correctly to picture-sentence matches when the orientation of the object was similar in both cases – for example, if the sentence “The ranger saw the eagle in the sky” was followed by an image of a flying eagle as opposed to a perched eagle. The finding shows how we automatically represent the visual images implied by sentences we’ve read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zwaan and his colleagues said these positive findings are particularly encouraging, at least for cognitive psychology, because an increasing amount of research on memory and perception is now conducted online via Amazon Mechanical Turk and other survey websites. Also, the fact that these psychological phenomena held up even when the same participants were tested for a second time shows that they reflect fundamental, unchanging aspects of how our minds work. “It appears that these tasks are so constraining that they encapsulate behaviour from contextual variation and even from recent relevant experiences to yield highly reproducible effects,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/fotolia_300251-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canine obesity needs to be regarded as a serious issue and one that can no longer be ignored. The dilemma is that an overweight dog is more difficult to exercise, as obesity gives rise to respiratory and musculoskeletal issues that also have a negative impact on a dog’s quality of life and an already short lifespan.  Obesity can also increase the risk of other chronic diseases such as canine diabetes and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1746-6148-10-131&quot;&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, making canine obesity an important health concern in veterinary medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-016-0899-x&quot;&gt;Weight control diets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-016-0899-x&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-9095 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/fotolia_694386-300x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and programs for dogs are met with varied success, and it has been reported that few dogs are able to maintain their optimal body weight if they have developed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1746-6148-8-147&quot;&gt;metabolic disorder &lt;/a&gt;linked to being overweight. As such, prevention is always better than the cure, and knowledge of predictive markers linked to canine obesity would certainly help to control this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although studies in human obesity have identified that a high birth weight and weight-gain during growth are classed as early risk factors for obesity in adulthood, it was not known if the same was true of dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-017-0994-7&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research &lt;/em&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt;, a group of researchers from &lt;em&gt;LUNAM University&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Nantes-Atlantic College of Veterinary Medicine&lt;/em&gt; in France performed a longitudinal study in growing dogs to investigate predictive factors that could explain becoming overweight and obese in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beagle dogs from ten different litters were kept in a controlled environment and followed for two years after birth. Keeping dogs in identical conditions enabled researchers to measure growth, body composition and hormonal variations throughout maturation with reduced external variables. Although the sample size was small, the study did demonstrate differences in the development of obesity and becoming overweight between dogs matched for age, sex and breed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was determined that some dogs, despite being from the same breed and kept in the same conditions, are more susceptible to fat gain.  Body weight of the mother and father were positively correlated to that of their offspring, highlighting a possible parental link to canine obesity that requires further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike humans, neonatal bodyweight did not appear to be correlated with becoming overweight later in life. The earliest predictive marker was thought to be at 2 weeks after birth, where it was observed that puppies which had a growth rate greater than 125% were significantly more likely to be in the “overweight” group; a finding that is comparable to human studies, which have shown that high weight gain in early life stages is associated with the development of adult obesity. However, it was unclear whether the dam’s milk and/or litter size had an impact on the overweight status. &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-9097 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;204&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/fotolia_100220-300x204.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These preliminary results are encouraging, and such knowledge about predictive factors of obesity should be used by breeders and veterinarians to make dietary recommendations earlier in life. Dogs with a high growth rate during the first two weeks and high body composition score at 7 months should be started on a restricted diet early on, to ensure dogs maintain a healthy weight and better quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always advise speaking to your veterinarian if you are concerned about your dog’s weight before placing them on a calorie controlled diet.  However, we hope that a greater awareness of the causes and risks of canine obesity will help to “slim down” (sorry!) this current epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;

Here we present our conversation with Sandra Schmid from University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_7605&quot; style=&quot;width: 214px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7605 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/06/Dr.-Sandra-Schmid-214x300.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Image Credit: University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center&quot; width=&quot;214&quot; /&gt;Image Credit: University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Sandra Schmid has gained a reputation for academic strength and leadership, most recently as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/131128/sandra-schmid.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Professor and Chairman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of the cell biology department at University of Texas Southwestern (UTSW) Medical Center. She’s also gained a reputation for her honesty regarding varied issues, including the position of post-docs, “if it were a job, we’d pay you better and give you retirement benefits,” the training of faculty, “few of us as mentors, as Principal Investigators, were ever taught how to run a lab or how to mentor individuals” and how she participates in open discussion of research before publication “mostly over beers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schmid has been particularly vocal about the misuse of journal impact factors (JIFs) as a way to evaluate researchers and, as she claims, “the unfortunate consequences to the scientific community of their misuse.” At UTSW, Schmid’s home institution, there has been no overt discussion among the leadership regarding JIFs and where faculty should choose to publish. There is no formalized preference for high impact journals. “In fact, we celebrated the founding of &lt;em&gt;eLIFE&lt;/em&gt; [a journal which rejects the use of JIFs] and have faculty on the Editorial Board of the journal,” says Schmid. The JIF was “never intended to and indeed does not measure the quality or impact of the individual papers in a journal,” says Schmid. It was originally developed and commercialized by Eugene Garfield to help librarians decide on which journals they should spend their subscription dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals and institutions are being spuriously judged – by other scientists, funders, governing bodies and administrators – based indirectly on JIF, rather than directly on the quality and impact of their work,” Schmid wrote in “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/pls/web/docs/F-698959692/duzSpecial_AvH_M04_2015_WEB.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Negative Consequences of the Misuse of Journal Impact Factors for Scientific Assessment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” as part of the 8th Forum on the Internationalization of Sciences and Humanities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flawed Statistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JIF is a statistic calculated based on the average citations of a selection of papers in a given journal. One major problem with the JIF is that citations are highly skewed, with most articles receiving fewer citations. Since citation distributions are skewed, averages are meaningless. “Indeed,” writes Schmid, there are journals that “flaunt their JIF in marketing material to authors that would ironically not accept papers reporting such flawed statistics.” This skewed distribution was clearly demonstrated last year through a collaboration between multiple publishers, including Université de Montréal, Imperial College London, PLOS, &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;EMBO Journal&lt;/em&gt;, The Royal Society, &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; (see &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/07/impact-factors-do-not-reflect-citation-rates/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Measuring Up: Impact Factors Do Not Reflect Article Citation Rates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;). The analysis, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/05/062109&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;posted on bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, showed that citation distributions of journals with clearly distinct impact factors greatly overlap—in other words that all journals publish many papers with similar lower numbers of citations, and few highly cited papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Better Option: Citation Distributions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the bioRxiv analysis call for publishers to make publicly available the actual citation distributions of their journal’s articles, rather than rely on irrelevant and misleading JIFs. Since journals use many different techniques to artificially increase their impact factor, including publication of review articles (which are often more highly cited than the original research papers they review) and front matter, including commentary and mini-review articles (that generate citations but are not counted as “citable” content) comparison across journals is problematic. It is hoped that public disclosure of article citation distributions will lead to more granular comparisons and better informed decisions by authors on where to submit their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then and Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/schmid/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;senior investigator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with a long-established career and history of publishing quality work at all tiers of influence, what has changed for Schmid when deciding where to publish is that in the past, “journals had different purposes and different scopes” and that was good. Before there was the JIF there was an understanding of what journal went with what type of data. “We sent our best biochemistry to &lt;em&gt;Journal of Biological Chemistry&lt;/em&gt;; our best cell biology to &lt;em&gt;Journal of Cell Biology&lt;/em&gt;. If we happened upon a new and potentially important discovery, even before we understood mechanism, we’d communicate it rapidly in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; because they were three figure papers.” Before the advent of supplemental materials, more meaty, in-depth studies were published in non-page limited, subject-specific journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked in the post-print era, how do researchers decide where to publish, Schmid replies, “That is the unfortunate part.” A lot of the decisions are being made by postdocs telling her about impact factors, although she cautions that “publishing in high impact factor journals doesn’t mean it’s high quality work.” Early career researchers are looking at numbers as a distinguisher between journals, says Schmid, so her efforts are focused on getting these scientists to think more broadly. Her response and recommendation? First and foremost is to choose the journal where the work will get in front of the audience that matters the most. Schmid is crystal clear when outlining her main considerations for deciding where to publish her work and the work from her lab:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are the people who handle my paper able to identify qualified referees?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are the editors going to understand the discussion and criticisms and be helpful in handling my papers; do they understand my field?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do my peers read and respect the content in this journal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unintended Consequences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real question for Schmid is how to get the “impact factor genie” as she calls it, “back in the box.” Why is this so important? Scientists and publishers often focus on the limitations of JIFs and the benefits of evaluating work at the article rather than journal level. However, there are more than just limitations to the JIF. According to Schmid there are very “specific and unintended consequences of the abuse of JIF as a tool for individual and institutional assessment.” Many of these, she notes, are direct; others are subtle, downstream ramifications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deferred communication of discoveries that might launch new fields as reviewers and editors demand more information per paper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discouraged follow-up or augmentative studies to verify results due to over-interpretation of findings for the purpose of artificially inflating a work’s value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misguided evaluation of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty by their individual papers rather than the combinatorial impact of their work in context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wasted time and resources spent satisfying unnecessary demands of reviewers and editors in high-impact journals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demoralized early career researchers forced to package an entire thesis or postdoctoral project into one comprehensive paper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Better Option: Article-Level Metrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps wanting to get that impact factor genie back in the box was more than a mistaken mixing of two idioms. The difficulty of reverting to a situation that formerly existed (putting the genie back in the bottle) combined with the repercussions of doing something that causes unexpected and unintended negative consequences (opening a Pandora’s box) does describe the situation the scientific community has with JIFs. Fortunately, this is not an impossible situation to remedy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/article-level-metrics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article-Level Metrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were developed by PLOS as a better means to assess research value in an electronically networked world. They are gaining acceptance across a broad swath of the scientific community, from scientists to funders and more, since they provide granularity, breadth and proximity (PLOS ALMs are updated daily to monthly, depending on source and age of the individual article). ALMs also allow different scholarly research outputs to be tracked, such as policy impact, datasets, software and code. Schmid also recommends simply using PubMed as a portal for assessing the influence of an article, stating, “from title to abstract to download is a good metric,” although not as complete as a suite of ALMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership in Practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 as Schmid took up the position of Chair of the Department of Cell Biology at UTSW, she offered an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2013/09/beyond-cvs-and-impact-factors-employers-manifesto&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;employer’s manifesto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (published as a &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; Careers column) on the approach her department would take in hiring new assistant professors. This manifesto promised “a better job of screening applicants—and to avoid inappropriate criteria such as journal impact factors.” The idea was to encourage applications from qualified candidates who “might feel sidelined because their paper has yet to be, or perhaps won’t be, published in a high-impact journal.” Schmid closed her column with an enthusiastic “Let’s run this experiment!” Four years later, she shared some of the results with PLOS. Using their Academic Jobs portal the entire faculty is engaged in viewing applicants and every candidate that has piqued the interest of even one faculty member is interviewed via Skype, removing the need for reaching a ‘consensus’ that might rely more on JIFs. Those few candidates whose programs are most likely to thrive in the department’s specific environment are invited to campus to visit. Since taking this approach “our new faculty are indeed thriving,” says Schmid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This approach suggests that a reduction on emphasis of JIFs in favor of more constructive and meaningful measures of evaluation, both quantitative and qualitative, fosters an assessment program that is both fair and thoughtful. This is how science should be; if it works for people it can work for research outputs as well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandra Schmid is Cecil H. Green Distinguished Chair in Cellular and Molecular Biology, Professor and Chairman, Department of Cell Biology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. She was co-founding editor of &lt;em&gt;Traffic&lt;/em&gt;, Editor-in-Chief of &lt;em&gt;Molecular Biology of the Cell&lt;/em&gt; and president of the American Society for Cell Biology. Schmid was elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and Vice-Chair of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Scientific Advisory Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

 The regenerative capacity of the adult mammalian heart is limited because of the reduced ability of cardiomyocytes (CMs) to progress through mitosis1. The regenerative capacity of endogenous CMs exists at birth but is lost postnatally, with subsequent organ growth occurring through CM hypertrophy2,3. The Hippo pathway, a conserved kinase cascade, inhibits CM proliferation in the developing heart to control heart size and in the adult heart to prevent regeneration4,5. The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC), a multicomponent transmembrane complex linking the actin cytoskeleton to extracellular matrix, is essential for CM homeostasis. DGC deficiency in humans results in muscular dystrophy, including lethal Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). We found that the DGC component dystroglycan 1 (DAG1) directly binds to Hippo pathway effector Yap to inhibit CM proliferation. The Yap-DAG1 interaction was enhanced by Hippo-induced Yap phosphorylation, revealing a connection between Hippo pathway function and the DGC. After injury, Hippo-deficient postnatal hearts maintained organ size control by repairing the defect with correct dimensions, whereas postnatal hearts doubly deficient for Hippo and the DGC showed CM overproliferation at the injury site. In mature Mdx mouse hearts—a model of DMD—Hippo deficiency protected against overload-induced heart failure.

 &lt;p&gt;
 The adult mammalian heart is non-regenerative due to the post-mitotic nature of cardiomyocytes. The neonatal mouse heart can regenerate, but only for the first week of life. Here we show that changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) during this week can affect cardiomyocyte growth and differentiation in mice. We identify Agrin, a component of neonatal ECM, as required for the full regenerative capacity of neonatal mouse hearts. In vitro, recombinant Agrin promotes the division of mouse and human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes via a mechanism that involves the disassembly of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex and Yap and ERK-mediated signaling. In vivo, a single administration of Agrin promotes cardiac regeneration in adult mice after myocardial infarction, although the degree of cardiomyocyte proliferation observed in this model suggests additional therapeutic mechanisms. Collectively, we uncover a new inducer of mammalian heart regeneration, highlighting fundamental roles of the ECM in cardiac repair.
