 &lt;p&gt;On December 9, 2019, a cloud of steam and volcanic gases blasted out of New Zealand’s Whakaari, or White Island, volcano. Relative to eruptions at other volcanoes, the explosion was small. But it claimed the lives of 22 people and injured another 25, many of whom suffered severe burns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, using high-resolution satellite data and computer algorithms, scientists have revealed &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abg1218&quot;&gt;how gases released by the volcano subtly changed&lt;/a&gt; before, during and after the 2019 eruption. Observing such small changes using satellites could greatly improve volcano monitoring and help spot early warnings of eruptions, the researchers report June 18 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Volcanologists typically use instruments on the ground to help warn of eruptions, monitoring changes in gases, such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, that quietly seep from volcanoes between blasts. But only around 50 of the world’s volcanoes are monitored in this way. Satellites have been used to study the plumes of large volcanoes, but the orbiting crafts haven’t been used to detect gases emitted by small eruptions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compared with large eruptions, like the blast that decapitated Washington’s Mount St. Helens in 1980, small-scale eruptions occur more often. So they pose a greater threat to people, says volcanologist Mike Burton of the University of Manchester in England.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image of Whakaari crater&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100659&quot; height=&quot;452&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061721_no_volcano_inline_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100659&quot;&gt;This bird’s-eye view provides a peek into the crater of Whakaari, or White Island, an active volcano that sits nearly 50 kilometers northeast of New Zealand’s North Island, in the Bay of Plenty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100659&quot;&gt;Krzysztof Belczyński/Flickr (&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/&quot;&gt;CC BY-SA 2.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By chance, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-5p&quot;&gt;Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite&lt;/a&gt; flew over Whakaari about an hour after the 2019 eruption and collected data on light reflected from the volcano’s plume of ejected gases with its Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument, or TROPOMI. “What we realized was that we could use [satellites] to actually look at unprecedentedly small explosions,” Burton says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From its seat in the sky, TROPOMI was better suited than ground instruments to gather information about the high-rising plume. And by the time TROPOMI passed overhead, much of the ash and other airborne particles that can blur ground observations of erupted gases had fallen out or evaporated from the plume.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Burton and his colleagues applied a computer algorithm to the TROPOMI data to calculate the backward trajectory of gases in the plume — essentially rewinding the volcanic eruption. This approach allowed the researchers to estimate how much sulfur dioxide that the volcano belched before, during and after the eruption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Roughly 40 minutes before Whakaari erupted, the volcano’s sulfur dioxide emissions increased from 10 kilograms per second to 45 kilograms per second — signaling a potential eruption — and the plume of sulfur dioxide and other gases began to rise, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GeoNet, a New Zealand geological hazard monitoring service, had raised an alert several weeks before the eruption, after detecting an uptick of ground tremor, geysers bubbling up in the volcano’s crater lake and sulfur dioxide emissions using ground instruments, though tour companies continued to visit the island. But the new study is the first time that scientists have used a satellite to detect precursory changes in sulfur dioxide emissions before a small eruption.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It was surprising that so much information about this small eruption could be gleaned using satellites, Burton says. “That’s a really exciting prospect because we can now expect to [measure] many more [eruptions] from space”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Changes in tremors caused by the eruption were recorded by a seismic station on the island and paralleled the researchers’ results. As sulfur dioxide emissions and plume height began to grow in the minutes before the blast, tremors increased, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This work shows that it’s now possible to measure gas emissions preceding small eruptions using satellites, which will complement ground-based systems and help provide warnings before eruptions, says, Jorge Andres Diaz a volcanologist at the University of Costa Rica in San Pedro, who was not involved in the study. “It [could] be your first line of monitoring, especially in places that are very remote.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But predicting eruptions involves looking at multiple factors together, including those that TROPOMI can’t detect, he says. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dormant-russia-volcano-bolshaya-udina-waking-complicated&quot;&gt;Tremors&lt;/a&gt; are one example (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/17/19&lt;/em&gt;). It’s also useful to monitor other emitted gases like carbon dioxide that, in conjunction with sulfur dioxide measurements, can reveal when new magma flushes into a volcano’s magma chamber, which can lead to an eruption. While TROPOMI can’t detect carbon dioxide, some other satellites can.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want to say we can forecast explosions perfectly; we can’t do that,” Burton says. “But this is a key step. It opens up a whole new frontier.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Some big scientific discoveries aren’t actually discovered. They are borrowed. That’s what happened when scientists enlisted proteins from an unlikely lender: green algae.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cells of the algal species &lt;em&gt;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&lt;/em&gt; are decorated with proteins that can sense light. That ability, first noticed in 2002, quickly caught the attention of brain scientists. A light-sensing protein promised the power to control neurons — the brain’s nerve cells — by providing a way to turn them on and off, in exactly the right place and time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nerve cells genetically engineered to produce the algal proteins become light-controlled puppets. A flash of light could induce a quiet neuron to fire off signals or force an active neuron to fall silent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This molecule is the light sensor that we needed,” says vision neuroscientist Zhuo-Hua Pan, who had been searching for a way to control vision cells in mice’s retinas.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The method enabled by these loaner proteins &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/let-there-be-light-1&quot;&gt;is now called optogenetics&lt;/a&gt;, for its combination of light (opto) and genes. In less than two decades, optogenetics has led to big insights into how memories are stored, what creates perceptions and what goes wrong in the brain during depression and addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate our upcoming 100th anniversary, we’re launching a series that highlights some of the biggest advances in science over the last century. For more on the past, present and future of neuroscience, visit Century of Science: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/century/brains-future-neuroscience-memory-mind-network&quot;&gt;Our brains, our futures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-button aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;wp-block-button__link has-society-blue-background-color has-background&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/century/brains-future-neuroscience-memory-mind-network&quot;&gt;READ MORE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Using light to drive the activity of certain nerve cells, scientists have toyed with mouse hallucinations: Mice have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/manipulating-nerve-cells-makes-mice-see-something-not-there&quot;&gt;seen lines that aren’t there&lt;/a&gt; and have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/making-mouse-memories&quot;&gt;remembered a room they had never been inside&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists have used optogenetics to make mice &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mapping-aggression-circuits-brain&quot;&gt;fight, mate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/switch-eating&quot;&gt;eat&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/let-there-be-light-0&quot;&gt;given blind mice sight&lt;/a&gt;. In a big first, optogenetics recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/blindness-retinitis-pigmentosa-gene-therapy-vision-optogenetics&quot;&gt;restored aspects of a blind man’s vision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An early clue to the potential of optogenetics came around 1 a.m. on August 4, 2004. Neuroscientist Ed Boyden was in a lab at Stanford, checking on a dish of neurons that possessed a gene for one of the algal light sensors, called channelrhodopsin-2. Boyden was going to flash blue light on the cells and see if they fired signals. To his amazement, the very first cell he checked responded to the light with a burst of action, Boyden wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3155186/&quot;&gt;2011 account&lt;/a&gt;. The possibilities raised by that little spark of activity, described in a 2005 technical report by Boyden, Karl Deisseroth of Stanford University and colleagues, quickly became realities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Pan’s lab, light-responsive proteins restored vision in mice with damaged retinas, a finding that has now led to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-rewire-eye&quot;&gt;clinical trial in people&lt;/a&gt;. Optogenetics’ promise wasn’t a given in those early days, as scientists were first learning how to use these proteins in neurons. “At that time, no one anticipated that this optogenetic work would have such a huge impact,” Pan says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since those early discoveries, the algae’s light sensors have been adopted for use in numerous brain research arenas. Neuroscientist Talia Lerner of Northwestern University in Chicago, for example, uses optogenetics to study connections between cells in the mouse brain. The method allows her to tease apart the relationships between cells that produce and respond to dopamine, a chemical messenger involved in movement and reward. Those cellular links, illuminated by optogenetics, might help reveal details about motivation and learning. “My research really wouldn’t be possible in its current form without optogenetics,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics is also indispensable for Jeanne Paz of the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco. She and her colleagues have been hunting for the cells that can stop seizures from spreading across the brain. By giving her a way to control distinct groups of neurons, optogenetics is crucial to her search. “We really could not ask these questions with any other tool,” Paz says.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Her optogenetics-aided search led Paz to a brain structure called the thalamus, a way station for many neural networks in the brain. “I remember the goose bumps I experienced the first time I shined the light into the thalamus and it stopped the seizure,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, optogenetics research has taken place mostly in mice. But insights into more complex brains, including those of primates, may soon be found, says Yasmine El-Shamayleh of Columbia University. In 2009, Boyden and colleagues described optogenetics in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19409264/&quot;&gt;macaque&lt;/a&gt;. El-Shamayleh and others are pushing this line of research, hard. “We are definitely on the cusp” of revealing some fascinating principles of the primate brain, such as how the brain transforms signals from the eyes into perceptions, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics has evolved quickly. Scientists have engineered and optimized new light sensors and new ways of combining them with other techniques. An important reason for today’s widespread innovation, says Lerner, was the early spirit of sharing by optogenetics pioneers. At Stanford, Deisseroth would regularly run workshops to train other scientists on the technique. “In some ways, that’s as important as inventing it,” Lerner says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it’s worth taking a minute to appreciate the original sharers. No matter what happens next in this swiftly moving field, one thing is certain: Brain scientists will be forever in the algae’s debt.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02402-1&quot;&gt;Ali &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; set out to validate the KFRE in advanced CKD taking into account their cause of CKD (diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and other causes.  The KFRE performed well across all diseases and was found to have adequate discrimination and calibration.  What I found to be very interesting was that the KFRE provided better clinical utility for decision-making like pre-ESKD planning than basing it on GFR cutoffs alone.  Typically, we start planning for transplant evaluations, dialysis education, dialysis access placement, etc when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ajkd.org/article/S0272-6386(15)01019-7/pdf&quot;&gt;eGFR is &amp;lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2&lt;/a&gt; (in this study they used &amp;lt; 20 and &amp;lt; 15 mL/min/1.73m2).  with using the KFRE in Ali &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, they identified more patients who were likely to progress to ESKD and delay in others by using KFRE thresholds of &amp;gt; 40% for 2-year risk and &amp;gt; 50% for 5-year risk of ESKD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying patients who are progressing to ESKD is kept in planning for dialysis modality, access placement, and transplant referral.  If we can catch individuals early and start the process then there are fewer hospitalizations and poor outcomes.  Other studies have addressed using the KFRE in the necessity of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28835850/&quot;&gt;nephrology referrals&lt;/a&gt; and using it as a risk-based approach to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29375884&quot;&gt;guide CKD care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my review of the literature and Ali &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;.’s article, I definitely will start using the KFRE in my clinical assessment and planning for patients with advanced CKD.  Maybe it will help identify those patients who will benefit from early referral to transplant and access placement or at the least early education endeavors for those patients.  I can only see positives from using the KFRE as another clinical tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are other additional uses of the KFRE in your practice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you noticed an increase in scam texts recently?&lt;/strong&gt; I certainly have — and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210611-how-fraudsters-exploited-our-fears-during-the-pandemic&quot;&gt;so has David Robson&lt;/a&gt;, writing at &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;.  These scammers often make it seem like we are facing some immediate threat like legal trouble or loss of money, capitalising on the fact that in this kind of situation we are less likely to think and act rationally. And the pandemic has provided just the right conditions for these scams to flourish, Robson writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42600&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As we mentioned &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/04/magic-tricks-and-media-literacy-the-weeks-best-psychology-links/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a couple of weeks ago&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, the idea that groups succumb to “groupthink” is hotly contested.&lt;/strong&gt; This week at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/how-humans-think-when-they-think-group/&quot;&gt;Annie Murphy Paul takes a look at the more positive side of group cognition&lt;/a&gt;, drawing on a fascinating case study in which sailors on board an out-of-control aircraft carrier worked together to narrowly avert disaster. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Australian study has found that primary-aged kids perform better when their schools are surrounded by more green spaces. &lt;/strong&gt;It’s not simply the case that these schools are attended by children from wealthier families, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/green-space-around-primary-schools-may-improve-students-academic-performance-161673&quot;&gt;write the researchers Alison Carver and Amanda J Wheeler&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, because the research compared schools with similar socioeconomic backgrounds. Instead, the pair suggests that the effect could be related to reduced pollution near schools with more greenery, or de-stressing effects of the green spaces themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paying too much attention to something can distort our perceptions of the world,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyche.co/ideas/sometimes-paying-attention-means-we-see-the-world-less-clearly&quot;&gt;argues Henry Taylor&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Psyche&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could brands one day insert advertisements into your dreams?&lt;/strong&gt; That’s the fear of a group of dream researchers, who have released an open letter calling for “dream manipulation” to be regulated, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/06/are-advertisers-coming-your-dreams&quot;&gt;reports Sofia Moutinho&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have found that when exposed to the common antidepressant citalopram, crayfish become bolder, emerging out of their shelters more readily to look for food. &lt;/strong&gt;The study was conducted in the lab, but used levels of antidepressants which have previously been found in streams, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/antidepressant-pollution-in-water-may-make-crayfish-bolder&quot;&gt;reports Douglas Main&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt;. This suggests that in the wild, antidepressant drugs which make their way into the environment via wastewater could affect the animals’ behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHILADELPHIA&lt;/strong&gt; — In a makeshift tent behind a soccer goal and close enough to a taco stand that the smell of grilling barbacoa and carnitas drifts over, Melissa Pluguez cheerfully asks a man, in Spanish, if he’s right- or left-handed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The man, wearing jeans and a red T-shirt with white letters that spell Abercrombie, answers right, and confesses he’s a bit afraid of needles. Even so, he’s been eager to get a COVID-19 vaccine, Pluguez translates, but hasn’t felt comfortable going to vaccination sites around Philadelphia. But when he heard about this vaccination event — staffed by local, Spanish-speaking medical professionals and held at his church congregation’s regular Sunday gathering — he felt ready.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pluguez is a nurse practitioner for critical care at Cooper University Health Care in Camden, N.J., and co-medical director of Unidos Contra COVID, the small group that organized this vaccine outreach event. She tells the man that the fear is worse than the needle, and he nods and looks away as she injects the Pfizer vaccine into his left arm. Afterward, he smiles, and the two bump elbows before the man leaves to pick up his vaccination card. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s no free beer in sight, nor is anyone getting complimentary tickets to Phillies baseball games. Instead, roughly 300 people are clustered around soccer fields that border the church parking lot. The main event is a tournament, where professional-looking players in uniform square off as spectators cheer. On adjacent fields, children kick balls around or chase each other through the lines of people waiting to buy tacos or mango slices stuffed into plastic cups. Couples dance to upbeat music emanating from loudspeakers set up near Unidos Contra COVID’s tent. Inside, behind dark mesh netting partitions set up for privacy amid all that action, vaccines are being delivered into arm after arm.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the end, this sort of targeted approach may be a more impactful way than the flashier, broader efforts, like beer giveaways and large cash prizes, to reach the roughly &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home&quot;&gt;35 percent of adults&lt;/a&gt; in the United States who haven’t yet gotten at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. Such a hyperlocal focus, experts say, can address the idiosyncratic and complex array of reasons that people aren’t getting vaccinated, especially in often overlooked and underserved communities that have experienced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-surge-4th-wave-us-young-cases-vaccination&quot;&gt;higher rates of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; and relatively low numbers of vaccinations (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/3/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like in other parts of the country, Hispanic communities in Philadelphia have been especially impacted by COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phila.gov/programs/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/data/testing/#/&quot;&gt;hospitalization rates&lt;/a&gt; for Hispanic people in the city who are 35 and older have been higher than for any other group, as have death rates for those 75 and older. And vaccinations have lagged; only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phila.gov/programs/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/data/vaccine/&quot;&gt;37 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the Hispanic population has received one dose, compared with 51 percent of white residents as of June 14.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A group of local doctors and nursed formed Unidos Contra COVID, which means United Against COVID, earlier this year to address these disparities. The Hispanic population in Philadelphia is diverse, and “our experiences and makeup is hardly monolithic,” says José Torradas, an emergency room physician and co-medical director of Unidos Contra COVID, who left his job earlier this year to focus on outreach full-time. People in this community aren’t getting the vaccine “for different reasons in different groups.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Figuring out those reasons has become crucial to Unidos Contra COVID’s mission. The group has found that for Central American and Mexican communities in parts of Philadelphia, access has been the biggest problem. Meanwhile, in the predominantly Puerto Rican and Dominican communities of northern Philadelphia, Torradas says, vaccine skepticism stems from misinformation and a general distrust of the government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;José Torradas rubs alcohol on a masked woman's arm&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100621&quot; height=&quot;544&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061721_jl_vaccineoutreach_inline1_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100621&quot;&gt;José Torradas, a physician and co-medical director of Unidos Contra COVID, rubs alcohol on a woman’s arm before giving her a COVID-19 vaccine shot at a local community gathering on June 13 in the Philadelphia area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100621&quot;&gt;Paula Lopez&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Barriers to access&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the church event, Unidos Contra COVID came to bring vaccines to people who won’t travel to unfamiliar places to get them, because of language barriers or for fear of deportation. Many of the people gathered around the soccer fields are undocumented, Torradas says, though his group never asks about immigration status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These Sunday gatherings represent the few hours each week that these communities come together, he says, often after church. “It’s a sanctuary, a place they feel safe.” For that reason, organizers asked that the church not be named.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rest of the week, it’s either work or home for many undocumented people. “Anything outside of that routine represents a risk,” Torradas says. Even though local pharmacies may be close, or federal distribution sites accessible by bus, fears of interacting with government services or law enforcement keep many from getting vaccinated, he says. By law, undocumented immigrants are eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s lots of desire [here] for the vaccine,” Torradas says. “They just don’t want to get deported.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Kaiser Family Foundation poll in May found that Hispanics who have yet to receive a COVID-19 vaccine are about twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites or Blacks to say &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-access-information-experiences-hispanic-adults/&quot;&gt;they’d like to get vaccinated as soon as possible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shot status&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hispanic adults expressed a desire to get the COVID-19 vaccine “as soon as possible” at much higher rates than Black or white adults, according to a telephone survey of 2,097 adults conducted April 15 to April 29 by the Kaiser Family Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To best serve these communities, Unidos Contra COVID teams up with trusted figures in the area, like José Hernández. He’s a church leader who can identify times and places where the group could have the most impact, and who can spread the word among the community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking loudly to be heard over the music, Hernández says that he had been trying to connect members of the congregation with vaccines since they first became available. But most people weren’t willing to travel far to get the shots, even though they are free. And simply going to their doctor often isn’t an option, since Hispanic Americans also have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-271.pdf&quot;&gt;highest rates of uninsurance&lt;/a&gt; of any racial or ethnic group according to the U.S. Census Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Being able to get the vaccines at a regular community event, and from people who speak Spanish, “has just been incredible,” Hernández says. Besides two large events that Unidos Contra COVID has held at his church, Torradas and Pluguez have both come out to give shots to smaller groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve never had an experience like this … where doctors come to us,” Hernández says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fear of deportation and language issues aren’t the only barriers to vaccination in some of these communities. There’s also gun violence to worry about. In 2020, there were over &lt;a href=&quot;https://controller.phila.gov/philadelphia-audits/mapping-gun-violence/#/2020&quot;&gt;2,200 shootings in Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, among the highest number for any U.S. city. Walking or taking the bus even just a kilometer or two to a vaccine distribution site in some neighborhoods “might mean crossing two or three gang turfs,” Torradas says. Some people have told him they don’t feel comfortable leaving their own block.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To reach such communities, Torradas and his colleagues have set up shop in places like schools and shopping malls, operating on weekends and evenings, in addition to church events. Many of the people who come “are day laborers who leave [home] at 5 a.m. and don’t get back till late,” Pluguez says. And many “are not hesitant. They are just not able to access the resources.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Addressing vaccine hesitancy&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, there are people in these communities who are skeptical of vaccines, Pluguez says. Reasons range from general distrust of government, to fears that stem from misinformation, such as that the vaccine causes sterility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the concern “is truly borne of crimes that have been committed [against] both Black and Hispanic communities,” Pluguez says, citing official programs that resulted in up to a third of &lt;a href=&quot;https://nwhn.org/sterilization-abuse-the-policies-behind-the-practice/&quot;&gt;Puerto Rican women being sterilized&lt;/a&gt; from the 1930s to 1970s, often without informed consent. “So hearing now that this vaccine might make them sterile? That runs deep, it runs very deep.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another common, false rumor is that the vaccines contain microchips with location trackers. Such rumors, which spread quickly on social media, can easily take hold in communities with undocumented immigrants. “They don’t want to have to fear every day that something they just put in their bodies is going to make them prone to being deported,” Pluguez says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address that mistrust, Unidos Contra COVID tries to identify trusted members of the community who could act as effective messengers. People are more likely to listen “to a face they recognize, who has been around longer than the vaccine,” Torradas says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Individuals personally impacted by COVID, especially younger people, are especially effective. “Bring me the most fit person in this congregation who almost died of COVID and have him and the medical professionals stand in front of everybody, tell their story and answer their questions. That’s the formula for hyperlocal buy in,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unidos Contra COVID also canvasses nearby streets during their vaccination events, trying to meet people where they are. “The moment I start speaking Spanish, you can absolutely see their eyes light up, and they start engaging in a way that’s very different,” Pluguez says. From that kernel of trust, she listens to people’s concerns about vaccination “without putting blame on them,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When misinformation comes up, she addresses it practically. “[If people ask] ‘What if there’s a microchip?’ I say, ‘Come look at the vaccine for yourself. Look at the needle. Look at the vial. You can see that there is nothing in it,’” Pluguez says. Often she talks about her experience as an emergency room nurse during the worst of the pandemic. “I share with them how many hands I’ve held of the sick and dying, alone,” she says, and how the vaccine can prevent that from happening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a previous vaccine outreach event in south Philadelphia, Pluguez once spent 45 minutes talking with one man she encountered walking down the street with his pregnant wife and three young boys. “He’d heard a lot of the rumors,” she says, about microchips and sterility. Pluguez addressed those concerns in Spanish, while playing with his kids to keep them entertained so she and the man could talk more. Twice during their conversation, the man left, saying he’d think more about it. “He made it a block before coming back with more questions,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pluguez pulled up a chair for him, and they continued talking. As the conversation went on, she noticed a shift in his demeanor. “He started looking directly at me and making jokes,” she says. “That’s when I got the feeling that he finally trusts me.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the man expressed worry about missing work if he got sick from the vaccine, Pluguez remembers. So she asked him, “What if you get sick with COVID? What is your wife going to do if you’re laid up in the hospital? Who is going to pay the bills?” Ultimately, that message got through. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Then he said, ‘As long as you stand by my side, I’ll do it.’ And I said, ‘I’ll be here with you every step of the way,’” she says. Pluguez stayed with him through vaccine registration, the shot and the 15-minute waiting period afterward. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was really proud of him … I had such joy in my heart,” Pluguez says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re no longer looking at the people who were desperate to get vaccinated,” she says. “Now every single person who shows up is a victory, is one step further into making COVID an issue of the past.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Amid the food, music and soccer at that Sunday vaccination event, 151 people got their first or second vaccine dose. Since Unidos Contra COVID began their events in early May, the group has vaccinated about 850 people, and hopes to scale up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the afternoon event, Pluguez pulled out thick UPS package. “Our official 501(c)(3) documents,” she says. “I promised José I wouldn’t open them until we could do it together.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They expect to get approval from the Internal Revenue Service in a few weeks. Becoming an official nonprofit will help the group more easily apply directly for grant money, allowing it to purchase more freezers for vaccine storage and hire more full-time staff. Currently, about 50 people contribute to the effort as volunteers, with Pluguez and Torradas devoting the most time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two pose for a picture with the documents, celebrating the milestone. “I may shed a tear, I’m so excited,” she says. Then, Pluguez gathers her things to leave for the hospital. Before she goes, someone from the taco stand brings her a Styrofoam box filled with dinner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve worked the past six nights; tonight is my last shift,” she says. “I get off at 7 a.m., then I can sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/06/17/adding-interactive-citation-maps-to-arxiv/"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">
 &lt;p&gt;We’re pleased to announce a new arXivLabs collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.litmaps.co/&quot;&gt;Litmaps&lt;/a&gt;. The new &lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXivLabs&lt;/a&gt; feature allows arXiv users to quickly generate a citation map of the top connected articles, and then explore the citation network using the Litmaps research platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A citation network is a visualization of the literature cited by a research paper. The network shows how papers are related to each other in terms of concepts, subject areas, and history — and they’re valuable for &lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hgKElc&quot;&gt;analyzing the development of research areas, making decisions on research directions, and assessing the impacts of research, researchers, institutes, countries, and individual papers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers can now view a Litmap citation network for a specific paper, directly from the arXiv abstract page by clicking on the “Bibliographic Tools” tab at the bottom of an abstract page and activating “Litmaps.” Using this tool, arXiv readers can now easily jump from articles they are interested in and use Litmaps’ custom visualization and automated search tools to find other critical articles they may have missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_1038&quot; style=&quot;width: 466px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot of litmaps tool on arXiv abstract page&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-1038&quot; height=&quot;424&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/06/Litmaps-Screenshot.png&quot; width=&quot;466&quot; /&gt;From an arXiv abstract page, readers can activate the Litmaps tool to view citation networks&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An arXivLabs Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to be able to offer arXiv readers new visual ways to explore scientific literature. Litmaps will enrich the arXiv reading experience and help readers find what they need,” said Eleonora Presani, executive director of arXiv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tool supports arXiv’s mission to provide an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant, emerging science and establish their contribution to advancing research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are arXiv users ourselves at Litmaps, so it’s great to be able to collaborate and integrate with arXiv, which is a key resource for the research community,” said Axton Pitt, cofounder of Litmaps. The company aims to make the process of literature discovery easy and fun, and welcomes feedback via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LitmapsApp&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:team@litmaps.co&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this blog post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.litmaps.co/blog/posts/adding-interactive-citation-maps-to-arxiv&quot;&gt;appears here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Quantum mechanics usually applies to very small objects: atoms, electrons and the like. But physicists have now brought the equivalent of a 10-kilogram object to the edge of the quantum realm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists with the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, reduced vibrations in a combination of the facility’s mirrors to &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abh2634&quot;&gt;nearly the lowest level allowed&lt;/a&gt; by quantum mechanics, they report in the June 18 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers quelled differences between the jiggling of LIGO’s four 40-kilogram mirrors, putting them in near-perfect sync. When the mirrors are combined in this way, they behave effectively like a single, 10-kilogram object.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LIGO is designed to measure gravitational waves, using laser light that bounces between sets of mirrors &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-explained&quot;&gt;in the detector’s two long arms&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/11/16&lt;/em&gt;). But physicist Vivishek Sudhir of MIT and colleagues instead used the laser light to monitor the mirrors’ movements to extreme precision and apply electric fields to resist the motion. “It’s almost like a noise-canceling headphone,” says Sudhir. But instead of measuring nearby sounds and canceling out that noise, the technique cancels out motion.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The researchers reduced the mirrors’ relative motions to about 10.8 phonons, or quantum units of vibration, close to the zero-phonon quantum limit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s purpose is not to better understand gravitational waves, but to get closer to revealing secrets of quantum mechanics. Scientists are still trying to understand why large objects don’t typically follow the laws of quantum mechanics. Such objects lose their quantum properties, or decohere. Studying quantum states of more massive objects could help scientists pin down how decoherence happens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have observed much smaller objects in quantum states. In 2020, physicist Markus Aspelmeyer of the University of Vienna and colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-cooled-nanoparticle-quantum-limit-ground-state&quot;&gt;brought vibrations of a nanoparticle to the quantum limit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/30/20&lt;/em&gt;). LIGO’s mirrors are “a fantastic system to study decoherence effects on super-massive objects in the quantum regime,” says Aspelmeyer.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;When it comes to global warming and sea level rise, scientists have made some dire predictions. One of the most calamitous involves the widespread collapse of ice cliffs along the edges of Greenland and Antarctica, which could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-sheets-collapse-sea-level-rise-climate-change&quot;&gt;raise sea level as much as 4 meters by 2200&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/6/19&lt;/em&gt;). Now, new simulations suggest that massive glaciers flowing into the sea &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abf6271&quot;&gt;may not be as vulnerable&lt;/a&gt; to such collapses as once believed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One hypothesis that projected calamitous sea level rise is called the marine ice cliff instability. It suggests that sea-facing bluffs of ice more than 100 meters tall will fail and then slough off to expose fresh ice. Those new cliffs will in turn disintegrate, fall into the sea and float away, setting off a relatively rapid retreat of the glacier that boosts sea level rise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although discussed for years, the phenomenon hasn’t yet been seen in today’s glaciers, says Jeremy Bassis, a glaciologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “But that may not be surprising, due to the relatively short record of observations in the field and by satellites,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of the dearth of field data, Bassis and colleagues decided to use computer simulations to explore ice-cliff behavior. Unlike previous models, the researchers’ simulations considered how ice flows under pressure as well as how it fractures when highly stressed. This blended model is “a pioneering composite,” says Nicholas Golledge, a glaciologist at the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, who wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;First, the researchers simulated the collapse of a 135-meter-tall ice cliff on dry land. Over a virtual period of weeks, the face of the cliff shattered and then slumped down to the base, where the icy rubble helped buttress the cliff against further collapse. Researchers have often seen this result in the field, Bassis says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, the team simulated a 400-meter-tall glacier flowing into water that was 290 meters deep. These dimensions are typical of some of the massive glaciers in Greenland flowing into deep fjords, Bassis says. When the cybercliff collapsed, ice that fell into the water at the cliff’s base floated away, leading to repeated failures and rapid, runaway collapse of the glacier. But adding even a small amount of back pressure at the base of the cliff — as would happen if icebergs got stuck and couldn’t waft away, or if they froze in place — prevented a runaway collapse, Bassis and his team reports in the June 18 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. “We didn’t expect this to be the case,” Bassis says. “But if small bergs got stuck in the shallows ahead of the ice cliff, it was enough to buttress the [cliff] face,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simulations of an 800-meter-tall glacier flowing into 690 meters of water, comparable to the dimensions of the Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers in Antarctica, yielded similar results. The researchers also found that in relatively warm ambient temperatures, ice flow upstream of the cliff thins the glacier and reduces the height of the cliff, thus reducing the likelihood of runaway collapses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team’s simulations “capture what I think of as realistic behavior,” says Golledge, who coauthored &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abj3266&quot;&gt;a commentary on the study&lt;/a&gt; in the same issue of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. Future fieldwork may help validate the group’s results. If the simulations hold, Golledge says, the less dire results may mean slower sea level rise in the short term than otherwise predicted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bassis and his colleagues’ analysis “is an important piece of work,” says Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved in the study. The results, he says, “provide a balance between the possibilities for extreme runaway collapse and some that are more realistic.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gambling is big business in the UK. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/health-survey-for-england/2018/health-survey-for-england-2018-supplementary-analysis-on-gambling&quot;&gt;NHS Digital&lt;/a&gt;, 57% of men and 54% of women reported gambling in 2018, while the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/about-us/statistics-and-research&quot;&gt;Gambling Commission&lt;/a&gt; suggests that online gambling grew by 8.1% from 2019 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, gambling changed quite significantly: while consumers could still buy scratchcards and lottery tickets in supermarkets and off licenses, betting shops were closed and sports matches cancelled, leading many activities to move entirely online. And according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-021-10029-y&quot;&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; from researchers at the University of Bristol, although the British public gambled less overall during lockdown, among regular gamblers, rates of &lt;em&gt;online&lt;/em&gt; gambling increased substantially. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42587&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data came from participants in a longitudinal study that has been taking place since the 1990s, who were sent extra questionnaires during the 2020 lockdown. Questions on gambling focused on activity in the previous month, with participants asked whether, and how often, they had engaged in the National Lottery, scratchcards, online gambling or betting, and other forms of gambling. The questionnaires also focused on participants’ mental health and financial security and employment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, gambling frequency reduced during lockdown — unsurprising, considering that many in-person opportunities to gamble were off-limits. This was true for both regular gamblers (those who gambled once a week or more before the pandemic) and occasional gamblers (who gambled less than weekly). However, the proportion of people taking part in online gambling activities like poker, bingo, and casino games increased sixfold among regular gamblers, and doubled among occasional gamblers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neither depression nor anxiety were linked with frequency of gambling. However, alcohol use was: people who drank heavily — more than six units more than once a week — were more likely to gamble weekly compared to not gambling at all. Finances were also relevant — people who were struggling financially even before COVID-19 hit were more likely to engage in any kind of gambling during lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not a huge surprise that online gambling increased during the pandemic: there were fewer opportunities for gambling outside of the home, and as a recreational activity, gambling may have relieved the boredom of lockdown. But the team worry that online gambling could represent a bigger threat than its offline counterpart to some groups, with young people in particular susceptible to being “sucked in” to addictive online gambling. The rise of eSports and the increasingly popular combination of gaming and gambling could be a particular issue here — overall, the Gambling Commission &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news-action-and-statistics/Statistics-and-research/Covid-19-research/Covid-19-updated-August-2020/Gambling-business-data-on-gambling-during-Covid-19-updated-August-2020.aspx&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; the biggest increase during lockdown was in bets on eSports. Increased levels of home working, too, could also lead more people, alone at home, to start gambling.                     &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The strong link between binge drinking and gambling was also of concern, lead author Alan Emond &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2021/may/online-gambling.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, as they are “both addictive behaviours which can have serious health and social consequences.” Many of those who reported gambling had also faced financial difficulties before COVID-19, another concerning finding of the study — gambling to get out of difficult financial situations could simply compound the issue, drawing people into even more debt. The team also suggests that the study may have underestimated the extent of gambling, as 70% of participants were women and men were more likely to be regular gamblers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all gambling behaviour will be problematic: many people happily buy the odd scratchcard or enter the Lottery every week without developing a serious problem. However, the links with both alcohol use and financial insecurity point to the darker side of gambling — and may suggest that digital interventions or restrictions on gambling sites could be needed to reach people who are struggling with gambling at home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are concerned about your gambling, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamcare.org.uk/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;GamCare&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; offers free information, support and counselling for problem gamblers in the UK. It runs the National Gambling Helpline (0808 8020 133) and offers face-to-face counselling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-021-10029-y&quot;&gt;Gambling by Young Adults in the UK During COVID-19 Lockdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780197546123&quot;&gt;Tsunami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;James Goff and Walter Dudley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oxford Univ., $34.95&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On March 27, 1964, Ted Pederson was helping load oil onto a tanker in Seward, Alaska, when a magnitude 9.2 quake struck. Within seconds, the waterfront began sliding into the bay. As Pederson ran up the dock toward shore, a tsunami lifted the tanker and rafts of debris onto the dock, knocking him unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pederson survived, but more than 100 others in Alaska did not. His story is just one of more than 400 harrowing eyewitness accounts that bring such disasters to life in &lt;em&gt;Tsunami.&lt;/em&gt; Written by geologist James Goff and oceanographer Walter Dudley, the book also weaves in accounts from researchers examining the geologic record to shed light on prehistoric tsunamis.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Chapter by chapter, Goff and Dudley offer readers a primer on tsunamis: Most are caused by undersea earthquakes, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/killer-waves&quot;&gt;some are triggered by landslides&lt;/a&gt;, the sudden collapse of volcanic islands or meteorites hitting the ocean (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/6/04, p. 152&lt;/em&gt;). Readers may be surprised to learn that tsunamis need not occur on the coast: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tsunami-lake-tahoe&quot;&gt;Lake Tahoe&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/10/00, p. 378&lt;/em&gt;) and New Zealand’s Lake Tarawera are just two of many inland locales mentioned that have experienced freshwater tsunamis.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Copiously illustrated and peppered with maps, the book takes readers on a world-spanning tour of ancient and recent tsunamis, from a deep-ocean impact off the coast of South America about 2.5 million years ago to numerous tsunamis of the 21st century. The authors’ somber treatment of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tsunami-disaster-scientists-model-big-quake-and-its-consequences&quot;&gt;the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004&lt;/a&gt; stands out (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/8/05, p. 19&lt;/em&gt;). Triggered by a magnitude 9.1 earthquake, the megawave killed more than 130,000 people in Indonesia alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors — Goff is a professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney and Dudley is a researcher at the University of Hawaii at Hilo — help readers understand tsunamis’ power via descriptions of the damage they’ve wrought. For instance, the account of a huge wave in Alaska that scoured mature trees from steep slopes along fjords up to a height of 524 meters — about 100 meters taller than the Empire State Building — may leave readers stunned. But it’s the heart-thumping stories of survivors who ran to high ground, clambered up tall trees or clung to debris after washing out to sea that linger with the reader. They remind us of the human cost of living on the shore when great waves strike.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-dust-cold-spell-why-giant-star-dimmed"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3100584</id>
		<updated>2021-06-16T15:06:01+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Astronomers around the world were startled in late 2019 when Betelgeuse, one of the brightest stars in the sky, grew dark for several months. Rumors swirled that the star was about to go supernova. It didn’t. But debate over what &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; going on exploded. Now, newly released images taken before and during the “Great Dimming” suggest what happened: The star’s surface cooled and triggered a cloud of dust that temporarily blocked its light.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is the best interpretation we can get with the data that we have … without flying our spaceship to Betelgeuse and seeing what’s going on there,” says astrophysicist Emily Cannon of KU Leuven in Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cannon and colleagues used the SPHERE instrument on the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile to take snapshots of Betelgeuse for more than a year. Serendipitously, the team had captured an image of the star in January 2019, months before the dimming began, and could compare that image with others taken in December 2019 and January and March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03546-8&quot;&gt;dimming wasn’t spread uniformly&lt;/a&gt; across Betelgeuse’s surface, the team reports June 16 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. A dark splotch was concentrated over the star’s southern hemisphere. The researchers then ran computer simulations of the star, which included incorporating how dynamic gas bubbles constantly churn beneath its surface, to figure out the likeliest explanation for the way that the dimming played out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier observations of the star had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-star-dim-supernova-death-what-happened&quot;&gt;split astronomers into two camps&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/29/20&lt;/em&gt;). One group thought that a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-star-dust-supernova-explosion&quot;&gt;cloud of dust&lt;/a&gt; had blocked Betelgeuse’s light (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/12/20&lt;/em&gt;). Another thought that there wasn’t enough evidence of dust, and the dimming was due to temporary cooling at Betelgeuse’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astrophysicist Miguel Montargès says that now that he’s seen his team’s data, he’s in both camps. “The most natural conclusion is that both events happened,” says Montargès, of the Paris Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team’s hypothesis is that in late 2019, a temporary cold patch formed in Betelgeuse’s southern hemisphere due to the normal churning of surface plasma, and that cooling caused the star’s light to dim. The cold patch then allowed gas that had been released from the star’s surface to cool enough to form dust particles, which further blocked the star’s light.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“You start getting a runaway effect,” which makes it easier for more dust to form, says astrophysicist Emily Levesque of the University of Washington in Seattle, who was not involved in the research but wrote a commentary in the same issue of &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. As the dust spread out, the starlight shone through again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some astronomers are still unconvinced that dust is part of the answer. The images plus simulations don’t prove dust was there, says astrophysicist Thavisha Dharmawardena of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. “This discussion will continue till we obtain direct evidence for dust,” says Dharmawardena, who has looked for — and failed to find — signs of dust during the Great Dimming.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Montargès thinks the dust was just hard to see using other techniques. “When people say they are not seeing new dust, I think they are wrong,” he says. “It’s that their data does not allow them to see it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both researchers agree that the Atacama Large Millimeter Array in Chile could break the stalemate. That telescope was out of commission last summer due to the COVID-19 pandemic, when its observations would have been most useful. More observations are scheduled for this summer, and if dust is still there, ALMA should see it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, “if we cannot identify it, it’s not because it’s not there,” Montargès says. “It’s because we are too late.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Betelgeuse observations may help astronomers recognize similar dimming events in other stars, Levesque says. Betelgeuse is Earth’s closest red supergiant star, a late phase of the stellar life cycle that comes before a supernova explosion. While dust does not predict an explosion, it can be part of how these stars lose mass before they die.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So when will Betelgeuse go out with a bang? “Not today,” Montargès says. “Every day, we are closer to the explosion, that’s for sure. I think it’s not tomorrow, or even in our lifetime, for Betelgeuse.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Bente Riegler will talk about a paper &quot;Toward a New Theory of Motor Synergies&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driven by recent empirical studies, we offer a new understanding of
the degrees of freedom problem, and propose a refined concept of
synergy as a neural organization that ensures a one-to-many mapping of
variables providing for both stability of important performance
variables and flexibility of motor patterns to deal with possible
perturbations and/or secondary tasks. Empirical evidence is reviewed,
including a discussion of the operationalization of
stability/flexibility through the method of the uncontrolled manifold.
We show how this concept establishes links between the various
accounts for how movement is organized in redundant effector systems.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;What do you think was riskier during the pre-vaccine days of the pandemic: having your lonely parents over for dinner or going to a beach filled with dozens of strangers? Or how about going to the doctor for a prescription refill versus playing baseball at a nearby park?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to catching COVID-19, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-case-clusters-lessons-warnings-reopening&quot;&gt;outdoor activities, in general, are safer than indoor activities&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;8/15/20&lt;/em&gt;). But if you chose the beach or baseball as riskier, you are not alone. Two new studies show that people consider activities that they think are immoral or unreasonable as riskier — even when they’re not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our moral judgments change our factual judgments about the world,” says philosopher of science Cailin O’Connor of the University of California, Irvine&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Accounting for moral and other biases in public health messaging is vital to combatting the spread of infectious disease, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It’s well-established that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-how-fear-anger-change-risk-perception&quot;&gt;people rely on emotions and beliefs to make decisions&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/14/20&lt;/em&gt;). These mental shortcuts, or heuristics, tend to take precedence during periods of uncertainty, as the right decision can be far from clear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;O’Connor became interested in studying the link between bias and risk perception after pictures of Floridians flocking to the beach caused an outcry in spring of 2020. “Why was the beach such a target of public judgment?” O’Connor wondered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She and colleagues devised hypothetical scenarios in which people were exposed to the same risk of infection with the coronavirus but had various reasons for violating social distancing guidelines. For instance, a character named Joe gets trapped in an elevator with five neighbors for 25 minutes. In one scenario, Joe is a cocaine user going out to pay his dealer, while in another he is going to help an elderly neighbor fix her broken air conditioner on a hot day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an online survey, 841 respondents evaluated how moral Person X’s action was on a scale from one to seven and also how risky that person’s action was on a scale from one to 10. Increasing moral judgment scores by two points (to become more immoral) &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/59s2g&quot;&gt;increased people’s perception of risk&lt;/a&gt; by almost a tenth of a point, the researchers report in a study posted May 10 at PsyArXiv.org, a preprint server. The study has not yet been reviewed by other scientists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found a similar link when social distancing violations were seen as intentional rather than accidental. That belief could filter into this current moment, O’Connor says. It might be that people think that if another person intentionally didn’t get vaccinated, he or she is at higher risk than if a person couldn’t get vaccinated, she says. That false belief bodes poorly for those still waiting for a vaccine, such as little kids. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These effects are small but potentially consequential, says study coauthor Daniel Relihan, a psychologist at UC Irvine. For instance, such biases can appear in social media feeds, such as when social distance violations are presented as morally right and therefore relatively safe. Repeat exposure to such narratives can cloud people’s risk judgements over time, Relihan says.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a similar study, published December 2020 at PsyArXiv.org, behavioral scientist Shane Timmons and colleagues evaluated the link between the perceived reasonableness of an action and people’s perception of COVID-19 risk. In that study, 800 online participants rated how reasonable/risky it was for Person X in a short vignette to violate social distancing guidelines when he or she had a pressing need, such as a doctor’s appointment or debilitating loneliness. A 50-point sliding scale ran from “not at all risky/reasonable” to “extremely risky/completely unreasonable.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers found when a given medical or mental health risk went from low to high — such as from a minor health complaint that could be addressed online to a potentially serious complaint requiring an in-person consultation — &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/qeb9s/&quot;&gt;the perceived risk of infection decreased four points&lt;/a&gt;, even though the actual risk of getting COVID-19 hadn’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That four-point drop, says Timmons, of the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin, “equates to the change in risk people associate with going to a gathering of 15 people compared to a gathering of five or six people.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People might be relying on their feelings to guide their actions — known as the “affect heuristic,” both teams of researchers suggest. For instance, a person who loves skiing will perceive the sport as less risky than a person who hates the sport, O’Connor says. Or perhaps, people are calling upon “just world” beliefs, the idea that good things happen to good people and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Behavioral scientists largely agree that this research should inform public health. But sorting out how to incorporate this knowledge into a public health campaign requires further research, says psychologist Toby Wise of Caltech.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Informing a devout individual that going to a crowded place of worship during a pandemic is as risky as going to a crowded bar, for example, could backfire if people see government authorities as lacking sensitivity, Wise says. “We don’t necessarily know that we can modify these [behaviors] just through public health messaging.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A new chemical analysis has revealed an ugly truth about beauty products: Many may contain highly persistent, potentially harmful “forever chemicals” called PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PFAS, short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, include thousands of chemicals that are so sturdy they can linger in the body for years and the environment for centuries. The health effects of only a few PFAS are well known, but those compounds have been linked to high cholesterol, thyroid diseases and other problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is no known good PFAS,” says chemist and physicist Graham Peaslee of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first large screening of cosmetics for PFAS in the United States and Canada, Peaslee and colleagues found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.1c00240&quot;&gt;52 percent of over 200 tested products&lt;/a&gt; had high fluorine concentrations, suggesting the presence of PFAS, the researchers report online June 15 in &lt;em&gt;Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology Letters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cosmetic chemicals&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among over 200 tested beauty products, about half contained high levels of fluorine — a marker for potentially harmful PFAS compounds. Waterproof mascaras, liquid lipsticks and foundations were especially likely to contain lots of fluorine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Makeup items with high levels of fluorine&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-table&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Makeup type&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of products tested&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Percentage with high fluorine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;All lip products (lipsticks, glosses, etc.)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;60&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;55%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;      Liquid lipstick&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;42&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;62%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Foundations (liquids, creams)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;43&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;63%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Concealers&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;36%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Other face products (blush, bronzers, etc.)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;40%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;All mascara&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;32&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;47%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;      Waterproof mascara&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;82%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Other eye products (shadows, liners, etc.)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;43&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;58%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;All cosmetics tested&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;231&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;52%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The potential health risks of PFAS in makeup are not yet clear, Peaslee says. But besides people ingesting or absorbing PFAS when wearing makeup, cosmetics washed down the drain could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/engineering-clean-drinking-water-treatment-pollution&quot;&gt;get into drinking water&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/25/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peaslee’s team measured the amount of fluorine, a key component of PFAS, in 231 cosmetics. Sixty-three percent of foundations, 55 percent of lip products and 82 percent of waterproof mascara contained high levels of fluorine — at least 0.384 micrograms of fluorine per square centimeter of product spread on a piece of paper. Long-lasting or waterproof products were especially likely to contain lots of fluorine. That makes sense, since PFAS are water-resistant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine products further tested for specific PFAS all contained at least four of these chemicals, but only one product listed PFAS among its ingredients. In addition to posing their own potential health risks, these compounds can break down in the body into other PFAS, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pfas-chemicals-biodegradable-food-containers-compost&quot;&gt;such as perfluorooctanoic acid&lt;/a&gt;, which has been linked to cancers and low birth weights (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/4/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A common lab plant that’s been poked and put under microscopes for decades may seem unlikely to keep secrets. But in widely studied &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana, &lt;/em&gt;scientists have identified the “cantil” — a newly reported plant organ named for its cantilever-like way of branching off of the main stem. The structure &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article-lookup/DOI/10.1242/dev.195545&quot;&gt;appears in only some &lt;em&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and only under certain conditions, researchers report online June 15 in &lt;em&gt;Development&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you told me of a new organ in a weird plant in Amazonia, I wouldn’t be surprised at all,” says François Parcy, a plant biologist at CNRS in Paris, who was not involved in the study. “What struck me is this happened in &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/em&gt;. This is something that’s really surprising.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Molecular biologist Timothy Gookin first suspected contamination or a mutation when he noticed some &lt;em&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/em&gt; with odd stalks jutting out from the stem, like half-finished bridges. It took 12 years of experiments at Penn State to show that the rare stalks are a new type of plant part and to explain their trigger: delayed flowering. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like many other plants, short days prompt &lt;em&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/em&gt;, which is in the same family as cabbage and mustard greens, to shore up resources; long days tell it to churn out flowers. Cantils form when that transition from stockpiling to blooming is postponed, as the plant keeps growing while waiting for the flowering signal, the researchers found. The cantil is “just growing kind of like, ‘Hey, where’s the summer? OK, I’m waiting for my break. Where’s it coming?’” Gookin says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image of Arabidopsis thaliana plant with cantilever-like organ&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100559&quot; height=&quot;515&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061421_jc_new-plant_inline_680_rev.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100559&quot;&gt;A newly described cantilever-like organ (arrow) depends on both genetics and circumstance to appear. It develops only in some &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/em&gt; varieties, and only when flowering is postponed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100559&quot;&gt;T. Gookin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists’ preference for using long growing days and fast-flowering conditions have helped keep cantils hidden in hundreds of labs worldwide, Gookin says.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The organs can develop in the wild, though some favorite, fast-growing &lt;em&gt;A. thaliana &lt;/em&gt;varieties have lost the genetic ability to produce cantils. It’s unclear how the plants use the organs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cantils are, so far, known to occur only in &lt;em&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/em&gt;. So the plant parts may not rewrite biology textbooks just yet. But after being found in a lab plant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plants-engineered-always-be-alert-do-not-grow-well&quot;&gt;that’s scrutinized so widely&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a reminder to keep observing closely (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/22/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

The foundation fosters and supports research on all aspects of computer vision, a field of study that develops techniques to see and interpret the visual world, with applications ranging from diagnosing disease to evaluating agricultural crop quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t donate because we were asked,” said Ramin Zabih, president and founder of CVF, Cornell Tech professor, and Google research scientist. “We donated because we love arXiv.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open access is a central tenet of the foundation, which (along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ieee.org/&quot;&gt;IEEE&lt;/a&gt;) cosponsors the two main computer vision conferences, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cvpr2021.thecvf.com/&quot;&gt;CVPR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://iccv2021.thecvf.com/home&quot;&gt;ICCV&lt;/a&gt;. Before the pandemic, CVPR drew more than 10,000 attendees. CVF also provides open access to the proceedings for these conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Without arXiv, the computer vision field would not advance at anything close to its current speed,” said Zabih. Conferences and journals are both useful venues for presenting and peer reviewing results. But the pace of research is fast, and arXiv provides an invaluable vehicle for rapid research sharing between conference and journal cycles. Plus, while the high bar for acceptance to conferences and journals serves an important purpose, arXiv provides a platform for lesser-known researchers to make their mark. “High profile researchers will always have ways to share their work, say, by being invited to give talks. arXiv levels the playing field,” said Zabih.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/funding&quot;&gt;arXiv recently launched an updated sustainability model&lt;/a&gt;, which distributes arXiv’s operational costs fairly across our dedicated community. This donation was the first Gold Affiliate through this sustainability model and is a continuation of The Computer Vision Foundation’s support, which began in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like earlier donations from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Heising-Simons Foundation, and Google, Inc, this contribution supports arXiv’s critical infrastructure improvements and integration with the scholarly communications landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“arXiv has been operating in maintenance mode for quite some time,” said Eleonora Presani, arXiv’s executive director. “With generous support from organizations like The Computer Vision Foundation, arXiv can innovate for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although we often think of young children as rather selfish, research has shown that babies and toddlers have a surprisingly strong sense of what is fair. At one year old, kids &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/do-kids-have-a-fundamental-sense-of-fairness/&quot;&gt;already expect resources to be divided fairly&lt;/a&gt; and for people to be helpful towards others. By two, they themselves &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/01/toddlers-have-an-instinct-for-fairness-and-generosity/&quot;&gt;tend to distribute resources equally&lt;/a&gt;, and would rather play with a fair adult than an unfair one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But at what point do young kids actually intervene when they see someone else acting fairly or unfairly? According to a series of studies in &lt;em&gt;Cognition&lt;/em&gt;, before they’re even one and a half years old children will reward someone for being fair — though they don’t yet punish unfair behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42566&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team, led by Talee Ziv from the University of Washington, first trained a group of 16-month-olds to use a touch screen to produce audio clips. Touching one side of the screen resulted in negative feedback (e.g. “She was bad”) while touching the other side produced positive feedback (e.g. “She was good”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The kids then saw four video clips, each showing a woman distributing crackers or Lego blocks to two other people. In two of the clips, the “distributor” divided up the resources fairly, but in the other two she gave one person more than the other (a different actor played the role of distributor in each of the four clips). After watching these videos, the toddlers were again shown the faces of the four distributors, and after seeing each one had 60 seconds to touch the screen as many times as they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that when the children saw the fair distributors, they touched the side of the screen that gave positive feedback significantly more often than the side that gave negative feedback. But when they saw the unfair distributors, there was no difference in the number of times they touched each side of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results suggested that the children were “rewarding” the fair actors with positive feedback. But it wasn’t clear that they really grasped the idea that the audio clips would be rewarding to the actor. So to ensure that the kids understood that their actions produced a clear reward or punishment, in a later study the researchers tweaked the methods so that touching one side of the screen produced a video of someone giving the actor a cookie, while touching the other side produced a video of someone taking a cookie away. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once again, the children rewarded the fair distributors by pressing the “give cookie” side of the screen more often than the “take cookie away” side. But they pressed each side of the screen equally when the distributors had acted unfairly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results suggest that toddlers reward those who are acting fairly, adding to the evidence that very young children have a strong sense of what is “right” or normative. But, interestingly, these kids don’t seem to punish those who have been unfair (in fact, the researchers suggest that the children instead tended to avoid making responses towards unfair distributors, as they touched the screen fewer times overall after seeing those who acted unfairly).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed to understand why toddlers don’t punish unfair actors. They might not see the actions as bad enough to warrant any kind of punishment, the team suggests, or could believe that punishment is only done by people in positions of authority. Or maybe the concept of punishment develops later than that of reward. Either way, the team concludes, the results imply that punishment is not simply the flip side of reward, but that the two are unique processes that may develop differently in children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027721002006&quot;&gt;Toddlers’ interventions toward fair and unfair individuals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/phantom-river-natural-noise-birds-bats-hunting-habits-ecosystems"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3100492</id>
		<updated>2021-06-15T11:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;For two summers in a rugged corner of Idaho’s Pioneer Mountains, the roar of rushing whitewater filled the air. But where the loud sounds prevailed, only gentle streams flowed by.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These phantom rivers were part of an experiment led by ecologist Dylan Gomes of Boise State University. He and colleagues were testing a hypothesis that the sounds of nature influence where animals lived and how they forage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of research suggesting that [human] noise negatively affects [animals], from communication to foraging to reproduction, and even survival,” Gomes says. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/noise-made-humans-can-be-bad-news-animals&quot;&gt;sounds of highway traffic can drive migrating birds away&lt;/a&gt; from their regular rest stops (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/9/15&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the natural soundscape is “one component of the niche that we’ve been ignoring,” says Gail Patricelli, an ecologist at the University of California, Davis who was not involved in the study. The phantom rivers experiment suggests we shouldn’t, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gomes and his team hauled about 3.5 metric tons of speakers, solar panels and other equipment into the countryside. Though they carried most of this gear on their backs, the researchers had to call on a mule train when an access road flooded during the first summer. At 60 study sites near streams, the researchers broadcast whitewater noise at different volumes and frequencies, or pitches, creating the auditory illusion of rushing rivers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;two ecologists carry solar panels in the field&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100496&quot; height=&quot;447&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061121_no_scilife-rivernoise_inline1_researchers.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100496&quot;&gt;Ecologist Dylan Gomes (right) and a colleague carry solar panels and other gear through the Pioneer Mountains in Idaho for an experiment gauging how natural sounds affect animal behavior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100496&quot;&gt;Cory Toth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the phantom rivers played, the researchers surveyed two prevalent, sound-dependent animal groups — birds and bats. Bats echolocate and listen for their prey, and birds communicate through song, Gomes explains. “They’re such sound specialists that it makes sense to focus on them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For each &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22390-y&quot;&gt;12 decibel increase in whitewater noise&lt;/a&gt; volume, bird abundance decreased by about 7 percent and bat activity decreased by about 8 percent, the researchers report May 24 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;. Birds were especially deterred by whitewater noise pitches that overlapped with birdsong. And for each 2 kilohertz increase in pitch, the overall activity of bats decreased by about 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amid all the noise, Gomes and his team deployed 720 fake caterpillars made of clay among willow trees often visited by birds. Overall, birds foraged less as noise volume increased, the team found, even though the creatures rely on vision to forage. The birds may find the noise distracting, similar to how a human would struggle to solve a crossword puzzle at a rock concert, Gomes says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;decoy caterpillar on a branch&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100495&quot; height=&quot;631&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061121_no_scilife-rivernoise_inline2_caterpillar.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1030&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100495&quot;&gt;As the phantom river became louder, birds foraged less for decoy caterpillars (one shown) that researchers scattered in trees throughout the Idaho countryside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100495&quot;&gt;Cory Toth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers similarly tested the impact of whitewater noise on bat foraging. They set up small speakers that played insect sounds to attract passive-listening, or “gleaning” bats.  Fluttering mechanical devices that mimicked flapping insect wings attracted active echolocating, or “hawking,” bats. In bat species that could both glean and hawk, gleaning behavior decreased and hawking increased when the researchers increased whitewater noise volume.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If changes in natural noises can so readily influence where animals live and how they forage, Gomes says, then it’s even more crucial to manage and mitigate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/peace-and-quiet-becoming-more-elusive-us-wild-areas&quot;&gt;rapidly encroaching noises of people&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/4/17&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-lizard-dinosaur-amber"/>

		<updated>2021-06-14T15:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A tiny creature caught in amber 99 million years ago isn’t the smallest dinosaur ever found. It is actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.05.040&quot;&gt;a lizard — albeit a really bizarre one&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report June 14 in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, scientists have puzzled over the nature of the strange, hummingbird-sized &lt;em&gt;Oculudentavis khaungraae&lt;/em&gt;, a fossil found in amber deposits in northwestern Myanmar. The fossil consists of only a birdlike, rounded skull with a slender tapering snout and a large number of teeth in its mouth, along with a lizardlike eye socket, deep and conical. The birdlike features led one team of scientists to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dinosaur-smallest-size-no-bigger-than-hummingbird&quot;&gt;identify the fossil as a miniature dinosaur&lt;/a&gt; — the smallest ever found (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/11/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But other scientists weren’t so sure. Another analysis of O. khaungraae’s strange assemblage of features suggested &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.993949v4&quot;&gt;it looked rather more like a weird lizard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, a third team of scientists reports the discovery of a second amber fossil that so closely resembles &lt;em&gt;O. khangraae&lt;/em&gt; as to belong to the same genus. And the new specimen, dubbed &lt;em&gt;O. naga&lt;/em&gt;, includes parts of the lower body that clearly reveal the members of genus &lt;em&gt;Oculudentavis&lt;/em&gt; to be lizards, say paleontologist Arnau Bolet of the Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont in Barcelona and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The researchers used CT scans to examine both specimens. &lt;em&gt;Oculudentavis’&lt;/em&gt; lizardlike features include scales, teeth attached to its jawbone directly rather than in sockets (as dinosaur teeth were) and a particular skull bone unique to squamates, or scaled reptiles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the creatures were markedly different from all other known lizards in their unusual combination of features, such as the rounded skulls and long tapering snouts, the researchers say — probably representing a previously unknown group of lizards.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Despite their mysterious nature, black holes are thought to follow certain simple rules. Now, one of the most famous black hole laws, predicted by physicist Stephen Hawking, has been confirmed with gravitational waves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the black hole area theorem, developed by Hawking in the early 1970s, black holes can’t decrease in surface area over time. The area theorem fascinates physicists because it mirrors a well-known physics rule that disorder, or entropy, can’t decrease over time. Instead, entropy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arrow-time&quot;&gt;consistently increases&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/10/15&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s “an exciting hint that black hole areas are something fundamental and important,” says astrophysicist Will Farr of Stony Brook University in New York and the Flatiron Institute in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The surface area of a lone black hole won’t change — after all, nothing can escape from within. However, if you throw something into a black hole, it will gain more mass, increasing its surface area. But the incoming object could also make the black hole spin, which decreases the surface area. The area law says that the increase in surface area due to additional mass will always outweigh the decrease in surface area due to added spin.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;To test this area rule, MIT astrophysicist Maximiliano Isi, Farr and others used ripples in spacetime stirred up by two black holes that spiraled inward and merged into one bigger black hole. A black hole’s surface area is defined by its event horizon — the boundary from within which it’s impossible to escape. According to the area theorem, the area of the newly formed black hole’s event horizon should be at least as big as the areas of the event horizons of the two original black holes combined.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction&quot;&gt;the first gravitational waves ever spotted&lt;/a&gt;, which were detected by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, LIGO, in 2015 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/11/16&lt;/em&gt;). The researchers split the gravitational wave data into two time segments, before and after the merger, and calculated the surface areas of the black holes in each period. The surface area of the newly formed black hole was greater than that of the two initial black holes combined, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/36074Y8aM291c462a4e264336d883136eb53c122b&quot;&gt;upholding the area law with a 95 percent confidence level&lt;/a&gt;, the team reports in a paper to appear in &lt;em&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s the first time that we can put a number on this,” Isi says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The area theorem is a result of the general theory of relativity, which describes the physics of black holes and gravitational waves. Previous analyses of gravitational waves have agreed with predictions of general relativity, and thus already hinted that the area law can’t be wildly off. But the new study “is a more explicit confirmation,” of the area law, says physicist Cecilia Chirenti of the University of Maryland in College Park, who was not involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, general relativity describes black holes well. But scientists don’t fully understand what happens where general relativity — which typically applies to large objects like black holes — meets quantum mechanics, which describes small stuff like atoms and subatomic particles. In that quantum realm, strange things can happen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, black holes can release a faint mist of particles called Hawking radiation, another idea developed by Hawking in the 1970s. That effect could allow black holes to shrink, violating the area law, but only over extremely long periods of time, so it wouldn’t have affected the relatively quick merger of black holes that LIGO saw.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Physicists are looking for an improved theory that will combine the two disciplines into one new, improved theory of quantum gravity. Any failure of black holes to abide by the rules of general relativity could point physicists in the right direction to find that new theory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So physicists tend to be grumpy about the enduring success of general relativity, Farr says. “We’re like, ‘aw, it was right again.’”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Earth is on an orderly path around the sun, orbiting in nearly the same plane as our star’s equator. In 2008, however, astronomers began finding worlds in other solar systems that sail far above and below their star’s equatorial plane.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now a surprising discovery about these wrong-way worlds may eventually reveal their origin: Most of them follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bulging-stars-mess-planets-seasons&quot;&gt;polar orbits&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/17/16&lt;/em&gt;). If Earth had such an orbit, every year we’d pass over the sun’s north pole, dive through its equatorial plane, then pass below the sun’s south pole before coming back up again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Astronomers Simon Albrecht and Marcus Marcussen at Aarhus University in Denmark and colleagues analyzed 57 planets in other solar systems for which the researchers could determine the true tilt between a planet’s orbit and its star’s equatorial plane. Two-thirds of the planets have normal orbits, tilted no more than 40 degrees, the team found. The other 19 planets are misaligned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the orbits of those misaligned planets don’t make just any old angle with their star’s equator. Instead, they pile up around 90 degrees. In fact, all but one of the misaligned planets &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09327&quot;&gt;are on polar orbits&lt;/a&gt;, having tilts from 80 to 125 degrees, the astronomers report online May 20 at arXiv.org.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“It’s very, very strange,” says Amaury Triaud, an astronomer at the University of Birmingham in England who has found a number of misaligned planets but was not involved with the new study. “It’s a beautifully executed idea, and the result is most intriguing,” he says. “It’s so new and so weird.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result may lend insight into the biggest mystery about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/first-tilted-solar-system-found&quot;&gt;these planets&lt;/a&gt;: how they arose (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/18/13&lt;/em&gt;). Such worlds were a shock to astronomers, because planets form inside pancake-shaped disks of gas and dust orbiting in their stars’ equatorial planes. Thus, planets should lie near the plane of their sun’s equator, too. In our solar system, for example, Earth’s orbit tilts only 7 degrees from the solar equatorial plane, and even Pluto — which many astronomers no longer call a planet — has an orbit tilted only 12 degrees from that plane (and 17 degrees from the Earth’s orbital plane).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At the moment, we are not sure what is the underlying mechanism” or mechanisms for creating misaligned planets, Albrecht admits. Whatever it is, though, it should account for the newly discovered plethora of perpendicular planets, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A possible clue, Albrecht says, comes from the single exception to the rule: the one misaligned planet in the sample that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on a polar orbit. This planet also happens to be the most massive in the sample, packing the mass of between five and eight Jupiters. Albrecht says that may be just a coincidence — or it may reveal something about how the other planets became misaligned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the future, the astronomers hope to understand how these wayward worlds acquired their odd orbits. All known misaligned planets orbit close to their stars, but are these worlds more likely than normal, close-in planets to have giant planets near them? The scientists don’t yet know, but if they find such a correlation, those companions may have somehow flung these bizarre worlds onto their peculiar planetary paths.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Elinor McKone admits that as a junior postdoctoral student, she was unable to recognise her other-race senior professor “by anything other than his coat”. McKone was, then, a perpetrator of the “other-race effect” (ORE) — the (well-documented) fact that we are generally poorer at recognising the faces of people of races other than our own. Now at the Australian National University, McKone has led the first formal investigation into how this phenomenon affects everyday social interactions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12508?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; of students of mostly Chinese heritage, who had recently moved to study in Australia, reveals that both being a victim and a perpetrator makes social interactions more difficult. In fact, the students found it to be as big of a hurdle to successful socialising as the language barrier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42556&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 89 students, all from east and south-east Asia, first completed a computer-based memory task, which measured their individual ability to recognise own-race versus other-race faces. Then they answered questions about how hard they had found it to socialise with White people in Australia and how much cultural or language barriers contributed to these difficulties.  They also indicated the extent to which the other-race effect was a barrier to socialising, both in terms of difficulties the students had had in recognising White people and matching their names to their faces, and in terms of their experience of White students or authority figures (such as tutors) confusing them with other Asian people. Finally, the students reported on how upsetting or difficult they found these experiences. (“Asian” and “White” are used here because these are the terms used by the researchers; they were chosen for being in general use by the students.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the other-race effect made a significant contribution to the students’ reported difficulties in socialising with White people. On the objective face recognition test, those who did worse at recognising other-race compared to own-race faces reported greater difficulties socialising. And participants themselves reported that experiences of being a either a victim or perpetrator of the other-race effect contributed equally to difficulties socialising — so struggles in recognising White people and being mis-recognised as another Asian person were both important. In fact, these experiences were perceived as being as important as the language barrier and only moderately less important than cultural differences. “In sum, these results show international students viewed ORE-related factors… as highly relevant factors to understanding their real-world difficulties socialising with White people,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of the 89% of participants who reported a White authority figure in their lives, 81% said they had had at least some experience of being confused by this person with other Asians. This caused distress and difficulty for 14% of this group. However, around half “largely shrugged off being an ORE victim,” the team writes. The reason for the striking variation in reactions isn’t clear. It might be to do with how frequently a person is confused for someone else, the team suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have looked at how the effect impacts court-room testimony, for example, in making an eye-witness more liable to misidentify someone of a race other than their own. But as the team writes, their new work shows that “it causes real-world problems in &lt;em&gt;common everyday situations experienced by all humans&lt;/em&gt;.” (Their italics.) And there are various further potential implications. If people cannot recognise other-race faces, they may choose to socialise more with people of their own race, encouraging segregation. Clearly, much more research is needed to understand the everyday impacts of this effect. And as effective strategies to combat it have so far proved elusive, there’s an urgent need for further study in this area, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12508&quot;&gt;Why the other-race effect matters: Poor recognition of other-race faces impacts everyday social interactions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 Abstract:  The goal of the open access (OA) movement is to help everyone access the scholarly research, not just those who can afford to. However, most studies looking at whether OA has met this goal have focused on whether other scholars are making use of OA research. Few have considered how the broader public, including the news media, uses OA research. This study sought to answer whether the news media mentions OA articles more or less than paywalled articles by looking at articles published from 2010 through 2018 in journals across all four quartiles of the Journal Impact Factor using data obtained through Altmetric.com and the Web of Science. Gold, green and hybrid OA articles all had a positive correlation with the number of news mentions received. News mentions for OA articles did see a dip in 2018, although they remained higher than those for paywalled articles.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;So far I was very fortunate with my scientific long-term mentors and supervisors: both of them are kind, open, creative and stunningly intelligent. I could not wish for more. However, when asked about a role model, I would mention a person that influenced my take on research, during a time when I still was studying physics, probably more than others: Pina Bausch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pina Bausch was a dancer and choreographer who mostly worked in the small town of Wuppertal, Germany, where she developed her own way of modern dance. Her works are creative and inventive in very unexpected ways, and the way she explored body movements as a dancer struck me as surprisingly similar to what I think is “research”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6839&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6839&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;pinabausch&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/pinabausch.png?w=592&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/pinabausch.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/pinabausch.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;592,463&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/pinabausch/&quot; height=&quot;499&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/pinabausch.png?w=592&quot; width=&quot;638&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research in its purest form is the exploration of the unknown, the discovery of what is not yet discovered, without a clear path ahead. The question that I’m working on in the broadest sense, “How does the brain work?”, enters the unknown very quickly as soon as you take the question seriously. How, in general, can we see what cannot be seen yet, how can we find ideas that do not yet exist?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pina Bausch was a master in this art. Her craft was not science or biology but dancing, but I think one can learn some lessons from her. It was typical of her to explore her own movements and to “invent” new movements, like wrist movements or coordinated movements of elbows and the head, or simply a slowed-down or delayed movement of the fingers. In regular life we use a rather limited and predefined combination of motor actions, and it takes some creativity to come up with movements that are unexpected and new but still interesting. One way to find new ways to move would be to consciously become aware of the own patterns and limitations and then try to systematically break those rules. However, Pina Bausch performed this discovery process in a different way. Her research was not guided by intellectual deduction or conclusion, but by her intuition. In 1992, she said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ich weiß nämlich immer, wonach ich suche, aber ich weiß es eher mit meinem Gefühl als mit meinem Kopf.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Because I always know what I’m searching for. But I know it with my heart and with my feeling rather than with my brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This might come over as a bit naive at first glance. Sure, an artist uses her heart, a scientist uses his brain, that sounds more or less normal, doesn’t it? However, when I saw Pina Bausch do this kind of searching, that is, when she danced, I was very impressed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She seemed to rely on her intuition on every single moment of her explorations; and when I heard her talk about it (unfortunately, I’m only aware of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f04Tk1pqQok&quot;&gt;interviews in German&lt;/a&gt; without translation), it was also clear that she did not have and did not need an explanation of what was going on. Most impressively for me, her way of exploring the unknown really struck me as similar to what is going on in a researcher, no matter the subject. What made her such an excellent researcher?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To me, it seems that the prerequisites of her impressive ability are the following: First of all, of course, a deeply engrained knowledge of and skill with her art, together with a honest care about the details. There’s no intuition without experience and knowledge. Second, an openness to whatever random things might happen and to accept them, coming from the outside or her inside. Third, an acceptance of the fact that she doesn’t really know what she’s doing. Or, to put this differently, a certain humility in the face of what is going to happen and what is going on in her own subconsciousness. I believe that these are qualities that also make for a good researcher in science.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also reflects my own experience of doing research (at least partially). Even when I was working with mathematical tools, for example when I was modeling diffusion processes in inhomogeneous media during my diploma thesis, I had the impression that my intuition was always a couple of steps ahead of myself. Often I could see the shape of the mathematical goal ahead of my derivations, and it would take me several days before I could bring it down to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course there are other ways to develop new ideas, and for some problems intuition also fails systematically (maybe complex systems?). And of course there are other kinds of research, for example the gradual optimization of methods, or the development of devices to solve a specific problem, or the broad and systematic screening of candidate genes or materials for a defined purpose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These systematic and step-wise procedures are more predictable than “pure” research, and the grant-based scientific research reinforces this kind of research. In a grant proposal, there are typically a defined number of “aims”. The more clearly defined these aims are, the better the chances of the grant proposal to be accepted. This makes sense. It would be ridiculous to fund a project with loosely defined aims, especially if other, competing proposals have a clear and realistic goal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, this necessary side-effect of grant-based research narrows our perspective on a kind of research that can be more or less clearly described even before doing it. It narrows down also the way how we talk about research and about results. We do not directly encourage young researchers to use and develop their intuition, as if this had nothing to do with the scientific process. In grants and progress reports and talks and papers, we try to use very concise, precise language, sharp and clean as steel (often completed by pieces of superficial math that are supposed to demonstrate precision), not only when describing our methods – but also when describing results and when interpreting the results. This is not bad by itself, but it shapes also the way we think about research, and it can lead to a situation where we internally might reject ideas or results that do not satisfy the desired clarity and cleanliness in a first step. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think that also researchers in “hard” sciences like neuroscience could benefit from a technique that uses intuitive thinking, and at least I have learnt a lot from the way Pina Bausch approached her subject of study using these techniques. Ultimately, understanding in neuroscience should always aim for descriptions in terms of words or math. But the way towards this goal does not need to be guided by these clear ways of thinking alone. From my experience, the power of intuition is only unleashed if we accept that we cannot really understand the process itself. Therefore, I see the humility that Pina Bausch showed towards her own intuitive thought process not simply as a simple virtue of a human being, but rather as a tool and a way of thinking that enables creativity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100597&quot; height=&quot;186&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061921_feedback_cover-144x186.jpg&quot; width=&quot;144&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Explosive snowflakes&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiny uranium crystals in the cores of white dwarf stars could trigger nuclear reactions that blow the stars apart, &lt;strong&gt;Emily Conover&lt;/strong&gt; reported in “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dead-stars-uranium-snowflakes-thermonuclear-supernova-explosions&quot;&gt;Uranium ‘snowflakes’ might spark supernovas&lt;/a&gt;” (&lt;/em&gt;SN: 4/24/21, p. 5&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two main types, or isotopes, of uranium on Earth are uranium-238 and uranium-235. But only uranium-235 is fissile, or can sustain a fission chain reaction, reader &lt;strong&gt;Leon Maya &lt;/strong&gt;noted, and this isotope is less common. &lt;strong&gt;Maya&lt;/strong&gt; wondered if the relationship between the isotopes also extends to white dwarfs.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The short answer is yes, &lt;strong&gt;Conover&lt;/strong&gt; says. Since uranium-235 is fissile, it is the isotope that could set off explosions in white dwarfs. And because it decays more quickly than uranium-238, uranium-235 is typically less abundant, whether on Earth or in white dwarfs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In general, scientists think that much of the uranium present in planets and stars &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gravitational-waves&quot;&gt;formed from neutron star mergers&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/11/17, p. 6&lt;/em&gt;). Earth has a low concentration of uranium-235 because the merger that forged its uranium happened quite a long time ago, &lt;strong&gt;Conover&lt;/strong&gt; says. “But a white dwarf that formed soon after a neutron star merger would have a significantly higher uranium-235 fraction than that on Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Tuning in to the cosmos&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A distant galaxy cluster emits an unusual radio wave pattern that is shaped like a giant jellyfish, &lt;strong&gt;Ken Croswell &lt;/strong&gt;reported in “ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/uss-jellyfish-galaxy-cluster-strange-radio-waves&quot;&gt;‘USS Jellyfish’ is a cosmic oddball&lt;/a&gt;” (&lt;/em&gt;SN: 4/24/21, p. 10&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Astronomers can detect the cluster at frequencies similar to those of FM radio stations, &lt;strong&gt;Croswell &lt;/strong&gt;reported. Reader &lt;strong&gt;Mike Neary &lt;/strong&gt;wondered why researchers consider these radio frequencies low, given that the frequencies reside in the International Telecommunication Union’s “very high frequency” band, which ranges from 30 to 300 megahertz.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Radio frequencies from 30 to 300 MHz are high for Earth but low for the cosmos, &lt;strong&gt;Croswell&lt;/strong&gt; says. Take the Low Frequency Array, or LOFAR. This radio telescope network detects cosmic frequencies between 10 and 240 MHz, the lowest frequencies observable from Earth. In contrast, the best-known frequency in radio astronomy, emitted by hydrogen atoms in space, is 1,420 MHz, a wavelength of 21 centimeters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Video killed the radio star&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoom and the COVID-19 pandemic helped usher in a new age of videocalling, a technology that consumers had rejected for decades, &lt;strong&gt;Anushree Dave&lt;/strong&gt; reported in “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/video-call-zoom-pandemic-popularity-phone-tech-history&quot;&gt;What took the videophone so long to catch on?&lt;/a&gt;” (&lt;/em&gt;SN: 4/24/21, p. 22&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several readers reflected on the technology’s social impact and what videocalling could mean for the future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reader &lt;strong&gt;Leah O’Connor &lt;/strong&gt;lauded the benefits videocalling provides for people who are deaf or have low hearing. “Zoom and some other platforms now have computer-generated captioning that is almost better than live captioning,” she wrote. “Videocalling also allows for lip reading and American Sign Language.… I hope videocalling never goes away.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though many people have relied on videocalling during the pandemic to foster a sense of togetherness and community, reader &lt;strong&gt;Mike Bushroe&lt;/strong&gt; meditated on the negative associations with the technology that some people might develop. People may learn to connect videocalling with the trauma of the pandemic, &lt;strong&gt;Bushroe&lt;/strong&gt; noted, including the shuttering of businesses and public venues, the isolation from loved ones, the economic impact of all the jobs lost and the risk of catching and possibly dying from the virus. Those negative associations might persist long after the pandemic, and people may have to heal from the trauma to “begin to think of Zoom meetings and get-togethers solely on their own merits,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While many readers looked ahead to videocalling’s future, &lt;strong&gt;Dave’s&lt;/strong&gt; story reminded reader &lt;strong&gt;A. Michael Noll&lt;/strong&gt; of his past as a researcher at Bell Telephone Laboratories and AT&amp;amp;T. “I published much about the Picturephone and worked on video conferencing [technology] in the 1970s,” &lt;strong&gt;Noll&lt;/strong&gt; wrote. He even contributed to the videophone sequence in the 1968 film &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Under the sea&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Octopuses snooze in brief, colorful bursts of REM-like activity, &lt;strong&gt;Laura Sanders&lt;/strong&gt; reported in “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-sleep-stages-active-color-quiet-rem-brain&quot;&gt;Octopus sleep is remarkably active&lt;/a&gt;” (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/24/21, p. 12&lt;/em&gt;). On Facebook, reader &lt;strong&gt;DeeDee Moran&lt;/strong&gt; wondered what the cephalopods dream about. “Their gardens in the shade!” reader &lt;strong&gt;Bodisky Fain &lt;/strong&gt;quipped, quoting the Beatles’ song “Octopus’s Garden.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sleeping octopus blushes deep red&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100598&quot; height=&quot;596&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061921_feedback_inline.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100598&quot;&gt;Sylvia Medeiros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The notion that a baby’s beginnings could transpire in a petri dish seems unremarkable today. But not even 50 years ago, researchers’ efforts to devise technologies to allow infertile couples to have a baby sparked fierce opposition on multiple fronts, raising alarms around designer babies and eugenics. Scientists were afraid too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sincere scientists … really believed they might be creating monsters,” says Robin Marantz Henig, who wrote this issue’s cover story on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysteries-reproduction-parenthood-ivf-fertilization&quot;&gt;the invention of assisted reproductive technologies&lt;/a&gt;, or ART. The article is part of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/century/about&quot;&gt;Century of Science&lt;/a&gt; series exploring major scientific advances of the last 100 years and their impact on society.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Henig, author of the book &lt;em&gt;Pandora’s Baby: How the First Test Tube Babies Sparked the Reproductive Revolution&lt;/em&gt; and a contributor to &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;New York Times Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, explains just how hard it was for scientists to decipher the many steps to making a baby. The struggle included some wacky experiments, including loading sperm into a tiny chamber and inserting it in a volunteer’s uterus to “prime” the sperm for action. It later turned out that no priming was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The debates over whether ART posed a threat to the future of humankind helped bioethics come of age, Henig says. With the rise of new reproductive technologies came the realization among scientists and regulators that braking mechanisms are necessary to give society time to assess potential impacts. We’re seeing those concerns rise again around the very real notion of using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology on human embryos.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But after the first “test tube baby,” Louise Brown, was born in July 1978, and more healthy babies followed, concern about ART quickly evaporated. “People were just so desperate,” Henig says. These days having a child via in vitro fertilization is a routine option, and it has made parenthood possible for millions of people, including cancer patients, same-sex couples and single parents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Henig imagines a future for reproductive technologies that might include creating egg and sperm cells by reprogramming a bit of one’s own skin — no sex cells (or partners) needed. “You just take a sample of cells from someone when she’s ready to have a baby,” Henig speculates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “kids-from-my-skin” approach, if it comes to pass, could once again spark concerns about how science can rescript a process that is central to the essence of who we are. And if not this, then some other approach certainly will. We’ll continue to add new content to the Century of Science series through April 2022, with excerpts in the magazine and longer stories available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/century/about&quot;&gt;www.sciencenews.org/century&lt;/a&gt;. Online, you can explore a specific field of science, or compare across fields to see what was happening in, say, neuroscience, public health and quantum mechanics in the 1930s. We’re also writing profiles of the people who made these discoveries possible, many of whom were under-appreciated at the time. We’re thoroughly enjoying this opportunity to celebrate &lt;em&gt;Science News’ &lt;/em&gt;centennial by exploring an extraordinary century of innovation and discovery, and we hope you are enjoying it too.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mouse-sperm-dna-space-radiation-exposure-six-years"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Sperm appears to be unfazed by long stints in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the longest biological experiment on the International Space Station yet, freeze-dried mouse sperm remained viable after nearly six years in space. Exposure to space radiation &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abg5554&quot;&gt;didn’t seem to harm the sperm’s DNA&lt;/a&gt; or the cells’ ability to produce healthy “space pups,” researchers report online June 11 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That may be good news for future spacefarers. Scientists have worried that chronic exposure to space radiation might not only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-lunar-lander-moon-radiation-health-risks-astronauts&quot;&gt;put astronauts at risk for cancer and other diseases&lt;/a&gt;, but also create mutations in their DNA that could be passed down to future generations (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/25/20&lt;/em&gt;). The new results hint that deep-space travelers could safely bear children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studying how space radiation affects reproduction is tricky. Instruments on Earth can’t perfectly mimic space radiation, and the ISS lacks freezers for long-term cell storage. So biologist Teruhiko Wakayama of the University of Yamanashi in Kōfu, Japan and colleagues freeze-dried sperm, allowing it to be stored at room temperature. The team then sent sperm from 12 mice to the space station, while keeping other sperm from the same mice on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After returning the sperm cells to Earth, rehydrating them and injecting them into fresh mouse eggs, the team transferred those embryos to female mice. About 240 healthy space pups were born from sperm kept on the ISS for nearly three years; about 170 others were born from sperm kept on the space station for nearly six years. Genetic analyses revealed no differences between these space pups and mice born from sperm stored on the ground. Space pups that mated as adults had healthy children and grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though these results are promising, they may not capture the full the effects of space radiation, since the ISS is partially shielded from radiation by Earth’s magnetic field. Also, space radiation damages DNA, at least in part, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronauts-mars-space-health-survival&quot;&gt;shattering water molecules in cells&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/15/20&lt;/em&gt;). Since freeze-dried sperm didn’t contain water, it may have been especially resistant to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/why-its-difficult-for-children-to-understand-sarcasm-160915&quot;&gt;Penny Paxman explains&lt;/a&gt; why children don’t fully grasp sarcasm until they are around seven to ten years old. &lt;/strong&gt;Understanding why someone is being sarcastic relies on quite sophisticated cognitive processes — not just those directly related to language, but also the ability to empathise and think about another person’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tamer breeds of cattle tend to have smaller brains,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/06/tamer-cow-smaller-brain&quot;&gt;reports Michael Price&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. The researchers think that because humans have selectively bred beef and dairy cows to be calm and gentle, over time the brain areas involved in aggression have shrunk. The work is consistent with other studies finding that domesticated dogs, pigs and other animals have smaller brains that their wild counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurological and psychiatric symptoms are common even in mild cases of COVID-19, a review of studies has found. &lt;/strong&gt;Loss of taste or smell, weakness and fatigue were each reported by around half of those who had COVID-19 but weren’t hospitalised, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2279780-many-people-with-covid-19-have-neurological-or-psychiatric-symptoms/?utm_campaign=RSS%7CNSNS&amp;amp;utm_source=NSNS&amp;amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;amp;utm_content=news&quot;&gt;according to a story&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroscientists think that for our brains to represent the world accurately, a similar pattern of neurons must fire whenever we have the same perceptual experience. &lt;/strong&gt;So a new study has left researchers puzzled, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/06/the-brain-isnt-supposed-to-change-this-much/619145/?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;writes Ed Yong&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic. &lt;/em&gt;The team found that when mice sniffed the same smell over a period of weeks, the group of cells in the smell-identifying region of their brains gradually changed, so that a month later it was almost a completely different set of neurons from that at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Roughly six months ago, on December 11, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the first COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use in the United States. What followed was a push to get that shot, developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-who-should-get-vaccines-first&quot;&gt;to those at high risk&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/1/20&lt;/em&gt;). Moderna’s jab &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-fda-approval&quot;&gt;wasn’t far behind&lt;/a&gt;, securing emergency use authorization just a week &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-authorize-pfizer-vaccine-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic&quot;&gt;after Pfizer’s&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/17/20; SN: 12/11/20&lt;/em&gt;). And then in February 2021, there were three COVID-19 vaccines when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-one-shot-fda-authorization&quot;&gt;FDA authorized Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s shot&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/27/21&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, around 40 percent of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated. Just over half of residents have gotten at least one dose. Meanwhile, U.S. cases of COVID-19 and deaths have plunged to their lowest levels since March 2020.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amid the ongoing effort to vaccinate people, two big questions loom: Will immune protection against the coronavirus be long-lived? Or will people soon need booster shots?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Right now, “no one knows” if boosters will be necessary, says Kirsten Lyke, a vaccinologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. But researchers are working on figuring that out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we know so far about coronavirus immunity and potential booster shots. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Immunity lasts at least six months and possibly much longer.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether people need COVID-19 booster shots or not largely hinges on how long the body’s immune response protects against getting severely ill. So far, this protection lasts at least six months and possibly much longer, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Much of what scientists know right now about long-term immunity comes from what they have gleaned from people infected with the coronavirus. And it appears that immune memory to the virus largely follows the rules, at least for most people, says Ali Ellebedy, an immunologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means that after the virus gains a foothold, the body unleashes a wave of immune proteins called antibodies and immune cells dubbed T cells to fight off the virus. Antibodies typically attack the virus itself while T cells raise additional alarm bells or kill infected cells. Together, antibodies and T cells defeat the virus and then help the immune system form a memory of the pathogen, Ellebedy says. That immune memory is crucial for protection if a person gets exposed to the virus again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies are uncovering evidence that most people develop immune memory to the coronavirus. Ellebedy has found signs of antibody memory, for instance, in people who recovered from an infection. People who had mild COVID-19 had long-lived &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03647-4&quot;&gt;antibody-producing immune cells in the bone marrow&lt;/a&gt; 11 months after infection, he and colleagues reported May 24 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. These cells continue to make antibodies against the virus long after it has left the body, providing protection if a person is exposed again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evidence is building that the vaccines offer similar, if not better, protection. In that case, boosters might not be needed for some time. In the last update from vaccine developers, “things looked pretty good,” Lyke says. People who received Moderna’s shot still&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2103916&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2103916&quot;&gt;have high levels of antibodies six months after getting the second dose&lt;/a&gt;, researchers reported in April. And Pfizer’s jab&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-confirm-high-efficacy-and-no-serious#:~:text=Footer%20Aside%20Section1-,Pfizer%20and%20BioNTech%20Confirm%20High%20Efficacy%20and%20No%20Serious%20Safety,Landmark%20COVID%2D19%20Vaccine%20Study&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-confirm-high-efficacy-and-no-serious#:~:text=Footer%20Aside%20Section1-,Pfizer%20and%20BioNTech%20Confirm%20High%20Efficacy%20and%20No%20Serious%20Safety,Landmark%20COVID%2D19%20Vaccine%20Study&quot;&gt;has an efficacy of 91.3 percent against COVID-19 symptoms after six months&lt;/a&gt;, the pharmaceutical company announced April 1 in a news release.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, “we don’t know how any of these COVID-19 vaccines perform past the one-year mark,” Lyke says. The earliest trials that tested whether the vaccines &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-oxford-cansino-pfizer-immune-response&quot;&gt;prompt an immune response&lt;/a&gt; are just now reaching that point, and researchers are following up with participants (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/21/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Coronavirus variants could make booster shots more likely.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even if the protection provided by the immune system is long-lasting, viruses like the coronavirus are adept at evading those responses. Case in point: the emergence of viral variants that can make COVID-19 vaccines &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-pandemic-vaccine-questions-immunity-variants&quot;&gt;less effective than they are against the original version&lt;/a&gt; of the virus (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/11/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think we would be talking about potentially boosting” if it weren’t for the variants, Ellebedy says. “What we are seeing so far is that the vaccine is really robust, so why would we even need a booster if the virus doesn’t change?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Available vaccines still protect people from the worst of COVID-19, even if they’re infected by one of the circulating variants. But that might not always be the case. “There may be a future variant that we’re unaware of that may come down and surprise us,” Lyke says. Still, multiple COVID-19 vaccines are flexible in design and can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccines-coronavirus-variants-challenges&quot;&gt;easily be adapted&lt;/a&gt; to tackle new variants (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/27/21&lt;/em&gt;). Then, it becomes a matter of manufacturing the doses.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, are already testing booster shots to fight emerging variants, in particular, the beta variant that first emerged in South Africa. Early results from Moderna hint that people who received a booster shot that uses the version of a viral protein from the beta variant had antibodies that were better at stopping the variant from infecting cells compared with people who got a third dose of the original vaccine.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, one question is what the best variant booster might look like, says Jerome Kim, a vaccinologist and director-general of the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul, South Korea. Researchers around the globe meticulously monitor circulating influenza strains, for example, to figure out which strain or strains should be included in flu vaccines. In the future, experts may need to keep an eye on the coronavirus in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Low vaccination rates worldwide may also make booster shots more likely.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As countries like the United States begin to emerge from the worst of the pandemic, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-global-inequity-vaccines-deaths-economy-pandemic&quot;&gt;many others lagging behind in vaccinations&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/26/21&lt;/em&gt;). That’s in part because wealthy countries have bought the bulk of available doses to vaccinate their populations, leaving lower-income countries struggling to get shots.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To date, more than 2 billion doses have made it into arms around the world. Some countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Chile and Israel, have given at least one dose to around 60 percent of their populations. But around only 1 percent of people in places like Nigeria and Sierra Leone have gotten at least one vaccine dose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Low vaccination rates in many places pose a problem for efforts to quell transmission and bring the pandemic to an end. And the more the coronavirus spreads, the more opportunities there will be for new variants to emerge, increasing the likelihood of booster shots. The coronavirus “has managed to find the gaps, like any virus,” Kim says. “It’s in the nature of viruses to find the weak points. And before you know it, there’s another mutant.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some countries are flying blind due to a lack of genetic surveillance. Bolstering that ability in regions like Africa, Latin America and South Asia would help get a handle on coronavirus diversity in those places and capture emerging variants before they become a global problem.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to get vaccines to the places that need them through efforts like COVAX, an international initiative to help distribute COVID-19 to low-income countries. “We have to start going to the places that have really bad outbreaks because we know mutants will be generated,” Kim says.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;“Mix-and-match” COVID boosters might offer even more protection.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To prepare for a future where people need COVID-19 boosters, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases launched a clinical trial on June 1 to test &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-evaluating-mixed-covid-19-vaccine-schedules-begins&quot;&gt;mixing and matching COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The big question is whether mix-and-match vaccines strengthen the immune response against the coronavirus, says Lyke, one of the researchers leading the trial. If someone is given an mRNA vaccine, like Moderna or Pfizer’s, and then is given a Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson booster, “can we increase [the immune response] by switching up the platform?” Lyke says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mixing different types of Ebola vaccines or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aids-hiv-vaccine-anniversary-immunity-antibodies&quot;&gt;HIV vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, for example, can trigger stronger immune responses than getting multiple doses of the same vaccine (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/4/21&lt;/em&gt;). The idea is that each shot will activate multiple parts of the immune system, Lyke says. An mRNA vaccine might prompt the body to make lots of antibodies that attack the virus. Then a dose of a vaccine like Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s — which uses a common cold virus that has been modified so it can’t cause disease — might trigger more T cells. “If you combine [the shots], we hope to prove that you get the best of both responses that work synergistically,” Lyke says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early results from a similar trial being conducted in the United Kingdom hint that the answer for COVID-19 shots is yes. People given AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 shot followed by a dose of Pfizer’s eight weeks later developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.30.21257971v1.full.pdf&quot;&gt;potent immune responses&lt;/a&gt;, researchers reported in a preliminary study posted June 1 at medRxiv.org. Antibodies from people who received the two different vaccines were better at recognizing variants like beta compared with those in people who got two doses of Pfizer’s vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A separate study in Spain also found that people given a dose of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 shot followed by a dose of Pfizer’s had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isciii.es/Noticias/Noticias/Paginas/Noticias/Presentaci%c3%b3n-resultados-preliminares-CombivacS.aspx&quot;&gt;high levels of antibodies&lt;/a&gt; compared with people who got only one dose of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, researchers reported in May. But it’s unclear how those levels compare with people who got two doses of the same shot.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One benefit of the U.S. trial is that it has a flexible design, Lyke says. That means that if new variants arise, researchers can add new groups to the trial to test newly developed boosters. “As we get data [about variants] that comes in from other countries, we can really start to hone in on holes in our data and what we need to answer.”    &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/galaxy-giant-arc-3-billion-light-years-long-cosmology-space"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3100436</id>
		<updated>2021-06-10T18:01:38+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A giant arc of galaxies appears to stretch across more than 3 billion light-years in the distant universe. If the arc turns out to be real, it would challenge a bedrock assumption of cosmology: that on large scales, matter in the universe is evenly distributed no matter where you look.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It would overturn cosmology as we know it,” said cosmologist Alexia Lopez at a June 7 news conference at the virtual American Astronomical Society meeting. “Our standard model, not to put it too heavily, kind of falls through.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lopez, of the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, England, and colleagues discovered the purported structure, which they call simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9363/presentation/874&quot;&gt;the Giant Arc&lt;/a&gt;, by studying the light of about 40,000 quasars captured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Quasars are the luminous cores of giant galaxies so distant that they appear as points of light. While en route to Earth, some of that light gets absorbed by atoms in and around foreground galaxies, leaving &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmic-cloak-controls-galaxy-future-coming-focus&quot;&gt;specific signatures in the light&lt;/a&gt; that eventually reaches astronomers’ telescopes (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/12/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Giant Arc’s signature is in magnesium atoms that have lost one electron, in the halos of galaxies about 9.2 billion light-years away. The quasar light absorbed by those atoms traces out a nearly symmetrical curve of dozens of galaxies spanning about one-fifteenth the radius of the observable universe, Lopez reported. The structure itself is invisible on the sky to human eyes, but if you could see it, the arc would span about 20 times the width of the full moon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image of blue dots that signify quasars with dark halo spots&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100438&quot; height=&quot;550&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/060921_lg_giant-space-arc_inline_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100438&quot;&gt;Astronomers discovered what they say is a giant arc of galaxies (smile-shaped curve in the middle of this image) by using the light from distant quasars (blue dots) to map out where in the sky that light got absorbed by magnesium atoms in the halos (dark spots) that surround foreground galaxies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100438&quot;&gt;A. Lopez&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a very fundamental test of the hypothesis that the universe is homogeneous on large scales,” says astrophysicist Subir Sarkar of the University of Oxford, who studies large-scale structures in the universe but was not involved in the new work. If the Giant Arc is real, “this is a very big deal.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Sarkar isn’t convinced it is real yet. “Our eye has a tendency to pick up patterns,” Sarkar says, noting that some people have claimed to see cosmologist Stephen Hawking’s initials written in fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, the oldest light in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Lopez ran three statistical tests to figure out the odds that galaxies would line up in a giant arc by chance. All three suggest that the structure is real, with one test surpassing physicists’ gold standard that the odds of it being a statistical fluke are less than 0.00003 percent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That sounds pretty good, but it may not be enough, Sarkar says. “Right now, I would say the evidence is tantalizing but not yet compelling,” he says. More observations, from Lopez’s group and others, could confirm or refute the Giant Arc.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;If it is real, the Giant Arc would join a growing group of large-scale structures in the universe that, taken together, would break the standard model of cosmology. This model assumes that when you look at large enough volumes of space — above about 1 billion light-years — matter is distributed evenly. The Giant Arc appears about three times as long as that theoretical threshold. It joins other structures with similarly superlative names, like the Sloan Great Wall, the Giant Gamma-Ray Burst Ring and the Huge Large Quasar Group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We can have one large-scale structure that could just be a statistical fluke,” Lopez said. “That’s not the problem. All of them combined is what makes the problem even bigger.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;On February 7, a massive flood rushed through a valley in India’s Himalayan Uttarakhand state, washing out two hydroelectric power plants and leaving at least 200 people dead or missing. What triggered the deadly flood has been a mystery — but after amassing evidence from satellite images, seismic records and eyewitness accounts, a team of over 50 scientists now say they have solved the case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ultimate culprit was &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abh4455&quot;&gt;a massive avalanche of rock and glacier ice&lt;/a&gt; that tumbled 1,800 meters down a steep slope of Ronti Peak, setting off a cascade of events that led to the disaster, the researchers report online June 10 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This was no ordinary landslide, says Daniel Shugar, a geomorphologist at the University of Calgary in Canada. “This was a multi-hazard scenario where it was much more fluid and mobile than a landslide would be expected to be. It was a worst-case scenario of rock and ice and [the] height of the fall.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;This animation shows the progress of the avalanche, as it rushes downslope toward the two hydroelectric dams at Tapovan. Colors show which material was dominant in the avalanche as it flowed. At the start, where the avalanche is colored red, it was mostly (about 80 percent) rock and 20 percent ice. Green is mostly ice, as the rocks begin to splash or settle out. By the time the flow reached Tapovan, it had become mostly water (blue).&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initially, the culprit was suspected to be a well-known high mountain hazard called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/india-glacier-flood-disaster-himalayas-uttarakhand&quot;&gt;glacial lake outburst flood&lt;/a&gt;, in which dammed-up water suddenly spills over its bounds and rushes down the mountainside (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/9/21&lt;/em&gt;). But what little data were available in the immediate aftermath pointed to a possible landslide instead, Shugar says.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In the months that followed, he and his colleagues used numerous sources of data as well as computer simulations to painstakingly reconstruct what happened that day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the data show:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Starting around 10:21 a.m. local time on February 7, about 27 million cubic meters of rock and ice fell from the steep north face of Ronti Peak, which stands 6,063 meters above sea level. The landslide, consisting of about 80 percent rock and 20 percent ice, originated at a height of about 5,500 meters and tumbled downslope about 1,800 meters, traveling at a speed of up to 60 meters per second.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;photo of the side of a mountain&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100449&quot; height=&quot;542&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/061021_CG_india-landslide_inline-680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100449&quot;&gt;On February 9, two days after the disastrous flood, France’s Pléiades satellites snapped this high-resolution image of Ronti Peak, showing a scar on the steep north face of the mountain spanning 500 meters. That scar, a new feature, marks the origin of the avalanche of rock and ice that caused the flood. Using stereo images from these satellites, researchers also constructed high-resolution 3-D models of the site, which allowed them to estimate the volume of the avalanche.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100449&quot;&gt;© CNES, Airbus DS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Digital elevation models now reveal a rock scar on the slope that wasn’t there previously. Earlier images of the site suggest that a very long and wide fracture in the overhanging glacier had opened up by 2018.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the landslide then rushed down the Ronti Gad stream valley, wet material splashed up the valley’s sides, depositing sediment and large boulders on the valley walls. Satellite images also captured thick blankets of airborne dust — the first indicators that a landslide might be the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the landslide continued downhill, the ice began to melt due to the friction, helping to speed it along. Then, the landslide encountered a sharp bend in the valley, and much of the solid material dropped out, shifting it from a thick, viscous flow to a faster-moving, more fluid flow. These rushing waters were now on their way to the two hydroelectric power plants in their path downstream. Eyewitness accounts saw only this part of the flood.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;WOW – @planetlabs has updated image of  &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/UttarakhandDisaster?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#UttarakhandDisaster&lt;/a&gt;. Looks like massive dust deposition over much of W side of the valley and the trigger appears to be the landslide scar that I discovered a few minutes ago. So NOT a typical GLOF. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davepetley?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@davepetley&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BhambriRakesh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@BhambriRakesh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/irfansalroo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@irfansalroo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/kXF2fNp2ui&quot;&gt;https://t.co/kXF2fNp2ui&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/m04DXLJnv1&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/m04DXLJnv1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dr Dan Shugar (@WaterSHEDLab) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WaterSHEDLab/status/1358442899713662977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;On February 7, the day of the disaster, a constellation of miniature cube satellites belonging to private imaging company Planet Labs snapped these images of vast dust deposits scattered across the valley below Ronti Peak but above the hydroelectric dams. These images were among the first clues that a landslide, rather than a glacial lake outburst flood, was responsible for the disaster.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are no easy answers for whether or how people can prepare for such a disaster — but the first step is a better understanding of possible causes, Shugar says. That’s where he hopes that this study can help. “We need to be doing a better job of hazard assessments, and not examining hazards in singularity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for what role climate change may have played, it’s also difficult to say. There are no weather stations close to the site of the original slope failure that could provide temperature or precipitation measurements to assess changing climate in that region. But “we can say that climate change is increasing the severity and frequency of natural disasters,” by thinning glaciers and their underpinnings, Shugar says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it’s also clear that increasing development in the mountains compounds the likelihood of disaster, adding to the urgency of understanding the possible dangers, he notes. “If the mountains themselves are becoming more hazardous, and we’re also pushing farther into those mountains, that becomes a dangerous mix.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/Hendriks-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to our &lt;strong&gt;SDG Editorial Board Members&lt;/strong&gt; blog collection. We are hearing from the Editorial Board Members of the BMC Series journals whose work aligns with achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Here you can find other posts in this collection, grouped with the tag ‘SDG editorial board members‘.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actively advancing the SDGs – an exciting, challenging and rewarding journey  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tod&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12430&quot; height=&quot;170&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/SDG2-300x170.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;ay’s societal challenges are complex. Tackling the complexity requires that researchers with diverse backgrounds actively work together. Transdisciplinary research provides exciting opportunities to unravel the complexity and explore solutions. Over the past two decades, I have been privileged to work at the interface of these challenges – at the global, African and country-level. I have also trained a cadre of professionals in adopting transdisciplinary mindsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research and policy work focuses primarily on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/&quot;&gt;SDG 2&lt;/a&gt; that seeks to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. However, this SDG touches all other SDGs and underpins the human rights fundamental to achieving all other SDGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant challenge in working on SDG2 is the diverse understandings of its components. I have found that the essential starting point is to make sure everyone around the table understands what we are discussing – in meetings with communities, policymakers or researchers. Assuming everyone is on the same page is a monumental mistake. Even in the international domain, SDG2 is often incorrectly labelled ‘ending hunger’ – only one element of SDG2. Hunger is an extreme (acute) form of food insecurity but also includes other outcomes such as malnutrition and the complexities of the coexistence of undernourishment and obesity in poor communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these misconceptions relate to views that food security relates only to production rather than considering the inter-linked core elements of food security: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/3/ca9731en/ca9731en.pdf&quot;&gt;availability, access, nutrition, resilience, agency and sustainability&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, this 1970’s production perspective has changed with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03031853.2018.1479974&quot;&gt;deeper understanding of food insecurity and its causes&lt;/a&gt;. Malnutrition is often understood as undernutrition rather than embracing all forms of malnutrition: undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies (often termed ‘hidden hunger’) and overweight (including obesity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, food security is &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12571-015-0457-6.pdf&quot;&gt;not a static condition&lt;/a&gt;. Households can become more or less food insecure over time or seasons. Simultaneously achieving the four inter-linked elements of the SDG2 is the focus of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/en/food-systems-summit&quot;&gt;September 2021 United Nations Food Systems Summit&lt;/a&gt;. All four elements of SDG2 are outcomes of sustainable food systems but require specific actions to ensure that the elements of food systems work together to deliver on SDG2. The food systems approach provide ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/en/food-systems-summit/action-tracks&quot;&gt;lenses’&lt;/a&gt; to examine the effectiveness of food system components and stakeholders. Food systems approaches can help identify opportunities to address failures and tradeoffs in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of study related to SDG2 is changing rapidly, making research in this field exciting, challenging and rewarding.  Working in this field has led to opportunities to work with diverse international transdisciplinary teams. From these treasured engagements, I have learnt an enormous amount about many topics that touch on, underly and shape research on SDG2. These opportunities have included drafting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.interacademies.org/publication/opportunities-future-research-and-innovation-food-and-nutrition-security-and&quot;&gt;consensus reports&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiNvN2O14zxAhXGiVwKHb5TDu4QFjAAegQIAhAD&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mamopanel.org%2Fresources%2FNutrition%2Freports-and-briefings%2Fnourished-how-africa-can-build-future-free-hunger2%2F&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1Mmaru-77mGAncdaz1WLfB&quot;&gt;regional&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/cfs/cfs-hlpe/hlpe-reports/en/&quot;&gt;international foci&lt;/a&gt; to direct scientific input into international processes such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.48565/scfss2021-wg92&quot;&gt;United Nations Food Systems Summit preparation&lt;/a&gt; to embarking on &lt;a href=&quot;https://sc-fss2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/UNFSS_true_cost_of_food.pdf&quot;&gt;challenging research analysis&lt;/a&gt; with relatively large teams of international experts. My work enabled participation in the drafting of the United Nations High-Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition, which first &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3901e.pdf&quot;&gt;defined food systems in 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through these opportunities, one learns how to share your own knowledge in a way that others outside of your field of expertise can understand while building your own knowledge from the engagement with others. Such engagement requires flexibility in thinking and the willingness to expand your scope of knowledge. It requires a great deal of listening and learning – something that does not come naturally to Professors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are only nine years left before the end of the SDG era (2016 – 2030), we still have so much to learn about how to face, embrace and overcome the complexity of the issues related to SDG2. I believe that the opportunities afforded by the digital connectivity during the COVID pandemic have helped significantly advance our understanding of SDG2 in the context of food systems. The continual engagement by a range of stakeholders with the UN Food Systems Summit preparation has enabled the identification of ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/en/food-systems-summit/news/food-systems-game-changers-reflections&quot;&gt;game changing’&lt;/a&gt; solutions to advance progress on the SDGs. These solutions offer guidance on the future directions for researchers committed to supporting progress on the SDGs and SDG2 in particular. There are also opportunities for researchers to track the implementation and effectiveness of the solutions chosen by food systems stakeholders – albeit countries or the private sector. Stepping up to these opportunities will inform progress towards 2030 and provide the evidence base to inform the subsequent development era (post the SDGs).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For many, moving out of the family home is a rite of passage, a sign that adulthood is just about to begin. Equally, however, there are plenty of reasons why somebody might move back &lt;em&gt;in &lt;/em&gt;with their parents: after a break-up, to save money, for health reasons, or to care for ageing or unwell relatives. Anecdotally, the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have been another reason for such a move, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/11/11/adult-children-move-back-parents-pandemic-costing-425-month/&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/mar/18/ill-cherish-these-moments-how-covid-has-swelled-the-boomerang-generation&quot;&gt;proliferating&lt;/a&gt; on children once more living with their parents and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/adult-children-parents-home-pandemic/2021/01/18/3e55ef70-5696-11eb-a817-e5e7f8a406d6_story.html&quot;&gt;offering advice&lt;/a&gt; on how to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But how do such “boomerang kids” frame their decision to move back home, and how do they ensure it goes well? A &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/21676968211012584&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Emerging Adulthood&lt;/em&gt; finds four strategies young people use to make the transition back into the family home as positive as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42532&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were 31 young adults, aged between 18 and 35, who had moved back into the family home. Researchers interviewed the participants on their experiences, before conducting an analysis of the data to pull out the key themes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The analysis found an overarching concern for boomerang kids: framing their move as an “investment in the future” rather than something to be ashamed of. Multiple participants acknowledged the stigma of moving back home, with one expressing that it “made me feel insecure in my success… that others may judge me for it”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This stigma, however, was frequently turned on its head and reframed as a positive decision for the future: participants mentioned the financial security it had given them, the increased likelihood of returning to university or graduate school due to this security, and the opportunity to get advice and support from parents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also pulled out four communication strategies that participants used to navigate the move back home in a way that both reduced the experience of stigma and allowed them to have adult relationships with their parents. The first was to develop clear expectations with their parents in order to assert boundaries and set out what living together would look like in reality. Those discussions revolved around topics like curfews, meal times, chores, and other responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, all participants saw contributions to the household as an important factor in destigmatising the move back home and making sure relationships worked well. These contributions included cooking, running errands, paying rent and doing other practical tasks, as well as making emotional contributions by listening to parents and sharing feelings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants also indicated that it was important to make sure that parents knew the move was only temporary, and in some cases they shared a specific timeline. One participant noted the importance of “having a next step”: “I told them it would be a two year commitment and we’re pretty much on track for that.” This also helped with cultural stigma and shame: seeing the move as a time-bound transition period helped participants accept their move and frame it as a logical step.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, participants stressed that engaging in “mature, responsible, adult behaviour” was key: waking up early, setting and keeping to routines and responsibilities, and functioning independently. For some, this stopped them from reverting back to their “child identity” when living at home, and established an adult relationship with parents that differed in dynamic from child or teen years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although family relationships will clearly differ from unit to unit, particularly when factoring in different geographies and cultural expectations, overall the interviews provide good insight not only into the reality of moving home, but into how to actually navigate it as well. Future research could look more closely at the &lt;em&gt;differences&lt;/em&gt; in people’s experiences, and how this relates to personality type, background, and other individual factors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/21676968211012584&quot;&gt;A Normative Approach to Understanding How “Boomerang Kids” Communicatively Negotiate Moving Back Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Michael Schmuker will talk about a paper &quot;Feed-Forward and Noise-Tolerant Detection of Feature Homogeneity in Spiking Networks with a Latency Code&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In studies of the visual system as well as in computer vision, the
focus is often on contrast edges. However, the primate visual system
contains a large number of cells that are insensitive to spatial
contrast and, instead, respond to uniform homogeneous illumination of
their visual field. The purpose of this information remains unclear.
Here, we propose a mechanism that detects feature homogeneity in
visual areas, based on latency coding and spike time coincidence, in a
purely feedforward and therefore rapid manner. We demonstrate how
homogeneity information can interact with information on contrast
edges to potentially support rapid image segmentation. Furthermore, we
analyze how neuronal crosstalk (noise) affects the mechanism's
performance. We show that the detrimental effects of crosstalk can be
partly mitigated through delayed feed-forward inhibition that shapes
bi-phasic postsynaptic events. The delay of the feed-forward
inhibition allows effectively controlling the size of the temporal
integration window and, thereby, the coincidence threshold. The
proposed model is based on single-spike latency codes in a purely
feed-forward architecture that supports low-latency processing, making
it an attractive scheme of computation in spiking neuronal networks
where rapid responses and low spike counts are desired.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;For the past few months, I’ve been working on a machine learning research project, which I just submitted to NeurIPS. The scale is, all things considered, fairly small: the output limited to one paper and a handful of figures. Yet, I still needed to distribute the work along a mini-cluster in the cloud, keep track of thousands of different experiments, track key performance metrics over time, and integrate a half-dozen datasets and a dozen models. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At that scale, it’s pretty easy to shoot yourself in the foot: introduce a data loading error that invalidates your results, forget to keep track of which parameters you used for which experiment you ran months ago, have a figure that’s not easily reproducible because the steps to reproduce the figure have been lost through the sands of time, etc. &lt;a href=&quot;https://paperswithcode.com/trends&quot;&gt;25% of papers in machine learning actually publish their code&lt;/a&gt;, and I have a feeling that a big chunk of the other 75% is because people hesitate to share their messy creations, or the code is so brittle that it self-destroys as soon as you see it and they don’t want to support it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s the stack that I used for this project, the reason I took some decisions, and some lessons I learned. I think that the organization I show here is appropriate for small research teams like academic labs and early-stage startups. Some of this is a little pedestrian, but I hope you learn a thing or two. Let me know about your experiences in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Decision points&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Local vs. cloud&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/&quot;&gt;Full Stack Deep Learning&lt;/a&gt; class from Berkeley is a good place to learn how to organize deep learning projects. I had originally intended to go all-in on cloud infra to run models and analyze data. The class makes a solid argument that it ends being cheaper to build your own machine for local testing, then scale on the cloud as needed. I had a several years old deep learning rig with a 1080 Titan lying around, so I ended up wiping the drive and installing Ubuntu 20 on it for local bleeding edge development. I would then push the code to github when the code was ready to be scaled and run on cloud infra. Having a local dev machine doesn’t mean you’re locked to that place: you can still set up remote ssh access, but given that it was winter and we were on lockdown I never had a reason to do it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I had spent far too many afternoons figuring out (and yelling at and crying about) kubernetes on Google Cloud last year, so for this project I decided to avoid managing cloud infra by using a managed on-demand service. I wanted a central server where I could submit a batch job and it would provision the right machine to run the job and store the results somewhere in the cloud. Importantly, I wanted it set up in a way that I wouldn’t have to pay for a central server, only for the workers. I ended up using &lt;strong&gt;paperspace gradient&lt;/strong&gt; for this purpose, which at the time, had cheap prices for GPU instances, and offered a straightforward product called &lt;em&gt;experiments&lt;/em&gt; which was meant for exactly the purpose I wanted. This setup worked great for the first 3 months, but then Gradient changed their product to focus on a more turnkey solution, and from that point on the original product stopped working properly (multiple jobs would hang, you couldn’t find jobs from the interface, customer support was abysmal). Next time, I will try &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/batch/&quot;&gt;AWS Batch&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps I will dip my toe into SageMaker to get access to a cloud jupyter notebook for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Code organization&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One unexpected advantage of using this hybrid local/cloud setup is that it immediately imposed a certain discipline on the project: gradient runs your code inside a &lt;strong&gt;docker&lt;/strong&gt; container, so you have to have a docker container ready, hence you are documenting your dependencies as you go along. I used the Pytorch docker container base and kept adding dependencies as needed, and used dockerhub to build the containers in the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This setup also imposes a workflow that focuses on creating batch jobs as Python scripts as opposed to jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks are great for analysis, but building models in jupyter notebook is a bad idea – you pollute your global namespace, you risk running cells out of order, the editor has poor introspection so won’t tell you if you reference a variable that doesn’t exist following a long script, etc. I much prefer writing models and batch scripts in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;VSCode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, using &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&quot;&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as an autoformatter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re used to a jupyter-notebook-based workflow, you’re probably used to writing small snippets of code, testing them in the cell on a handful of inputs, then lifting the code to a function which then you can integrate into the larger notebook narrative. With a batch-based workflow you lose this fast feedback process. The key to getting back that productivity – and then some – is to switch to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/testing.html&quot;&gt;test-driven development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Rather than informally testing snippets of your code in jupyter notebook, you create a separate test suite that calls the functions in your Python script and checks that their output is as expected. This forces you to write reasonably clean code with small functions that don’t have a lot of side effects. In practice, I didn’t aim for 100% code coverage, but instead focused on tests for data loaders and models. Testable code is also much easier to refactor, because you can easily see if you broke you code by re-running the test suite. Each test should only take a few milliseconds to run.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I enabled &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/about-continuous-integration&quot;&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt; (CI)&lt;/strong&gt; in the Github repo to run my pytest suite via nose2 every time I pushed code. Unfortunately, a lot of that code depended on having GPU access on Github, which would have become expensive, so I didn’t end up using it. It does look like it’s possible to run test suites on a GPU-enabled machine via &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/drelleobrien/how-to-use-github-actions-with-your-gpu-4f1g&quot;&gt;nvidia-docker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I used an ad-hoc project folder structure inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/index.html&quot;&gt;PyRSE&lt;/a&gt;. Elizabeth DuPre told me about cookiecutter, which allows one to create projects from templates. &lt;a href=&quot;https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/&quot;&gt;I ended up using the &lt;strong&gt;datascience cookiecutter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a subset of the project, and generally I liked it (although it is a bit too nested for my taste).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;TF vs. PyTorch&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ve used TF in the past, but I decided to use &lt;strong&gt;PyTorch&lt;/strong&gt; this round, since a lot of the models I wanted to test were released in PyTorch. The PyTorch documentation is excellent. A surprising chunk of my codebase ended up being training loops, so for next time I will consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/&quot;&gt;PyTorch Lightning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Storing results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One thing I never really spent time thinking about in grad school is how to store results. I have folders and folders in an old DropBox that are filled to the brim with mat files with long names from gosh knows what experiment. The problem with such ad hoc results storage is that you don’t know how the results were generated, because the results and the code are not linked. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you’d like to store results in a centralized location with the following features:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;each result comes with metadata about how the result was generated (command line parameters, git hash, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you can safely delete stale results&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you can query results to find the subet which you’re interested in&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you can visualize metadata about the results in graphical form (dashboard)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You could implement these functionalities yourself, for example with a local mongo database instance to store the results, and a dashboard of your creation, but I ended up instead using &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wandb.ai/&quot;&gt;Weights and Biases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (wandb). This turned out to be a great idea, highly recommended. In your code, you push your results along with metadata to their server using a simple library that you can pip install. The library takes care of adding the git hash to the payload so you know what code generated the result. You can also use the libary to send and store weights, images, checkpoints, etc. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7695&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7695&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-4&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;3026,1560&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-4-3/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Wandb dashboard&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You get a fully customizable dashboard built on vega-lite to keep track of your results. To retrieve your results, you use mongodb queries, so you can filter results by whatever property you desire. To have meaningful properties to query, I specify command line arguments to my training scripts via &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html&quot;&gt;argparse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, for instance number of filters, learning rate, epochs, etc. Then I send the argparse arguments to wandb when I save my results. That way I can easily filter by learning rate, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Locally, I do still use &lt;strong&gt;tensorboard&lt;/strong&gt; to babysit my networks, especially with a new network when it’s not clear whether the training will converge or not. I find that tensorboard is good to diagnose one model, but it’s not great to keep track of multiple models (say, more than 5) – pretty soon all you see is a mess of training curves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Analyzing results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;strong&gt;jupyterlab&lt;/strong&gt; locally to analyze my results. One thing that I don’t like about jupyter notebooks is that it doesn’t play well with git – the diffs are meaningless. I will try out &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext&quot;&gt;jupytext&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows to write jupyter notebooks as plain text. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Mistakes I made&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I accumulated a lot of technical debt around a seemingly innocuous decision about data storage. I downloaded brain data in ad hoc formats from multiple public sources (crcns), and I originally wrote a PyTorch data loader for each data source. That meant that for every new brain dataset I wanted to integrate, I would write a new data loader, which would take care of filtering out bad records, splitting the data into train and test set, and transforming it into the format that PyTorch expected. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That worked fine for the first 2 or 3 datasets, but pretty soon it became a liability. The ad-hoc formats were not always designed for rapid loading – some datasets were really slow to load because they used small block sizes in hdf5. Other datasets needed some manual curation. What I needed is an intermediate format – I would preprocess the datasets into the intermediate format once, and then load the intermediate format in the data loaders. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I should have done&lt;/strong&gt; is have one true intermediate format – e.g. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nwb.org/&quot;&gt;NWB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – I should also have decided train/test splits during the preprocessing. The data needed to be in a &lt;strong&gt;FAIR&lt;/strong&gt; format in the intermediate stage – it needed, especially to be interopable. What I ended up doing is having a bunch of ad hoc intermediate formats – I would minimally preprocess the data and save it in a format parallel to the original one. Ultimately, that meant having to make a lot of micro decisions (e.g. how do I specify the train/test splits – two datasets, or one dataset and two sets of indices?) that I made inconsistently across datasets, and it became a mess that I never bothered fixing. My test suite for loaders ballooned as I had to cover for corner cases for every loader. Doing it over again, I would find settle on one true intermediate format.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I experimented a bit with using &lt;strong&gt;make&lt;/strong&gt; to create the intermediate format, and I think it’s a great solution for this use case. make will create intermediate results if they don’t exist but won’t try to recreate them if they’re already there; an ideal solution to manage complex pipelines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Releasing code and models&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I didn’t really think much about making the code easy to run for others, but when it came time to release it (for reviewers), it only took me about a half day to clean up the codebase and write docs. The code was already logically organized, the dependencies documented, most everything ran automatically with bash scripts, so all in all it was much less trouble to release than a typical project I would have undertook in grad school. That being said, I would like to release the model in an easy-to-use way. It’s unfortunate that huggingface models are restricted to transformer models, that would have been ideal. I was recently made aware of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/replicate/cog&quot;&gt;cog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which aims to make model releases easy, complete with docker environment and downloadable weights. The weights themselves can be stored on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://figshare.com/&quot;&gt;figshare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (free bandwidth!)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Keep/change/try&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-table&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Keep&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Change&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Try (more)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pytorch&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Paperspace -&amp;gt; AWS batch&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Jupytext&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;wandb&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ad hoc intermediate format -&amp;gt; NWB&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Make&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mixed local/cloud development&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Google Cloud Storage -&amp;gt; S3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Data science cookie cutter&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;vscode&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;PyTorch Lightning&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Test-driven development&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;cog&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Black&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;SageMaker&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Docker&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Physically attractive people are routinely judged to be “superior” in other ways — to be more trustworthy, for example, and honest, and intelligent. However, evidence for the unwarranted “attractiveness halo” effect has tended to come from studies that have involved snap-judgements with no feedback or repercussions for the people doing the judging. Gayathri Pandey and Vivian Zayas at Cornell University, US, wanted to explore how this bias plays out in the longer term, when contradicted by actual data. If, say, we’re given information that an attractive investor is actually losing us money, while an unattractive investor is securing profits, surely we’ll quickly drop that bias in relation to these individual people at least? Alarmingly, the pair’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12495?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Psychology&lt;/em&gt; suggests not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42524&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an initial study, 91 students were each shown four photos of purported “financial partners” (all of the same gender). Two of the composite faces had independently been rated as attractive and two as unattractive. The students were given a hypothetical $2000 and told to make as much money as possible. Across 50 trials with all male partners and another 50 with all female partners, they had to click on a face to choose one with whom to invest the money, and each time, they got feedback as to whether they’d lost or gained money.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before they started, the students were informed that some of the partners would be more helpful than others. They were also encouraged to try them all, to find out which were better and which worse. What they were not told was that there were in fact two equally disadvantageous partners (who delivered some relatively large immediate gains but smaller long-term profits or even long-term losses) — one attractive and one unattractive — and two advantageous partners (who conferred better long-term profits), again, one attractive and one not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As expected, the students started out favouring the attractive partners. But even after receiving 50 trials’ worth of feedback about the performance of each individual, they were still swayed by attractiveness. In fact, they preferred the attractive-&lt;em&gt;disadvantageous&lt;/em&gt; partner over the unattractive-&lt;em&gt;advantageous &lt;/em&gt;partner. They also reported finding the attractive partners more helpful. (There was some evidence of improved performance in the second block of trials, though the team’s analysis suggests that this reflected better use of the feedback, rather than getting significantly better at discounting attractiveness.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps 50 trials weren’t enough for the participants to accurately discriminate between helpful vs unhelpful partners, and discount attractiveness, the researchers reasoned. So they ran another experiment, this time with 135 participants who each completed 100 trials (with either all male or all female partners).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results were different — but not drastically so. As the participants progressed through the 100 rounds of feedback, they did come to show a preference for the advantageous partners. However, after suffering a loss, they were still quicker to return to an attractive vs unattractive partner, and by the end, the attractive-disadvantageous partner was still &lt;em&gt;as popular&lt;/em&gt; a choice as the unattractive-advantageous one. “Even with more opportunity to learn about partners’ profitability, time did not appreciably moderate the effect of attractiveness,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The participants were asked afterwards about how trustworthy they perceived the four partners to be. The attractive two were clearly favoured. In fact, the researchers’ analysis suggests that a perceived association between attractiveness and trustworthiness explained the results — we seem to use attractiveness as a signal of trustworthiness, and rely on it, even in the face of financial losses (albeit hypothetical ones).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s possible of course that with more trials, which could provide a clearer picture of trends in financial gains and losses, the attractiveness bias would have been eliminated. Only further research will tell. And as the researchers themselves note, a study that involved American college students, just White faces and hypothetical rather than real money is only a starting point for research in this area, rather than the final word. However, the new work certainly does suggest that the attractiveness halo colours our judgements, at a cost to ourselves, for far longer than might have been assumed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12495?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;What is a face worth? Facial attractiveness biases experience-based monetary decision-making&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>tag:ocns.github.io,2021-06-09:/SoftwareWG/2021/06/09/software-wg-tutorials-at-cns-2021-online-bash-git-and-python.html</id>
		<updated>2021-06-09T09:47:23+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The Software Working Group is holding three beginner level tutorials at the upcoming &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CNS&lt;/span&gt;*2021 Online conference. These will cover using the command line (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/&quot;&gt;Bash&lt;/a&gt;), using &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://git-scm.com&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, and development in the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://python.org&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To attend these, and other tutorials at &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2021&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CNS&lt;/span&gt;*2021&lt;/a&gt;, please register for the conference &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2021-registration-fees&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;effective-use-of-bash&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Effective use of Bash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructor(s): Felix B. Kern (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/kernfel&quot;&gt;@kernfel&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce participants to the tools they need in order to comfortably and confidently work with a Unix/Linux command line terminal.
Unlike graphical user interfaces, which are often self-explanatory or have obvious built-in help options, the purely text-based nature of a command line terminal can be intimidating and confusing to novice users.
Yet, once mastered, the command line offers more flexibility and smoother workflows for many tasks, while being entirely irreplaceable for things such as cluster access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we aim to introduce participants to the concepts and tools they need to confidently operate within a Unix/Linux command line environment.
In particular, the tutorial is developed for Bash (as per the title), which should cover most Linux and MacOS* use cases.
We hope to provide participants with a firm understanding of the basics of using a shell, as well as an understanding of the advantages of working from a command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutorial is aimed not only at novices who have rarely or never used a command line, but also at occasional or even regular users of bash who seek to expand or refresh their repertoire of everyday commands and the kinds of quality-of-life tricks and shortcuts that are rarely covered on StackExchange questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* While MacOS has switched from &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt; as its default shell, &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quo&quot;&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;s operation is sufficiently similar for the purposes of this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A working copy of bash; participants on Linux and MacOS are all set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants on Windows have several options to get hold of a bash environment without leaving familiar territory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gitforwindows.org/&quot;&gt;Git for Windows&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a Git Bash emulation with most of the standard tools you might expect in a Linux/Unix environment, plus of course Git.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternatively, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux&quot;&gt;enable &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WSL2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6&quot;&gt;install Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; as a virtual machine hosted by Windows. Somewhat ironically, this requires at least one use of a command line terminal (though not bash); on the upside, the Linux-on-Windows experience can be a smooth and safe first step into Linux territory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basics to refer back to: Operating your bash shell (with key bindings and patience)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The grammar of a shell command line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting around: navigating within and beyond your computer: &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pwd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pushd&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;popd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeing what’s there: &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;, globbing, and strategies for naming your files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File system manipulations: &lt;code&gt;mv&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cp&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rmdir&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ln -s&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;touch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking into files: &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;amp&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;more&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;diff&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text manipulation: &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;uniq&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cut&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;column&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Putting things together: piping and redirection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to do when stuck: &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt;, I need some &lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt; here &lt;code&gt;apropos&lt;/code&gt; of this command…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;effective-use-of-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Effective use of Git&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructor(s): Ankur Sinha (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/sanjayankur31&quot;&gt;@sanjayankur31&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version control is a necessary skill that users writing any amount of code should possess.
Git is a popular version control tool that is used ubiquitously in software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hands-on session is aimed at beginners who have little or no experience with version control systems and Git.
It will introduce the basics of version control and walk through a common daily Git workflow before moving on to show how Git is used for collaborative development on popular Git forges such as GitHub.
Finally, it will show some advanced features of Git that aid in debugging code errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session is intended to be a hands-on session, so all attendees will be expected to run Git commands.
A working installation of Git is, therefore, required for this session.
We will use GitHub as our Git remote for forking and pull/merge requests.
So a GitHub account will also be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux users can generally install Git from their default package manager:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fedora:&lt;code&gt;sudo dnf install git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu:&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows users should use &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gitforwindows.org/&quot;&gt;Git for Windows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MacOS users should use &lt;code&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt; to install &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;brew install git&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information on installing Git can be found on the project website: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;https://git-scm.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a brief introduction to Git&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;references, options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where to get help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using Git on a daily basis:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating a new repository &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adding files and staging files: &lt;code&gt;add, add -i&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ignoring files: &lt;code&gt;.gitingore&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stashing: &lt;code&gt;stash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;viewing changes: &lt;code&gt;diff, log&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;committing files: &lt;code&gt;commit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using branches to organise the development workflow: &lt;code&gt;branch, checkout&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tagging: &lt;code&gt;tag&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating an archive: &lt;code&gt;archive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using Git for collaborative development&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remotes, forks: &lt;code&gt;remote&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pushing and pulling: &lt;code&gt;push, pull&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pull requests and merging: &lt;code&gt;merge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;merge conflicts and resolving them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slightly advanced git&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Git worktrees: &lt;code&gt;worktree&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interactive rebasing: &lt;code&gt;rebase -i&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cherry-picking: &lt;code&gt;cherry-pick&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debugging with git-bisect: &lt;code&gt;bisect&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;python-for-beginners&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python for beginners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructors: Joe Graham (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/joewgraham&quot;&gt;@joewgraham&lt;/a&gt;), Shailesh Appukuttan (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/appukuttan-shailesh&quot;&gt;@appukuttan-shailesh&lt;/a&gt;), Ankur Sinha (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/sanjayankur31&quot;&gt;@sanjayankur31&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is amongst the most widely used programming languages today, and is increasingly popular in the scientific domain.
A large number of tools and simulators in use currently are either implemented in Python, or offer interfaces for their use via Python.
Python programming is therefore a very sought after skill in the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial is targeted towards people who have some experience with programming languages (e.g. &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MATLAB&lt;/span&gt;, C, C++, etc), but are relatively new to Python.
It is structured to have you quickly up-and-running, giving you a feel of how things work in Python.
We shall begin by demonstrating how to setup and manage virtual environments on your system, to help you keep multiple projects isolated.
We’ll show you how to install Python packages in virtual environments and how to manage them.
This will be followed by a quick overview of very basic Python constructs, leading finally to a neuroscience-themed project that will give you the opportunity to bring together various programming concepts with some hands-on practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shell (participants on Linux and MacOS are all set; see below for Windows users)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python 3.6.9 or higher (see below for info on installation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants on Windows have several options to get hold of a shell environment without leaving familiar territory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gitforwindows.org/&quot;&gt;Git for Windows&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a Git Bash emulation with most of the standard tools you might expect in a Linux/Unix environment, plus of course Git.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternatively, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux&quot;&gt;enable &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WSL2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6&quot;&gt;install Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; as a virtual machine hosted by Windows. This Linux-on-Windows experience can be a smooth and safe first step into Linux territory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find several resources online for info on installing Python. e.g. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://realpython.com/installing-python/&quot;&gt;https://realpython.com/installing-python/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up and managing virtual environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing packages using PyPI (&lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;) and from Git repositories (e.g. GitHub)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick Python 101 - lists, dicts, if…else, loops, functions, error handling, import, help, numpy, matplotlib&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short neuroscience-themed project - modularizing the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good practices - lint (Flake8)&lt;/li&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The University of Cape Town (UCT) in South Africa is in a prime location to conduct oceanographic research and features a wealth of scientific expertise. However, as in many institutions, the pool of oceanographic researchers can be quite homogenous. UCT researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://katyealtieri.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Katye Altieri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Fawcett&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sarah Fawcett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maris.uct.ac.za/ma-re/members/academic/ansorge&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Isabelle Ansorge&lt;/a&gt; realized that while the academic staff in the Department of Oceanography at UCT is comprised of ~50% womxn, it is 100% white. Furthermore, in 2019, amongst postgraduates in the department, there were only 12 Black African and Coloured South African womxn out of 73 students. The barriers that prevent higher representation of Black womxn in oceanography and climate science are numerous and include financial restrictions and lack of resources or training opportunities. The feeling of ‘otherness’ can also prevent Black womxn from feeling like a part of the research community. Altieri says that she and her colleagues saw an opportunity to create “a dedicated programme that offers field work preparation, mentorship and support for black womxn so they can become future leaders of oceanography in South Africa and the global south”. The three womxn joined forces with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saeon.ac.za/enewsleter-archives/2011/february2011/doc05&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Juliet Hermes&lt;/a&gt; from the South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON), and they decided to apply for a grant from the Advancing Womxn initiative, created by UCT Vice-Chancellor Professor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamokgethi_Phakeng&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mamokgethi Phakeng.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result is &lt;a href=&quot;https://oceanwomxn.co.za/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ocean Womxn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a program funded for an 5 year initial period, that aims to remove barriers and provide support for Black womxn in oceanography. In the first year, 5 womxn joined the program, with 2 more following in 2021. The Fellows receive comprehensive support – this includes financial cover for the duration of their degree, relocation costs, field gear budget and a laptop. They also have sea-going opportunities, such as SEAmester cruises, where they can develop lab skills and receive hands-on experience. Additionally, they are offered the option of swimming, boating and scuba lessons. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS ONE recently spoke with some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oceanwomxn.co.za/cohort-2020&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ocean Womxn Fellows&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about the program and how it has impacted their journey as early career oceanographers. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Doctoral training programs and fellowships often provide valuable resources and opportunities for PhD candidates. What opportunities have you had as an Ocean Womxn Fellow that you might not have otherwise had as a general PhD student? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith:&lt;/strong&gt; I would definitely say the emotional and moral support by being in a cohort. Also, the mentor sessions with other women and role models in STEM fields. An added opportunity is definitely the exposure that we get on social media and all over for changing the landscape for black womxn in Oceanography. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kolisa:&lt;/strong&gt; My most memorable and unique opportunities that I am receiving through Ocean Womxn are networking with influential women in the world of STEM. Every month we have visiting mentors ranging from women Professors to women PhD candidates who are making waves in their industries and fields of expertise. This is unique to Ocean Womxn as no other fellowship does this in our department. From these face-to-face interactions we get to ask whatever questions we want answered by the invited mentor. This has largely enriched not just my thinking, but I have formed relationships with some of our guests and have been recommended for opportunities by some.&lt;em&gt;  &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Researchers from under-represented groups/communities often experience a “burden of service”, whereby they are asked to do more outreach and engagement activities than their colleagues. This can take time away from doing actual research. Have you ever previously experienced this, and how has the Ocean Womxn program helped you to avoid being in this situation? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith:&lt;/strong&gt; For me the outreach and engagement activities are not a “burden of service”, but rather an act of love and kindness to reach out to other under-represented groups. The support that I experienced through the Ocean Womxn program inspired me to support other young womxn in STEM research fields. I got involved in the Project Kuongoza Mentorship program as a mentor to mentees across Africa and am now “serving” my continent outside the borders of the country! I believe that you need to have a balance in life and sharing about your experiences in research should be seen as part of enriching your life. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kolisa: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes, I have experienced this. More so because I am a well-known science communicator and so in addition to having the responsibility of “burden of service” I have the responsibility to “teach” science to the masses. Ocean Womxn has enhanced this and for me it really is not a burden but a privilege. I see it as a privilege because I get to be an underrepresented group representative doing the service so well, encouraging others to follow in my footsteps and see that it is possible. It is key for me to be this type of scientist because I did not have this as I grew up in a world where I had no black women ocean scientists to look up to. Ocean Womxn has magnified my role as a role model in not just ocean sciences but in science at large. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; What is the most memorable fieldwork or laboratory experience you have had so far? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith:&lt;/strong&gt; I was involved in the First European-South African Transmission Experiment which was an international collaboration between Germany, Netherlands, Norway, and South Africa. It was a huge challenge and honour for me to be responsible for the data acquisition, analysis, storage, and maintenance of the aerosol equipment. It also led to me doing my PhD! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kolisa:&lt;/strong&gt; My most memorable fieldwork to date is being part of the Prince Edward Island sampling expedition for my PhD. On the expedition we sailed to the subantarctic Southern Ocean on the SA Agulhas II which is South Africa’s research vessel. I spent about 2 and half months in the middle of the ocean living though sea storms and calm waters. It was my first experience out that far into the open ocean. I returned to land as a new woman. I was transformed mentally and had this urge to change the world with my science and I believe that is exactly what I am currently doing. I wanted to make academia and science inclusive, especially for black women! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Your research focuses on understanding the impacts of climate change. How did you become interested in this field?  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith:&lt;/strong&gt; My research on atmospheric aerosols, and more specifically sea spray aerosols, seeks to address the uncertainty about the drivers of climate change. As sea spray aerosols occur naturally in the atmosphere, it can be used as a proxy for pre-industrial conditions and to determine how anthropogenic activities contributed to climate change. I am a Physicist and was involved in characterizing atmospheric effects over the ocean on visual and infrared cameras, when it became apparent that aerosols (microscopic particles) play a huge role in the atmosphere. I then decided to do my PhD atmospheric aerosols to improve the understanding and inputs of aerosols to prediction models of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kolisa: &lt;/strong&gt;Our planet is changing as we know it and our role as scientists is key in uncovering the shifts. As science majors we always heard, read about, and were constantly reminded of global warming which leads to climate change. This sparks interest in many of us to want to uncover and dissect the intricacies of how this happens, how it affects our planet and what we need to do to mitigate it. Therefore, my interests I can say were sparked long before I even knew I would take my research focuses this far into academia. I wanted to be one of the first and few black women scientists from Africa who are part of this global research to understand our planet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; More and more researchers are committing to the mission of Open Science: to making the entire research process openly accessible, transparent, and reproducible. Examples of this include publishing in open access journals, preregistering research plans, publishing protocols, as well as sharing data and code. What are your thoughts on Open Science and how do you feel this kind of improved transparency, accessibility and equity impacts scientific research? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith:&lt;/strong&gt; I am all for Open Science! It was such a relief when articles that were previously behind the paywall became available due to the pandemic. I think that scientific research will now reach higher heights and swifter turnarounds with more diverse collaborations. The Covid-19 vaccine rollouts is a sterling example of how the “openness” of scientific science can contribute to quicker implementations and finding solutions for all. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kolisa:&lt;/strong&gt; I personally have chosen the path of science communication to merge with my research because I support open science. Open science starts with transparency, inclusivity and being accommodative. When our science is openly accessible and well understood we achieve more with our discoveries. The aim of us doing science is to understand how systems work and report on those. These reports are in forms of difficult journal papers that take a lot to understand. I believe that we need to evolve with the times and make our science open and easily understandable by anyone who reads our findings and recommendations. How will the world improve, and people be educated if we do not articulate ourselves strategically to be open and transparent about our data, our research plans and our publishing and communication? &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having a new baby is never easy: it’s difficult to manage the stress of birth, sleepless nights, and juggling of childcare and domestic responsibilities, especially for first-time parents. Some also experience postnatal depression, which is estimated to affect 23% of women in Europe after the birth of a child (men also experience postnatal depression, though the numbers are not so clear).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add to new parenting the impact of lockdown, and that figure could rise sharply, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648002/full&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt; suggests. Working with women with babies aged six months or younger in the UK during the first COVID-19 lockdown, UCL’s Sarah Myers and Emily H. Emmott found that almost half met the threshold for postnatal depression — double the average European rates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42503&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were 162 London-based women aged between 19 and 47 years old; half were first-time mothers, while the other half had up to three other children. Women first filled in a survey which measured symptoms of postnatal depression, then shared their own personal social networks, listing up to 25 people and explaining who they were and what the relationship was.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After sharing this information, participants also reported who in this network they had seen in person and who they had chatted with on the phone, via video call, or by text or WhatsApp over the last few weeks. Contacts included family, old friends, colleagues and so-called “mummy friends” — non-family female friends who also had children of the same age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results showed high levels of depressive symptoms among the new mothers, with 47.5% reporting symptoms that met the threshold of diagnosis of postnatal depression (34.6% of the group reported particularly high levels of symptoms).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In terms of social networks, participants (like many non-parents) saw few people during the weeks leading up to the survey. On average, women had seen one family member, three other general friends, and no “mummy friends”, though they were speaking to many different social contacts via social media, phone call or text. Many women were going without support from family members, however — 47.5% had seen no relatives at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Social contact was also linked to depressive symptoms: the more social contacts participants saw in person, the less likely they were to report symptoms of postnatal depression, suggesting a link between social isolation and depression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also explored the experience of new parenthood during lockdown through open-ended questions about how the pandemic had affected mothers’ self-esteem and their relationships with their babies. Some mothers felt positively about lockdown, stating that it had given them more quality time with their baby and an increase in time partners were home and able to help with childcare. “It has been a great help having my partner home every day as it means most days I can get at least an hour to myself which I use to exercise or catch up on sleep,” one woman wrote. “Also I think it has been an amazing positive on my partner’s ability to build a bond with the baby and co-parent.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, in concordance with the high levels of depressive symptoms, other mothers struggled. Some felt a “constant burden” of parenting (“I think lockdown has made me feel like I’m not a person in my own right anymore, just a mum”), while others pointed to the relative inadequacy of online support. One woman pointed to the many video calls and chats she had during this period — but noted that the physical isolation of lockdown led to a lack of practical advice and support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, others saw lockdown as a time of “lost opportunities”. “You’re only a first time mum once, and I was really looking forward to this time and making new mum friends,” one woman wrote. “I think I am most sad about missing out on that.” Others pointed to worries about development — concerns about whether children would recognise family members having only met them on FaceTime, missing physical and mental milestones, and lack of play with other children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team points to two key insights: firstly, that it “takes a village” to raise a child, with social networks crucial to supporting both parents and babies in the time after birth; and secondly, that the impact of COVID-19 on new parents should be considered in healthcare interventions, with key focus on face-to-face, rather than digital, support from health and social care services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study highlights the unique (and incredibly stressful) circumstances into which new parents were thrust during the COVID-19 pandemic — and now that lockdown has eased, the results suggest, it may be an opportune time to reach out to new parents in your own social networks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648002/full&quot;&gt;Communication Across Maternal Social Networks During England’s First National Lockdown and Its Association With Postnatal Depressive Symptoms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remote focusing is widely used in 3D two-photon microscopy and 3D photostimulation because it enables fast axial scanning without moving the objective lens or specimen. However, due to the design constraints of microscope optics, remote focus units are often located in non-telecentric positions in the optical path, leading to significant depth-dependent 3D field distortions in the imaging volume. To address this limitation, we characterized 3D field distortions arising from non-telecentric remote focusing and present a method for distortion precompensation. We demonstrate its applicability for a 3D two-photon microscope that uses an acousto-optic lens (AOL) for remote focusing and scanning. We show that the distortion precompensation method improves the pointing precision of the AOL microscope to &amp;lt; 0.5 µm throughout the 400 × 400 × 400 µm imaging volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory neurons orchestrate the activity of excitatory neurons and play key roles in circuit function. Although individual interneurons have been studied extensively, little is known about their properties at the population level. Using random-access 3D two-photon microscopy, we imaged local populations of cerebellar Golgi cells (GoCs), which deliver inhibition to granule cells. We show that population activity is organized into multiple modes during spontaneous behaviors. A slow, network-wide common modulation of GoC activity correlates with the level of whisking and locomotion, while faster (&amp;lt;1 s) differential population activity, arising from spatially mixed heterogeneous GoC responses, encodes more precise information. A biologically detailed GoC circuit model reproduced the common population mode and the dimensionality observed experimentally, but these properties disappeared when electrical coupling was removed. Our results establish that local GoC circuits exhibit multidimensional activity patterns that could be used for inhibition-mediated adaptive gain control and spatiotemporal patterning of downstream granule cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where were you at 8am two Tuesdays ago? If it’s a little tricky to recall, what if I presented you with a map with four location flags to choose from, each about 3-4 km apart, with one marking your actual location on that time and date?  Are you confident that you’d pick the right one?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; confident, the good news from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620980752&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; is that you’re more likely to be right than if you’re not too sure. The bad news is that when a group of students in Melbourne, Australia was tested in this way, they picked the wrong location 36% of the time. The study shows that this type of memory is pretty fallible — and yet it’s the type, of course, that’s needed for a criminal alibi. Failures in recalling where you were have no doubt contributed to serious miscarriages of justice, write Elizabeth Laliberte at the University of Melbourne and her colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42494&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 51 students all downloaded onto their phones an app that had been developed by two of the researchers. Over a four week period, this app continuously tracked their movement and orientation, and also took GPS location and audio snapshots every ten minutes. Software stripped any speech from these audio files, but preserved background noise, such as birdsong or building work. (The app was designed to keep raw participant data confidential from even the researchers, and the participants were able to pause data collection for periods.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After a week’s delay, the participants were tested, again via the app. For each of 72 trials, they had to pick where they were on a specific time and date from four markers on a Google map. (They were able to zoom in and out and pan as they pleased). One of these markers represented the correct location, and the other three represented places they’d been on other occasions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team’s analysis revealed that, as a group, the students were correct only about two-thirds of the time. Accuracy did increase with confidence, a finding that supports the idea that (under certain circumstances) &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/08/public-belief-in-memory-myths-not-actually-that-widespread-study-argues/&quot;&gt;greater confidence is linked to better memory&lt;/a&gt;. But the far from perfect performance of these university students, with presumably fairly regular schedules, doesn’t bode well for the rest of us — especially people without regular office hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team highlights the case of American man Ronald Cotton, who in 1985 was convicted on charges of rape and burglary and sentenced to life plus 50 years in prison. Ten years after the conviction, DNA evidence exonerated him. Cotton’s initial defence had not been helped when his alibi had been shown to be false. “Rather than report where he’d been at the time of the crime, Cotton mistakenly recalled where he had been the week before. The error probably contributed significantly to his wrongful conviction,” the researchers write.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team’s analysis suggests that this error is relatively common: choosing a “right-day, wrong-week” location accounted for 19% of their participants’ errors. Participants also frequently chose a location that matched the stipulated hour but got the day wrong — this error accounted for 8% of the mistakes. (They also sometimes picked an incorrect location in which they had made similar patterns of movement or where the background sounds were similar to the correct location — though these errors were less common). “Both of these figures are well above chance rates and suggest that the error that Ronald Cotton made might be quite common,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the findings could have practical, legal applications. Knowing just how fallible this type of alibi memory is — and understanding the most common errors that people make — could help lawyers to ask the right questions of defendants and witnesses, to try to get closer to the truth of where someone really was at a certain time.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there are more general implications for understanding memory, and for the way that memory research is done. Experiments are often lab-based, raising questions about real-world applicability. Passive, unobtrusive, privacy-conscious monitoring technologies like this new app could be used to gather and analyse all kinds of real-world data. As the researchers write, “We are now able to capture the ground truth of people’s lives and to test their ability to retain those events.” And this, they hope, could change how a good deal of memory research is done.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620980752&quot;&gt;The Fallacy of an Airtight Alibi: Understanding Human Memory for “Where” Using Experience Sampling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep researchers often takes a “brain-centric” approach to their work, measuring sleep stages using EEG, for instance, or examining how sleep affects learning and memory&lt;/strong&gt;. Yet rudimentary creatures also sleep — including the hydra, an aquatic organism which has a basic nervous system but no brain at all.  The findings suggest that our primitive ancestors slept before they even evolved brains, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/sleep-evolved-before-brains-hydras-are-living-proof/&quot;&gt;writes Veronique Greenwood&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42478&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In his recent testimony to a House of Commons committee, Dominic Cummings blamed “groupthink” for various failures by the government to adequately tackle the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/strong&gt;But at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/02/covid-mistakes-groupthink-government-dominic-cummings&quot;&gt;psychologists Stephen Reicher and John Drury explain&lt;/a&gt; that the concept of groupthink is “highly contested”, and doesn’t really reflect how groups actually make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When in our history did humans learn to count — and did our Neanderthal cousins also have a system for noting numerical information? &lt;/strong&gt;Colin Barras &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01429-6&quot;&gt;explores the possibilities&lt;/a&gt; in a fascinating feature at &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a recent paper, researchers report performing magic tricks for a very unusual audience: Eurasian jays. &lt;/strong&gt;The birds fell for just one of the three different sleight-of-hand tricks, while humans were tricked by all three. The jays’ apparent resistance to the tricks could reflect the fact they don’t have the same expectations as humans about hand movements, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/we-performed-magic-tricks-on-birds-to-see-how-they-perceive-the-world-161772&quot;&gt;writes researcher Elias Garcia-Pelegrin&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be wary of articles telling you how to “boost your dopamine levels” to achieve happiness. &lt;/strong&gt;The associations between our neurotransmitter levels and emotional states are much more complicated than those kinds of headlines suggest, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyche.co/ideas/the-fascinating-science-of-pleasure-goes-way-beyond-dopamine&quot;&gt;explains Dean Burnett&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Psyche&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who overestimate their media literacy skills are also more likely to view and share fake news. &lt;/strong&gt;The effects are fairly small, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/dunning-kruger-meets-fake-news/&quot;&gt;reports John Timmer at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but are consistent with other work on the Dunning-Kruger effect (and similar to another paper we covered in March, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/05/it-turns-out-you-can-bullshit-a-bullshitter-after-all/&quot;&gt;which found a “bullshit blindspot”&lt;/a&gt; among people who were overconfident in their own intellectual abilities).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Puppies have a natural capacity to understand human attempts at communication, according to a new study. &lt;/strong&gt;The team found that Golden Retrievers and Labradors were pretty good at responding to pointing and baby talk at just 8 weeks old, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2279726-puppies-are-born-with-the-genetic-ability-to-understand-humans/&quot;&gt;reports Christa Lesté-Lasserre&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;. These abilities seem to have a substantial genetic component, which makes sense given that humans have bred dogs to be social.&lt;/p&gt;

 Tips for making open access books

We look at six different ways that academic authors at Leiden University have found to make their books open access, and pass on their tips.

More and more academic books are published as Open Access (OA) making them freely available to read without any payment being necessary. The Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) already includes more than 42,000 peer-reviewed OA books from around 500 publishers worldwide. These books are integrated into most library catalogues. Research funders increasingly demand that output produced as a result of their funding, and which is published in books, should be published as OA. It is expected that in the future, more and more academics will publish their book OA as a lot of publishers are willing to publish books immediately OA.

In this blog post the Open Access Team from the Centre for Digital Scholarship, Leiden University Libraries, interviewed some Leiden academics about how they went about publishing their books OA. These interviews show what you can do to publish a book OA, and also how you can make a book that is already published accessible by open access. The examples are in no particular order.</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/PPI_Picscout_OAFI-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think of patients as naïve when seeking help and support, then you are seeing only one part of the picture. Increasingly in the past decade, patients are moving from being “users and choosers” to “makers and shapers”, thus challenging the classic caregiver paradigm. In the paternalistic model of medicine, health professionals appear like parents who impart the best treatment to patients without seeking their opinions in the process. However, owing to an increase in the literacy of patients and moral concerns of the patients’ “right to know”, progress is being made in recognizing the importance of patients’ values and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients live with their conditions every day and are the experts of them. This knowledge should be welcomed and valued throughout the process of care, as well as in the design and implementation of research studies by engaging patients in science. Patients with a scientific background, patients with chronic diseases that are experts of their condition, and those who have recovered from disease may be able to support others in dealing with their disease as well as researchers in the development and design of clinical studies. Knowing what patients want and how they want it is essential to improving the effectiveness of clinical research and consequent societal benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients live with their conditions every day and are the experts of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-12411&quot; height=&quot;553&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/shutterstock_600015697844.jpg&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What exactly is Patient and Public Involvement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Patient and public involvement (PPI) is essentially the research being carried out by researchers alongside members of the public rather than to, about, or for them. Patients have acquired decision-making power through the change of the medical and social paradigm and becoming more active at the time of seeking information around therapeutic options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent developments require investigators to involve the public as part of any prospective reseach and subsequently inform about study’s results. That is if they wish to successfully obtain research funding. Certain types of health research, such as participatory action studies with qualitative methods, mixed-methods studies, validation of questionnaires, Delphi studies, and development of clinical practice guidelines, actively encourage or necessitate patient involvement. On the other side, original research or literature reviews rarely involve patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the era of social media and enhanced connectivity, patients are coming together and patients’ organizations are becoming a reality. This can facilitate support and understanding or, importantly recognize the feelings of being a person suffering from a disease. Patients’ organizations recognize the willingness of patients with a severe chronic condition, such as osteoarthritis, to be involved in public health programs, clinical research, and trials. These partners continuously seek information to be up to date on everything related to their daily life struggles: the disease and its symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can publishers advance public engagement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What science is doing for me? Or How can I contribute with my insights? are two frequent questions in the mind of patients. Still, answering this can be complex as verifying scientific data and accessing the latest publications is challenging for most lay people. Science does not often speak a patient-friendly language, and partner organizations are working to bridge the gap between patients and the scientific community by being the translators between these two worlds. The publishing community has started to recognize its responsibility in delivering and facilitating access to its discoveries to patients and the general public. In this context, journals can play a key role in reducing scientific language barriers by allowing patients and the public to contribute and author publishable &lt;strong&gt;“Patients perspectives”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patient and public involvement (PPI) is essentially the research being carried out by researchers alongside members of the public rather than to, about, or for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several other strategies could be implemented in peer-review journals to welcome patients on board during the publication process and ensure patient-friendly access to information. Some examples could include inviting published authors &lt;strong&gt;to write a lay summary&lt;/strong&gt; of their work (in one or more languages), &lt;strong&gt;a patient information note&lt;/strong&gt;, and/or &lt;strong&gt;depict an infographic&lt;/strong&gt; to make it easily accessible to the general public. These can provide practical advice for patients based on the available evidence for the screening, assessment, and management of specific diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, submission guidelines could be implemented to help discern the studies complying with PPI guidelines, such as mandating &lt;strong&gt;the inclusion of the GRIPP-2 checklist&lt;/strong&gt;. This requirement would help to understand how the participation of patients would improve these studies’ results compared to those studies without their involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11117&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-11117&quot; height=&quot;296&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/Conference-1024x473.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Conference session advocating increased patient participation in EULAR’s work.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new normal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Innovations like creating and training&lt;strong&gt; a pool of engaged patient reviewers&lt;/strong&gt; to better understand their points of view and needs for submitted manuscripts which were hard to imagine a decade ago, could represent a revolution for the patients and the scientific community. Scientific articles presenting studies designed and conducted by patients to support patients are already a reality. In the last two years, the Osteoarthritis Patients Task Force which includes this blog’s author, a global alliance of patient organizations fighting against osteoarthritis, led by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oafifoundation.com/en/foundation/&quot;&gt;Osteoarthritis Foundation International (OAFI)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arthritis.org/&quot;&gt;Arthritis Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the results of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-019-2895-3&quot;&gt;a systematic review&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-020-03741-0&quot;&gt;a global survey&lt;/a&gt; analyzing patients with osteoarthritis’ perceptions of quality of life and associated factors. Both contribute in raising awareness of patients’ conditions and perspectives in a rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have entered an era of patient centricity, perspective, independence and auto-responsibility. There is still a long road ahead to go but we have already walked the first steps on it. If patients’ organizations and the editorial board of international journals join their efforts to give the perspectives of patients more visibility, then groundbreaking transformations can happen in health research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abstract for the talk is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large-scale numerical simulations of brain circuit models are important for identifying hypotheses on brain functions and testing their consistency and plausibility.
Similarly, spiking neural networks are also gaining traction in machine learning with the promise that neuromorphic hardware will eventually make them much more energy efficient than classical ANNs.
In this dev session, we will present the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt;-enhanced Neuronal Networks) framework [1], which aims to facilitate the use of graphics accelerators for computational models of large-scale spiking neuronal networks to address the challenge of efficient simulations.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; is an open source library that generates code to accelerate the execution of network simulations on &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NVIDIA&lt;/span&gt; GPUs through a flexible and extensible interface, which does not require in-depth technical knowledge from the users.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; was originally developed as a pure C++ and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/technologies/cuda/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUDA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; library but, subsequently, we have added a Python interface and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.khronos.org/opencl/&quot;&gt;OpenCL&lt;/a&gt; backend.
The Python interface has enabled us to develop a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/&quot;&gt;PyNN&lt;/a&gt; [2] frontend and we are also working on a Keras-inspired frontend for spike-based machine learning [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the session we will briefly cover the history and basic philosophy of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; and show some simple examples of how it is used and how it works inside.
We will then talk in more depth about its development with a focus on testing for &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt; dependent software and some of the further developments such as Brian2GeNN [4].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is an initiative to provide a ready to use Fedora based Free/Open source software platform for neuroscience.
We believe that similar to Free software, science should be free for all to use, share, modify, and study.
The use of Free software also aids reproducibility, data sharing, and collaboration in the research community.
By making the tools used in the scientific process easier to use, NeuroFedora aims to take a step to enable this ideal.
In this session, I will talk about the deliverables of the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; project and then go over the complete pipeline that we use to produce, test, and disseminate them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

It provides researchers with the means to express any kind of neural model in mathematical notation and takes care of translating these model descriptions into efficient executable code.
During this dev session I will first give a quick introduction to the simulator itself and its code generation mechanism.
I will then walk through Brian’s code structure, our automatic systems for tests and documentation, and demonstrate how we work on its development.
The Brian simulator welcome contributions on many levels, hopefully this dev session will give you an idea where to start.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The abstract for the talk is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurolib-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;neurolib&lt;/a&gt; is a computational framework for whole-brain modelling written in Python.
It provides a set of neural mass models that represent the average activity of a brain region on a mesoscopic scale.
In a whole-brain network model, brain regions are connected with each other based on structural connectivity data, i.e. the connectome of the brain.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurolib-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;neurolib&lt;/a&gt; can load structural and functional data sets, set up a whole-brain model, manage its parameters, simulate it, and organize its outputs for later analysis.
The activity of each brain region can be converted into a simulated &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BOLD&lt;/span&gt; signal in order to calibrate the model to empirical data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
Extensive model analysis is possible using a parameter exploration module, which allows to characterize the model’s behaviour given a set of changing parameters.
An optimization module allows for fitting a model to multimodal empirical data using an evolutionary algorithm.
Besides its included functionality, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurolib-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;neurolib&lt;/a&gt; is designed to be extendable such that custom neural mass models can be implemented easily.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurolib-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;neurolib&lt;/a&gt; offers a versatile platform for computational neuroscientists for prototyping models, managing large numerical experiments, studying the structure-function relationship of brain networks, and for in-silico optimization of whole-brain models.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/e-cigarette-1301664_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the Tobacco Policy Review Group published &lt;em&gt;Tobacco Free Ireland&lt;/em&gt;, a report which set a target for Ireland to reduce smoking prevalence to less than 5% by 2025. The report identified tobacco-related harm reduction as a key issue for consideration. Since e-cigarettes’ launch in the European Union (EU) in 2006 and in the United States of America (USA) in 2007, research on their potential benefits in terms of tobacco-related harm reduction, and on the public health harms of e-cigarettes, has grown. The systematic evidence review reported in this piece outlines what is known to date about using e-cigarette and initiation of smoking tobacco cigarettes among teenagers. There are two sister reviews: the first maps the harms and benefits of e-cigarettes [McCarthy 2020] and the second presents a systematic review of e-cigarettes role in smoking cessation [Quigley 2020]. These reviews are one of the inputs to the Irish governments policy and clinical guidelines on e-cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-10935-1&quot;&gt;Our systematic review&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; found that e-cigarette use among teenagers in Europe and North America was associated with starting tobacco cigarette smoking. Based on nine primary studies’ adjusted odds ratios, our meta-analysis calculated a three to six times higher odds of starting tobacco cigarette smoking for teenagers who had ever used e-cigarettes at baseline. These findings identify an important health-related harm and are supported by four other systematic reviews. [Soneji 2017; Glasser 2019; Khouja 2019; Aladeokin and Haighton 2019] Three of these reviews were among young adults [Soneji 2017; Glasser 2019; Khouja 2019] and one was in teenagers living in the UK [Aladeokin and Haighton 2019]. These findings are important because the prevalence of e-cigarette use is increasing in Europe and North America. For example, the prevalence of e-cigarette use among teenagers in the USA increased from 1.5% in 2011 to 20.8% in 2018 [Cullen 2018] and in Ireland ever use is 22% [Költő 2020]. Additionally, there is a danger that society will not be able to protect achievements in declining tobacco cigarette initiation among teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study provides added support for urgent response by policymakers to stop their use by teenagers to decrease direct harms in this susceptible population group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the availability and usage of e-cigarettes, this study provides added support for urgent response by policymakers to stop their use by teenagers to decrease direct harms in this susceptible population group. The study presented in this paper was conducted as part of broader program of evidence reviews to inform and support public health policy in Ireland, which included mapping of the harms and benefits of e-cigarettes (and their e-liquids) [McCarthy 2020] and a systematic review of e-cigarettes role in smoking cessation [Quigley 2020]. We found that e-cigarettes (and their e-liquids) lead to acute harms such as poisoning, lung injury, and burns and blast injuries, a finding aligned with six other systematic reviews [Peruga 2020; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, Medicine2018, Pisinger 2014; CADTH 2017; Byrne 2018; Bals 2019] and highlighted a need for continuing study using robust methods to measure the long-term health impacts of their use as these are not yet known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children and adolescents require the same protection from e-cigarettes as conventional tobacco cigarettes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children and adolescents require the same protection from e-cigarettes as conventional tobacco cigarettes through a well-enforced regulatory regime of measures including age restriction on purchase, control of availability through licensing outlets, limits to product visibility and attractiveness, and appropriate pricing through taxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join us for a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; showcase at the 30th Annual meeting of the Organization for Computational Neuroscience (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnsorg.org&quot;&gt;OCNS&lt;/a&gt;) on July 3, 2021.
You can register for CNS*2021 &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2021&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The showcase will also be recorded for later viewing.
The description of the showcase is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Neuroscience is heavily dependent on the availability of Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) tools that support the modern scientific process.
While more and more tools are now being developed using FOSS driven methods to ensure free (free to use, study, modify, and share---and so also free of cost) access to all, the complexity of these domain specific tools makes their uptake by the multi-disciplinary neuroscience target audience non-trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NeuroFedora community initiative aims to make it easier for all to use neuroscience software tools.
Using the resources of the FOSS Fedora community, NeuroFedora volunteers identify, package, test, document, and disseminate neuroscience software for easy usage on the general purpose FOSS Fedora Linux Operating System (OS).
As a result, users can easily install a myriad of software tools in only two steps: install any flavour of the Fedora OS; install the required tools using the in-built package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make common computational neuroscience tools even more accessible, NeuroFedora now provides an OS image that is ready to download and use.
Users can obtain the CompNeuroFedora OS image  from the community website at &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://labs.fedoraproject.org/&quot;&gt;https://labs.fedoraproject.org/&lt;/a&gt; .
They can either install it, or run it “live” from the installation image.
The software showcase will introduce the audience to the NeuroFedora community initiative.
It will demonstrate the CompNeuroFedora installation image and the plethora of software tools for computational neuroscience that it includes.
It will also give the audience a quick overview of how the NeuroFedora community functions and how they may contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User documentation for NeuroFedora can be found at &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While some vegetarians yearn for meat (and occasionally give into temptation), others who eschew animal products find meat repulsive. Those who go veggie for moral reasons — as opposed to those who do it for their health — are &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1997.tb00685.x&quot;&gt;particularly likely&lt;/a&gt; to find meat disgusting, even if they previously enjoyed its taste.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666321002063?via%3Dihub#!&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; from a University of Exeter team, it isn’t just vegetarians who find the look of meat disgusting, either — sometimes, meat-eaters do too. And in a world where many of us are being encouraged to give up meat for the sake of the environment, the researchers suggest that harnessing this disgust could be a way of reducing intake when other techniques fail.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42446&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 711 participants in the study were a mix of people with different diets — 56% identified as omnivores, 28% as flexitarians (i.e. those who are sometimes vegetarian and sometimes omnivorous), and 15% vegetarians, some of whom were vegan and some pescatarian.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, an implicit association task (IAT) measured implicit attitudes towards meat. Participants were presented with a series of images of foods, which they had to classify as meat or carbs, and words like “foul” or “mouth-watering”, which they had to classify as “delicious” or “disgusting”. The participants sorted both images and words into categories using left and right keys on their keyboard: for example, on one side they might see “carbs OR disgusting” and on the other “meat OR delicious” (in other trials, “meat” was paired with “disgusting” instead). If you find meat delicious, then responding should be faster when “meat” and “delicious” share the same key, the logic goes (though the IAT itself has &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/05/psychologys-favourite-tool-for-measuring-implicit-bias-is-still-mired-in-controversy/&quot;&gt;faced controversy&lt;/a&gt;).    &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, the team looked at &lt;em&gt;explicit&lt;/em&gt; responses to meat. The same pictures of meat and carbs were used, with participants asked to rate the images on a scale from 0 to 100 according to taste, how likely they would be to eat the food, and feelings of disgust. Finally, the team measured self-control, how much meat participants ate, and how long they had followed their particular diet. A follow-up survey, six months later, repeated these measures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vegetarians exhibited the highest level of disgust in both the explicit and implicit tests, with flexitarians second highest above omnivores. Carbs, on the other hand, were liked equally across all groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vegetarians don’t like meat: it’s hardly breaking news. But what &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; interesting about the results was the relationship between meat disgust and intake in the other two groups. In both the omnivore and flexitarian sample those who felt higher explicit meat disgust also had lower meat intake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The follow-up study provided further evidence that disgust has a tangible impact on how people eat. Flexitarians who showed an increase in their levels of explicit disgust of meat over the six month period had also decreased their meat intake by the time of the second survey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Encouraging disgust of meat could, therefore, be a way of encouraging people to cut down on meat. The team points to previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.766&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; that suggests many omnivores simply repress feelings of disgust around eating sentient, emotional creatures: harnessing this knowledge and increasing disgust could be one way of persuading someone that life is better vegetarian. However, it may not be a foolproof strategy — at present, it’s not clear in which direction the effect is working. Is disgust causing people to cut down on meat, or is cutting down on meat increasing disgust? Further research could look more closely at the direction of cause-and-effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666321002063?via%3Dihub#!&quot;&gt;Meat disgust is negatively associated with meat intake – Evidence from a cross-sectional and longitudinal study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;Last March, I shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2020/03/24/thoughts-on-the-gautret-et-al-paper-about-hydroxychloroquine-and-azithromycin-treatment-of-covid-19-infections/&quot;&gt;my concerns&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996&quot;&gt;a paper &lt;/a&gt;from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/en/&quot;&gt;IHU-Méditerranée Infection&lt;/a&gt; (IHUMI)/ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.univ-amu.fr/en&quot;&gt;Aix-Marseille University&lt;/a&gt; (AMU) claiming that Hydroxychloroquine in combination with Azithromycin could reduce coronavirus viral loads faster than no treatment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other papers by this group of researchers led by Professor Didier Raoult and/or his right-hand man Professor Eric Chabrière, also appear to contain problems, ranging from potentially duplicated images to ethical concerns. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this blog post I have gathered the papers by the Raoult and Chabrière group that have image concerns. This post is not an accusation of misconduct, but a compilation of the potential problems found in 22 different papers by this group.  I welcome the authors removing any concerns by providing the original figures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-2587&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Concerns about duplicated images&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A set of at least 22 papers from the AMU/IHUMI group appear to have problematic images, including unexpected similarities across or even within figure panels. All of these have been posted on Pubpeer, including nineteen that I found and posted there. As of today the authors have not replied to most of these PubPeer posts, nor have they corrected the errors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Category I duplications&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some papers, such as DOI: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8135188/&quot;&gt;10.1093/ajcp/101.3.318&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/FF00F9CF37B71EE26560B12659F1ED&quot;&gt;PubPeer&lt;/a&gt;] or &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17337224/&quot;&gt;10.1016/j.ijid.2006.10.005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/21381A2B9753BDC9DB7D2F1957088A&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/21381A2B9753BDC9DB7D2F1957088A&quot;&gt;PubPeer&lt;/a&gt;] appear to contain ‘simple’ duplications in figure panels. As explained in &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2019/11/23/scanning-for-duplications/&quot;&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I call these &lt;strong&gt;Category I duplications&lt;/strong&gt;, where the exact same photo is used to represent two different experiments. These kinds of simple duplications can often be honest errors, where something went wrong during the paper submission or manuscript handling. A cheerful “Oops, yes you are right, we made an error” would have been enough, and these duplicated panels could be easily addressed with a Corrigendum.

&lt;h3&gt;Category II duplications&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two papers in this set contain &lt;strong&gt;Category II duplications&lt;/strong&gt;, where images overlap or might have been rotated, mirrored, etc. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DOI &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26598566/&quot;&gt;10.4269/ajtmh.15-0436&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/D2FBE34F49E965A8BE6730E531E9F1&quot;&gt;PubPeer&lt;/a&gt;] has been corrected after posting it on PubPeer. In this paper, three of the four panels shown in Figure 1 were showing the same specimen. The aspect ratio of these overlapping areas, marked below with blue and magenta boxes, was not always the same. It appears the images might have been stretched differently, which would be unexpected if the errors were unintentional. Yet, the journal accepted a new set of panels in the July 2020 correction. The authors wrote: “&lt;em&gt;These resulted from errors by a researcher that were missed by other authors. Specifically, a single image was inappropriately inserted to represent three different experiments.&lt;/em&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;

Of note, the name of senior author Didier Raoult was removed some time between the acceptance of the paper [&lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.319.1904&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&quot;&gt;JCM Accepts version&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/yjnmL&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;] and the publication of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JCM.01714-06?download=true&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; on the journal’s website. In 2006, the year this paper was published, Raoult was banned from publishing in ASM journals for 1 year, which might have something to do with this author name removal (source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6072/1033)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6072/1033)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Category III duplications&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At least 10 AMU/IHUM papers with image problems contain &lt;strong&gt;Category III duplications&lt;/strong&gt;, where figures appear to have been altered or to contain duplicated elements. These types of duplications are the most likely to be the result of an intention-to-mislead. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Category III duplications were found in these papers:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As a scientist, interacting with data allows you to gain new insight into the phenomena you’re studying. If you read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/30/us/2020-year-in-graphics.html&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://d3js.org/&quot;&gt;D3&lt;/a&gt; docs or you browse &lt;a href=&quot;https://distill.pub/&quot;&gt;distill&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see impressive browser-based visualizations – interactive storytelling that not only accurately represent data but bring your attention to surprising aspects of it. Making good visualizations of your work can increase the accessibility of your research to a wide audience. My favorite example here (already several years old) is the semantic map of the brain from James Gao, Alex Huth, Jack Gallant and crew – at the time, visualizing brain map data in the browser was unheard of, and here was a visualization of how semantics map to different brain areas, in the browser, no downloads necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7653&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7653&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-1.png?w=564&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-1.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-1.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;564,413&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-1-4/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-1.png?w=564&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Snapshot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gallantlab.org/brainviewer/Deniz2019/&quot;&gt;brain data visualization&lt;/a&gt; from James Gao, Jack Gallant, Alex Huth and crew. Built on three.js and tornado. You can make these kind of visualizations yourself with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gallantlab/pycortex&quot;&gt;pycortex library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coming from the Python world, most visualizations you’ll make on a day-to-day basis will be very different from these: static plots, because that’s what’s convenient to make in matplotlib. How can you go from the Python world of static plots to the wizardry of Javascript?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A big wall you’ll run into is that modern web development is big. Getting to proficiency is hard: it’s very easy to get discouraged and fall off the wagon before you get to build something interesting. What I’ve assembled here is a kind of roadmap so that you can start building interesting dynamic visualizations with the lowest barrier to entry as possible, while building a self-reinforcing skillset. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-table is-style-stripes&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Technology&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Application areas&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Pros&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Cons&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;What you learn&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Python-based generators&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dashboards, lightweight interactions&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Easy distribution, low barrier to entry&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Limited interactivity&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Grammar of interactive graphics&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Jupyter notebook&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Daily data exploration&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;You’re already using it!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Distribution not straightforward&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Snippets of HTML, JS, SVG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Walled garden&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;All-in-one visualizations (widgets)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Limited things to learn&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;What you learn is non-transferable&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The walled garden&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;JS notebooks&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Literate programs&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;REPL environment, good docs&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Learning curve a bit steep&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Core JS plus visualization libraries&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;The web&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Web dataviz&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;You control everything&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Floodgates of tech stack, learning curve quite steep&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Packaging, components, deployment&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, at the end of this article, I cover JS libraries you might want to learn to do for plotting or numeric work. I’ve built this from experience over the last year experimenting with about a half-dozen interactive visualization methods; of course, if you know better curricula, books or tutorials, please let me know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Step 0: Python-based libraries&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your first option is to not code for the web at all by leveraging pure Python-based libraries. Many libraries aim to fill a niche for everyday interactive graphics, which include minimal interactions – hover interactions, tooltips, interactive legends, etc. This includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://plotly.com/&quot;&gt;Plotly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://holoviews.org/user_guide/Dashboards.html&quot;&gt;Bokeh w/Holoviews&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/interactions.html&quot;&gt;Altair w/vegalite&lt;/a&gt;. On the mapping side, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet&quot;&gt;ipyleaflet&lt;/a&gt; is worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Dashboard tools&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7657&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7657&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-2&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;838,742&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-2-4/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png?w=300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/demo-uber-nyc-pickups/&quot;&gt;A demo visualization in streamlit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There has been an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/patrickmineault/status/1397574692135919617&quot;&gt;explosive growth in the past few years&lt;/a&gt;. These solutions fill the same niche as the ubiquitous Shiny fills in the R ecosystem: a way for data science teams to create dashboards. You can nevertheless use them for interactive scientific visualizations. Getting familiar with this kind of visualization will help you build a grammar of interactive visualizations and rapidly prototype more fully interactive visualizations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to expect: a Python script defines a visualization (plots, videos, images, maps, etc.) along with widgets, such as sliders and combo boxes. The whole thing gets served via a server which caches requests intelligently – changes in sliders trigger remote fetches which refresh the visualization. Some custom visualizations may be written in JS. Oftentimes, dashboard solutions are associated with a specific plotting library. so all the docs will be written in terms of that library – but generally you have some flexibility to use other frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One clarification: if you want to share your visualizations, you’ll need a server. All solutions have a basic open source offering allowing you to DIY deploy such a server yourself via e.g. a cloud provider. If that sounds messy, you can instead opt for a managed cloud solution – there’s often a free tier and paid tiers with more capabilities availables. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-table is-style-stripes&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Product&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Deployment&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Peculiarities&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Associated plotting library&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://panel.holoviz.org/&quot;&gt;Panel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DIY&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Works inside of jupyter and standalone&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Bokeh, with support other charting libraries&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://streamlit.io/&quot;&gt;Streamlit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DIY &amp;amp; commercial&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Very easy deploys&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Agnostic&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plotly.com/dash/&quot;&gt;Dash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DIY &amp;amp; commercial&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Supports lots of customization, aimed at enterprise users&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Plotly, with support for other libraries&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of these, Streamlit seems to have the most momentum according to Github stars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-6.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7716&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7716&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-6&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-6.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-6.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-6.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1454,896&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-6-3/&quot; height=&quot;412&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-6.png?w=1024&quot; width=&quot;681&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;See this article for &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/streamlit-vs-dash-vs-voil%C3%A0-vs-panel-battle-of-the-python-dashboarding-giants-177c40b9ea57&quot;&gt;a detailed breakdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: build for jupyter notebook&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the lowest friction way of doing dynamic HTML-based visualization in Python is in the jupyter notebook environment (or jupyter lab or colab). After all, you’re writing Python inside the browser &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;, why not use the same environment to whip up a quick interactive visualization? A big advantage of this type of solution is that it minimizes the contortions you have to go through to translate Python data types to javascript. And because you’re writing HTML, JS and Python side-by-side, your iteration cycles are very fast. The biggest problem is that most widgets you will create here will not display correctly when you publish them to the web, e.g. on GitHub: people will have to download the notebook to get the interactive effect. They will work inside of Binder, however. They are a great way to dip your toe into this world – at this point, you can probably get by by copying and pasting snippets of HTML, CSS, SVG and Javascript rather than formally learning them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;_repr_html_ and IPython.core.display&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Image&quot; height=&quot;126&quot; src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2sASUzXMAMrd68?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=large&quot; width=&quot;417&quot; /&gt;Basic demo of _repr_html_&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you print a variable at the end of a Jupyter cell, how does Jupyter know how to display it? The answer is that it looks for a &lt;code&gt;_repr_html_&lt;/code&gt; method for the associated class and calls it. This function can return any arbitrary snippet of HTML, including an iframe which does interactive things, or a snippet which embeds javascript. &lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eXwpjEzMMzu5EllJ3ljq_zEMVFAnifUR?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;See this colab for examples on how to do this&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mrocklin/status/1145265419638513669&quot;&gt;You can do fairly sophisticated things with this simple method&lt;/a&gt;, for instance building an interactive widget for pandas. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You may also trigger a rich display from anywhere inside a cell, not just at the end, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25698448/how-to-embed-html-into-ipython-output&quot;&gt;using the ipython API&lt;/a&gt;. Again, you can include any number of web technologies, including embedding scripts inside the embedded HTML.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code &quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;from IPython.core.display import display, HTML
display(HTML('&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Hello, world!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;'))
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;ipywidgets and interact&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ipywidgets&lt;/strong&gt;, also known as jupyter-widgets or simply widgets, are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Index.ipynb&quot;&gt;interactive HTML widgets&lt;/a&gt; for Jupyter notebooks and the IPython kernel. Notebooks come alive when interactive widgets are used. Users gain control of their data and can visualize changes in the data. Learning becomes an immersive, fun experience. Researchers can easily see how changing inputs to a model impact the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot;&gt;The ipywidget manual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next in line in complexity are &lt;code&gt;ipywidgets&lt;/code&gt;. Like &lt;code&gt;IPython.core.display&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ipywidgets&lt;/code&gt; can display rich HTML; however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20Events.html&quot;&gt;widgets can also have events which cause them to call Python&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eXwpjEzMMzu5EllJ3ljq_zEMVFAnifUR#scrollTo=aFiczwJ9h5v5&quot;&gt;See this notebook for an example&lt;/a&gt;. You can use them, for instance, to navigate through a plot with widgets. In fact, this pattern is so common that there’s a convenience function called &lt;code&gt;interact&lt;/code&gt; which allows you to do just slider-based interactions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;voila&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/voila-dashboards/voila/master/voila-bqplot.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila&quot;&gt;Voila example, from their docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building on jupyter widgets, you can release fully fledged dashboards based in jupyter notebooks. This is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila&quot;&gt;voila&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is that you write a regular jupyter notebook, and then you can serve it through a tornado server on the web. The end user sees a dashboard which is the concatenation of the output cells of the dashboard, without the code. You can deploy this on Heroku or Google App Engine to make your application world accessible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Walled gardens&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this point, you might feel stifled by the limited interactivity afforded by the solutions offered so far. And you might feel intimidated by full-fledged modern web development. Many products exist to fill the gap. However, I argue here that it’s better to bite the bullet and skip straight ahead to writing &lt;em&gt;real javascript&lt;/em&gt; in a notebook environment, because you will continue building on core skill sets around web technology. Nevertheless, I mention these options here for completeness and because they may satisfy your particular use case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Unity&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;A little Plinko sim&lt;img alt=&quot;🎄&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f384.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 1em;&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/unity3d?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#unity3d&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/geKwfhlpj6&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/geKwfhlpj6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Patrick Mineault (@patrickmineault) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/patrickmineault/status/1209900584473632770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 25, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unity.com/&quot;&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt; is a game development engine and IDE. It’s a great environment to build offline games and VR visualizations. It transpiles exported scenes and C#-based scripting to WebAssembly (WASM), so it also runs in the browser. C# is a modern language with operator overloading. 2d and 3d interaction are easily accommodated. Cons: widgets (sliders, input boxes, etc.) must be created in the Unity interface and are non-native. The Unity applet acts as a walled garden, making it &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-interactingwithbrowserscripting.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;difficult to interact with the native DOM&lt;/a&gt;. The C# code cannot be compiled with a command line tool – it must be combined with the project and compiled in the Unity editor, and the project is several GBs, hence can’t be tracked in Github. Furthermore, the math libraries in C# are pretty limited. Overall, a pretty limited option for the web, though it has considerable appeal if you’re doing 3d viz.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;p5.js and openprocessing&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress wp-embed-aspect-1-1 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OpenProcessing sketch, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openprocessing.org/sketch/853689&quot;&gt;Self-organized critical model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://p5js.org/&quot;&gt;p5.js&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openprocessing.org/&quot;&gt;openprocessing&lt;/a&gt; bring processing – a creative coding platform – to javascript. You write sketches, with an init function and a loop function, which define how the sketch works. You draw into the sketch with functions that allow you to draw lines, rectangles, sprites, polygons, etc. The appeal of processing is that you’re learning creative coding and there are very little barriers to entry. The biggest con is that while you learn a little bit of javascript in the environments, you really don’t learn modern web technologies. At the end of the day, you’ll know how to draw into your sketch, but you won’t know about canvas, svg, css, etc. – and you’ll be limited in the libraries that you can import into that environment. That being said, they can be part of your toolkit, especially p5.js which can interop with plain JS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Javascript notebooks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step in complexity is Javascript-based notebooks. Just as there are Python-based notebook environments that use remote kernels (jupyter, colab), there are local notebook-based environments that use Javascript that runs locally in the browser. That means you get the full power of the web – html, canvas, css, svg, javascript with remote libraries, etc. – but you’re doing it in an environment on wheels which supports the familiar REPL workflow of jupyter notebooks. These are environments which are ideal for literate programming which mixes text, math, code and visualization. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For many, I suspect this will be the right level of complexity. In practice, using notebooks mean you will need to export your data out of Python in order to visualize it – for many use cases, json will do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Observable&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7664&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7664&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-3&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=603&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;603,602&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-3-3/&quot; height=&quot;572&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=603&quot; width=&quot;573&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Text, code, equations, dynamic visualizations can all be mixed in observable. &lt;a href=&quot;https://observablehq.com/@xcorr/optimal-control-example&quot;&gt;Code here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://observablehq.com/&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/a&gt; is a notebook environment that runs in the browser, created by Mike Bostock, creator of d3. Observable is a little like jupyter notebooks, but it uses a kind of functional style where each cell may only have one output, and it resolves the DAG of dependencies to figure out which cells to recompute at what time, thus avoiding the pitfalls of ipython out-of-order execution issues.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://observablehq.com/tutorials&quot;&gt;It has an excellent set of starter tutorials&lt;/a&gt;. The observable runtime is open-source, but the notebook environment is closed-source. It continues to be feverishly developed – they just added multi-user collaboration. Strictly speaking, &lt;a href=&quot;https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observables-not-javascript&quot;&gt;it does not use Javascript&lt;/a&gt;, and it doesn’t make it very easy to export strict JS out of it – however, you can embed single cells on a webpage. Overall, a great place to get your REPL workflow going.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Starboard&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7671&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7671&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;coupled-oscillators&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=380&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;380,380&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/coupled-oscillators/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=380&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;An interactive visualization of coupled oscillators in Starboard, mixed Python and JS. &lt;a href=&quot;https://starboard.gg/pmin/desync-nKw0R7a&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://starboard.gg/&quot;&gt;Starboard&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source interactive notebook environment. It uses a different metaphor than Observable, sticking much closer to the Jupyter metaphor with its advantages and disadvantages. The biggest thing it has going for is that it supports both javascript and python via &lt;a href=&quot;https://pyodide.org/en/stable/&quot;&gt;Pyodide&lt;/a&gt;. What’s that you say? Python in the browser? Why yes, in fact:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pyodide brings the Python 3.8 runtime to the browser via WebAssembly, along with the Python scientific stack including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and scikit-learn. The packages directory lists over 75 packages which are currently available. In addition it’s possible to install pure Python wheels from PyPi. Pyodide provides transparent conversion of objects between Javascript and Python. When used inside a browser, Python has full access to the Web APIs.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Pyodide docs&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means you can keep some of the numerical computation in Python and mix and match JS and Python as necessary – though you’ll probably still want to use Javascript to manipulate the DOM. Pyodide was originally spun out by Mozilla from another (now defunct) notebook project called iodide, so starboard, along with a few others like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jtpio/jupyterlite&quot;&gt;jupyterlite&lt;/a&gt; are carrying the torch. I really like starboard – the editor feels great, it’s snappy, it has surprisingly little confusing magic going on. However, the documentation and examples are minimal, and it would benefit from a series of tutorials. I think observable is the more viable and mature option in this space for now but starboard is one to watch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: the web&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now you’ve had a chance to learn javascript, html, svg, enough css to do the job in the context of dynamic visualizations, and now you’re ready to tackle the world – the world wide web! It’s tempting at this point to learn modern web development, with its complex toolchains (npm + react + webpack + …) . I had an interesting conversation with Chris Olah recently who mentioned that when it comes to doing visualizations, the core skillsets – html, the dom, css, svg, etc. – are more important than learning any particular framework, and it helped organize this article. If you do need a component framework to work within a larger page, a more lightweight framework, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/&quot;&gt;Svelte&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;vue.js&lt;/a&gt;, might satisfy your needs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One very annoying gotcha you’ll run into is packaging differences between node and JS built for the web. A lot of packages you’ll use for data analysis in JS – like mathjs – were originally built for the node server environment. You need to build them to use them, which means learning about build tools, and pretty soon you’ve wasted a couple of days figuring out your transpiler. There are now cloud transpilers, in particular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skypack.dev/&quot;&gt;skypack&lt;/a&gt; and JSPM, that will compile node JS libraries for you so you can use them immediately without using a complex toolchain. That means you can import node packages in JS much in the same way you would import pip installable packages in Python:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;import * as mathjs from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/mathjs@8.0.1';
console.log(mathjs.add(1,2));&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Guido Zuidhof &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gzuidhof/starboard-notebook/issues/42&quot;&gt;for patiently explaining this to me&lt;/a&gt;. For deployment, provided you don’t rely on external services, you could use github pages, or use a CDN service like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/&quot;&gt;netlify&lt;/a&gt;. If you need to interact with data, then you may need to both create and deploy a data source via a REST API. Something lightweight like &lt;a href=&quot;https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/&quot;&gt;flask&lt;/a&gt; deployed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackabuse.com/deploying-a-flask-application-to-heroku&quot;&gt;heroku&lt;/a&gt; would do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;JS libraries&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you’re going through this process, it will often feel like the garden of forking paths: seemingly infinite decisions to make. However, there’s a small core set of JS libraries you might interact with:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;d3: data driven documents in JS, &lt;a href=&quot;https://d3js.org/&quot;&gt;https://d3js.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;mathjs: math, vectors, matrices in JS: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mathjs.org/&quot;&gt;https://mathjs.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;stdlib: a standard library for JS, including distributions: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib&quot;&gt;https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vega lite: declarative plots in JS: &lt;a href=&quot;https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/&quot;&gt;https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tensorflow.js: tensor computation library in the browser: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/js&quot;&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three.js: 3d visualizations for the web: &lt;a href=&quot;https://threejs.org/&quot;&gt;https://threejs.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arquero: like dplyr, for the web: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uwdata/arquero&quot;&gt;https://github.com/uwdata/arquero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think this is enough of a curriculum to carry you from 0 to 1 over a 6 month period. Practice, learn, and in no time you’ll be ready to make solid visualizations!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Further resources&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/iodide-an-experimental-tool-for-scientific-communicatiodide-for-scientific-communication-exploration-on-the-web/&quot;&gt;Iodide blog post&lt;/a&gt; (Iodide is deprecated, but the background and resources linked are still relevant)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://js4ds.org&quot;&gt;Js4DS&lt;/a&gt; – comprehensive intro to JS for data science (long! doesn’t talk about d3)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27127387&quot;&gt;Recent Pyodide overview on HackerNews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25161409&quot;&gt;Recent observable thread on HN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://distill.pub/&quot;&gt;Distill&lt;/a&gt; (for inspiration)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://benschmidt.org/post/2020-01-15/2020-01-15-webgpu/&quot;&gt;JS and the next decade of data programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://observablehq.com/top&quot;&gt;Observable top notebooks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://javascript.info/&quot;&gt;The modern JS tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://learnjsdata.com/&quot;&gt;Learn JS data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newline.co/fullstack-d3&quot;&gt;Full stack D3&lt;/a&gt; (a paid, structured 8 week course)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pyviz.org/&quot;&gt;PyViz&lt;/a&gt; – comprehensive reference for Python visualization packages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">
 &lt;p&gt;arXiv’s members have provided approximately 25% of our operating budget for the past ten years, supporting arXiv’s mission to provide a reliable open platform for sharing research. By becoming arXiv members, more than 230 institutions around the world have made a strong statement in favor of open access, open science, and sustainable academic publishing. Thank you, members!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy to announce our &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/membership&quot;&gt;updated membership program&lt;/a&gt;, which was developed in collaboration with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/people/member_ad_board&quot;&gt;Membership Advisory Board&lt;/a&gt;. This program is part of our&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/05/26/arxiv-sustainability-model/&quot;&gt; sustainability model&lt;/a&gt;, complements arXiv’s diverse &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/funding&quot;&gt;funding sources, including societies and other organizations, &lt;/a&gt;and ensures that arXiv will have the funding required to continue meeting researchers’ evolving needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv membership is inclusive, flexible, and offers your institution a high value, low-risk, budget-conscious option to serve your scholarly community. Members receive public recognition, institutional usage statistics, eligibility to serve in arXiv’s governance, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universities, libraries, research institutes, and laboratories are invited to join or renew. For standard memberships, annual fees are based on submissions by institution, averaged over three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_institution_submissions&quot;&gt;find your institution’s overall submission rank here,&lt;/a&gt; as shown in the screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_1003&quot; style=&quot;width: 836px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot of interface to find submissions by institution&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1003 size-full&quot; height=&quot;377&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/Find-submissions-by-institution-1.png&quot; width=&quot;836&quot; /&gt;Hover your cursor over the area indicated by the purple arrow to reveal the search icon.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, match the overall rank to one of the contribution levels here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;If an institution ranks in the top 100 submitting institutions, their fee is $5000. Institutions ranked between 101 and 500 are charged $2500. Institutions ranked above 500 are charged $1000.&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-1004 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/Member-Levels-2021-05-26-at-11.08.59-AM.png&quot; width=&quot;409&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The top 100 institutions submitting articles to arXiv are invited to become members at the $5,000 level. The fee for institutions ranked between 101 and 500 is $2,500, and the fee for institutions ranked above 501 is $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Institutions that join or renew now will lock in their membership fee for 2022, 2023, and 2024. Institutions joining as part of a consortium will receive a 10% discount. Country-level consortia will receive a higher discount, depending on the level of participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In the example below, the university’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_institution_submissions&quot;&gt;overall submission rank&lt;/a&gt; is 182, which corresponds to the $2500 standard membership fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_1008&quot; style=&quot;width: 746px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Example submission data&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1008 size-full&quot; height=&quot;149&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/Submissions-example.png&quot; width=&quot;746&quot; /&gt;The overall rank, which is the three year submission average, is indicated by the purple arrow.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two flexible alternatives&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your institution is a champion of open access and has the budget to support a higher contribution, we offer the &lt;strong&gt;Champion&lt;/strong&gt; membership at $10,000 and above. Other institutions use arXiv &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_institution_downloads_by_year&quot;&gt;primarily for reading&lt;/a&gt; or face significant budget limitations. For these institutions, &lt;strong&gt;Community&lt;/strong&gt; membership is our most inclusive option, at an amount between $250 and $1000. All members receive the same benefits and are eligible to serve in arXiv’s governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join or renew today&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready to commit to open access, open science, and sustainable academic publishing? &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/membership_confirm&quot;&gt;Join, renew, or confirm your membership here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you represent a nonprofit or a company? &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/support_confirm&quot;&gt;Confirm your support here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions? &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:membership@arxiv.org&quot;&gt;We’re happy to help.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we are grateful to our strong community of supporters and everyone who contributed to developing our updated sustainability model and membership program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<updated>2021-06-02T15:43:40+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">
 &lt;p&gt;In collaboration with the Membership Advisory Board and arXiv’s leadership team, we’re pleased to announce &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/funding&quot;&gt;arXiv’s updated sustainability model&lt;/a&gt;. This model, which is an expansion of the existing membership program, complements funding received from Cornell University, the Simons Foundation, and individual donors — and ensures that arXiv thrives for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nearly ten years, members have supported arXiv with funding and expertise — and for that we are grateful! As arXiv has grown, the number of organizations we interact with has expanded greatly, reflecting arXiv’s interdisciplinary nature. To welcome this wonderful diversity and encourage the entire arXiv community to contribute to arXiv’s financial future, we’ve expanded our sustainability model to include three programs for specific types of supporters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Members &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our membership program will remain central to arXiv’s sustainability. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/ourmembers&quot;&gt;Universities, libraries, laboratories, and research institutes&lt;/a&gt; across the globe are invited to become members (or renew their existing memberships) and represent the scholars who use arXiv to read and share research. Members support arXiv with essential funding and scholarly communications expertise, and members are also eligible to serve in arXiv’s governance. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/06/02/membership-program-submissions/&quot;&gt;Learn more about updates to the membership program here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Affiliates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/supporters&quot;&gt;Professional societies, government agencies, and other nonprofits &lt;/a&gt;collaborate with arXiv in a variety of ways, ranging from facilitating conference proceeding submissions to promoting open access compliance. Suggested contribution levels range from $5,000 to $100,000, or the in-kind equivalent. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/support_confirm&quot;&gt;Become an affiliate or renew your support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sponsors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/supporters&quot;&gt;Companies&lt;/a&gt; that benefit from arXiv’s services are encouraged to support the infrastructure with funding and in-kind donations such as developer time and cloud services. Suggested contribution levels range from $10,000 to $200,000, or the in-kind equivalent. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/support_confirm&quot;&gt;Become a sponsor or renew your support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited to grow our base of supporters, remain transparent about our funding sources, ensure that the cost to operate arXiv is distributed fairly across the community, and continue to meet researchers’ evolving needs. Specifically, our priority is to provide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continuous level of service for supporting exponential growth in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions&quot;&gt;submissions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_downloads&quot;&gt;downloads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seamless interoperability with other platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increased completeness and quality of metadata records, including support for affiliation and funding information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modernization of backend services and technological infrastructure for improved stability, performance and innovation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already support arXiv, thank you! If not, we encourage you to consider how you or your organization can get involved. You’re invited to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:membership@arxiv.org&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; to start the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Loneliness can be something of a vicious cycle. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/07/21/your-personality-can-invite-loneliness-and-loneliness-can-shape-your-personality/&quot;&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested, your personality can increase your likelihood of being lonely, and loneliness can impact your personality. We also know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/10/25/ten-year-study-finds-loneliness-and-self-centeredness-appear-to-be-mutually-reinforcing/&quot;&gt;self-centredness&lt;/a&gt; can increase loneliness, that being &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/11/16/being-true-to-yourself-may-protect-against-the-harmful-effects-of-loneliness/&quot;&gt;true to yourself&lt;/a&gt; can reduce loneliness, and that even &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/27/cold-days-can-make-us-long-for-social-contact-but-warming-up-our-bodies-eliminates-this-desire/&quot;&gt;warming yourself up on a cold day&lt;/a&gt; can ease cravings for social contact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Loneliness, then, is highly dependent on personality factors as well as social factors such as discrimination, limited access to transport, and lack of social cohesion. And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211007228&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, identifies another individual factor: low self-control. According to Olga Stavrova and team from Tilburg University in the Netherlands, failures of self-control can have serious social ramifications — leading to ostracism and, eventually, loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42440&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first study used data from 2,710 participants taking part in a longitudinal survey in the Netherlands. The team looked specifically at one time point in the study, where participants had answered questions on self-control, indicating how much they agreed with statements like “I am good at resisting temptation”, and loneliness, responding to statements such as “I have a sense of emptiness around me”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined participants’ Big Five personality traits, as well as demographic variables that have been previously associated with loneliness — gender, age, whether or not the participant lived alone or with partners or children, education, employment status, and income.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results showed that lower self-control predicts higher loneliness, an effect similar in size to that of some other predictors of loneliness such as low levels of extraversion and agreeableness (however, low emotional stability was a much stronger predictor than low self-control).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second study looked at day-to-day feelings of loneliness. Participants took part in a daily diary exercise, writing every day for a week about how lonely they had felt, and how often they had given in to a temptation. They also completed a measure of “trait” levels of self-control to measure base levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again, those with lower trait self-control were more likely to experience loneliness. Furthermore, those who reported failures in self-control on one day were also more likely to report loneliness in their diary on the subsequent day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why might lower self-control lead to loneliness? The researchers wondered whether low self-control signals that someone is not trustworthy, and so makes them more likely to be ostracised by others. So in another study, they asked participants to read a short paragraph about Robin, a (fabricated) previous participant who was having problems saving money but who nonetheless had ended up in an expensive electronics shop. In the low self-control condition, participants read that Robin had bought himself a new smartphone — even though he didn’t need one — while the high self-control condition heard that Robin had resisted temptation and left the shop empty-handed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They were then asked to imagine that Robin was a new co-worker and to indicate how likely they were to exclude him, and whether they thought he was likely to care for or take time for others, or engage in behaviours that could hurt others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consistent with their predictions, the team found that participants in the low self-control condition were more likely to ostracise Robin, which could partly be explained by the fact that they also perceived him as less prosocial and more likely to engage in selfish, potentially harmful behaviour. A final study found that participants with low self-control themselves reported experiencing greater experience of ostracism and more loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, overall, the results suggest that low self-control can increase loneliness — and that this increase occurs partly via social ostracism due to selfish impulses or potentially harmful behaviour. This makes sense — you may be more likely to be faithful to a partner or co-operate at work or in a game if you have higher self-control, which could make you seem more desirable as a friend, partner, or social contact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are other explanations, however. Those with low self-control may be ostracising &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt; — if you feel guilty or ashamed after a lapse in self-control, you might want to isolate yourself to deal with those feelings rather than being specifically excluded by others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future work could look at different kinds of self-control failure. If you fail to keep to a diet, for example, it only affects you — so would that lead to the same kind of ostracism that someone who can’t stop cheating on their partner might face? The team suggests that loneliness is more (or only) likely to occur when our actions have social repercussions; a closer look at this dynamic may shed more light on the relationship between ostracism, self-control and our social lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211007228&quot;&gt;Low Self-Control: A Hidden Cause of Loneliness?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Minghua Zheng will talk about a paper &quot;Class-Balanced Loss Based on Effective Number of Samples&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rapid increase of large-scale, real-world datasets, it
becomes critical to address the problem of longtailed data
distribution (i.e., a few classes account for most of the data, while
most classes are under-represented). Existing solutions typically
adopt class re-balancing strategies such as re-sampling and re-
weighting based on the number of observations for each class. In this
work, we argue that as the number of samples increases, the additional
benefit of a newly added data point will diminish. We introduce a
novel theoretical framework to measure data overlap by associating
with each sample a small neighboring region rather than a single
point. The effective number of samples is defined as the volume of
samples and can be calculated by a simple formula
(1-β^n)/(1-β), where n is the number of samples and β
∈ [0, 1) is a hyperparameter. We design a re-weighting scheme that
uses the effective number of samples for each class to re-balance the
loss, thereby yielding a class-balanced loss. Comprehensive
experiments are conducted on artificially induced long-tailed CIFAR
datasets and large-scale datasets including ImageNet and iNaturalist.
Our results show that when trained with the proposed class-balanced
loss, the network is able to achieve significant performance gains on
long-tailed datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

Incorporating a concept from deep learning, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(21)00064-7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Erik Hoel (2021)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“...outlines the idea that the brains of animals are constantly in danger of &lt;i&gt;overfitting&lt;/i&gt;,  which is the lack of generalizability that occurs in a deep neural  network when its learning is based too much on one particular dataset,  and that dreams help mitigate this ubiquitous issue. This is the  overfitted brian &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;[sic]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; hypothesis.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Overfitted Brain Hypothesis (OHB) proposes that the bizarre phenomenology of dreams is critical to their functional role. This view differs from most other neuroscientific theories, which treat dream content as epiphenomenal — a byproduct of brain activity involved in memory consolidation, replay, forgetting, synaptic pruning, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Hoel suggests that “it is the very strangeness of dreams in their divergence from waking experience that gives them their biological function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hallucinogenic, category-breaking, and fabulist quality of dreams means they are extremely different from the “training set” of the animal (i.e., their daily experiences). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up: the OBH conceptualizes dreams as a form of purposefully corrupted input, likely derived from noise injected into the hierarchical structure of the brain, causing feedback to generate warped or “corrupted” sensory input. The overall evolved purpose of this stochastic activity is to prevent overfitting. This overfitting may be within a particular module or task such a specific brain region or network, and may also involve generalization to out-of-distribution (unseen) novel stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of overfitting, I was reminded of Google's foray into &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html&quot;&gt;artificial neural networks&lt;/a&gt; for image classification, which was all the rage in July 2015. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DeepDream&lt;/a&gt; program is a visualization tool that shows what the layers of the neural network have learned:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;One way to visualize what goes on is to turn the network upside down and ask it to enhance an input image in such a way as to elicit a particular interpretation. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The image above is characteristic of the hallucinogenic output from the DeepDream web interface, and it illustrates that the original training set was filled with &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20150724110554/http://jtnimoy.com/blogs/projects/50616707-deepdream-avoiding-kitsch&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dogs, birds, and pagodas&lt;/a&gt;.  DeepDream images inspired blog posts with titles like, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiweirdness.com/post/171451900302/do-neural-nets-dream-of-electric-sheep&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Do neural nets dream of electric sheep?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/technology/2015/07/google-deepdream-its-dazzling-creepy-and-tells-us-a-lot-about-the-future-of-a-i.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Do Androids Dream of Electric Bananas?&lt;/a&gt; and my favorite, &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2015/07/scary-brains-and-garden-of-earthly-deep.html&quot;&gt;Scary Brains and the Garden of Earthly Deep Dreams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reference&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoel E.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electric fish seem to have mastered the art of the pause&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/05/electric-fish-pause/618993/&quot;&gt;writes Katherine J. Wu&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Brienomyrus brachyistius &lt;/em&gt;communicate by producing a series of electrical pulses. But researchers have found that the fish sometimes pause during their “conversations”, apparently as a signal that what they are about to communicate is important — similar to a “dramatic pause” in human speech.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42344&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As we covered &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/13/episode-24-how-children-learn-through-play/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in a recent podcast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, play is a vital part of children’s development. But how do the toys we choose to give kids shape their interests and skills?&lt;/strong&gt; At&lt;em&gt; BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210524-the-gender-biases-that-shape-our-brains&quot;&gt;Melissa Hogenboom explores&lt;/a&gt; how gendered toys can reinforce existing stereotypes and biases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have allowed a bind man to see again after 40 years, through the use of light-sensitive proteins injected into cells in the eye. &lt;/strong&gt;With the help of specialised goggles, the man was able to make out high-contrast images, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01421-0&quot;&gt;reports Sara Reardon&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. The study represents the first clinical use of optogenetics, a technique often used in basic neuroscience research. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;..and in other optogenetics news, researchers have used the technique to manipulate social behaviours in mice. &lt;/strong&gt;After inducing synchronous patterns of activity in the medial prefrontal cortex of two mice, the team found that the animals became more social, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/25/science/optogenetics-brain-social-behavior.html&quot;&gt;reports Virginia Hughes&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. The work has interesting parallels with that on “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/03/parents-have-more-synchronised-patterns-of-brain-activity-when-theyre-together/&quot;&gt;interbrain synchrony” in humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depending on the kinds of questions researchers ask, human memory can be seen as quite extraordinary — or really bad. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/our-memory-is-even-better-than-experts-thought/&quot;&gt;Nicole C. Rust examines&lt;/a&gt; the two perspectives at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychologists surely know enough about the replication crisis now to avoid uncritically citing work known to have issues… right? &lt;/strong&gt;Not according to a recent study, which looked at how often researchers cite work that has failed to replicate, compared to more robust findings. The team found that studies with replication issues were cited 153 times more often than those without, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/05/for-research-citations-no-replication-is-no-problem/&quot;&gt;reports John Timmer&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica &lt;/em&gt;— and those citations rarely mentioned the fact that the original paper had not replicated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, why do we often denigrate — or even punish — those who perform acts of altruism?&lt;/strong&gt; At The Observer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/may/23/why-are-we-so-uncharitable-to-those-doing-good-deeds&quot;&gt;Nichola Raihani&lt;/a&gt; explores why there is truth to the phrase “no good deed goes unpunished”.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Where is the spinothalamic tract?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The spinothalamic tract is a collection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; that carries information to the brain about pain, temperature, itch, and general or light touch sensations.

Next, neurons extend from the dorsal horn and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/decussation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;decussate&lt;/a&gt;, or cross over to the other side of the spinal cord, before traveling up the spinal cord, through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/brainstem&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brainstem&lt;/a&gt;, and to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thalamus&lt;/a&gt;.

        &lt;/figure&gt;
      

    
  


  


&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The lateral spinothalamic tract is the main pathway for carrying information about pain and temperature from the body to the brain. It is also thought to carry information about itch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sensations that are carried by the lateral spinothalamic tract begin with receptors such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/nociceptor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nociceptors&lt;/a&gt;, which detect painful sensations, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thermoreceptor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thermoreceptors&lt;/a&gt;, which detect changes in temperature. These receptors pass a signal to the initial neurons of the spinothalamic tract, which transmit the signal to the spinal cord. Here, the neurons briefly either ascend or descend as part of a tract called Lissauer’s tract before synapsing on neurons in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/dorsal-horn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dorsal horn of the spinal cord&lt;/a&gt; that belong to cell groups like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/nucleus-proprius&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nucleus proprius&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/substantia-gelatinosa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;substantia gelatinosa&lt;/a&gt;; the latter is an important area for the modulation of pain signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The secondary neurons in the lateral spinothalamic tract cross over to the other side of the spinal cord and then ascend in the spinal cord, through the brainstem, and to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/ventral-posterolateral-nucleus-vpl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ventral posterolateral (VPL) nucleus&lt;/a&gt; in the thalamus. Because this pathway travels in the anterolateral portion of the spinal cord and brainstem, it is often referred to as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/anterolateral-system&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;anterolateral system&lt;/a&gt;. In the thalamus, spinothalamic neurons synapse on cells that will carry the sensory information to the primary somatosensory cortex, which is the main processing area for sensations from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Anterior spinothalamic tract&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;
      

    
  


  


&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The anterior spinothalamic tract (aka ventral spinothalamic tract) carries general touch or light touch sensations from the body. This includes touch sensations that don’t involve pressure, such as the stroking of hair or air lightly blowing on the skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;These sensations begin with sensory receptors in the skin, which pass a signal onto neurons that travel to the spinal cord. In the spinal cord, these neurons give rise to ascending and descending branches that synapse on neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Secondary neurons arise from the nucleus proprius in the dorsal horn, cross over to the other side of the spinal cord, and ascend to the thalamus near the lateral spinothalamic tract. From there, the information is carried on to the somatosensory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Damage to the spinothalamic tract&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A spinal cord injury that involves the spinothalamic tract can lead to distinctive sensory deficits. Because neurons in the tract cross over to the other side of the spinal cord before traveling up to the brain, they are carrying information from the opposite side of the body. Thus, if there is damage to one side of the spinal cord, it can cause a loss of pain, temperature, and light touch sensations on the side of the body opposite from where the damage occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;References:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Augustine JR.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pain is not a purely biological phenomenon: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953618301163?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;discrimination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/189004382.pdf&quot;&gt;anxiety around work&lt;/a&gt;, and general &lt;a href=&quot;https://oem.bmj.com/content/74/7/468.short&quot;&gt;mental strain&lt;/a&gt; have all been shown to contribute to the experience of chronic pain. Many researchers therefore take a biopsychosocial approach, exploring the multifarious factors that impact &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; and are impacted &lt;em&gt;by &lt;/em&gt;pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smi.3038?saml_referrer&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Stress &amp;amp; Health&lt;/em&gt; explores the long term consequences of social factors on pain. The team, from the universities of Georgia and South California, Los Angeles, specifically focus on families involved in the 1980s “farm crisis” in the US Midwest, a period where many lost their jobs, land value crashed, and businesses failed — and finds that this financial stress is related to the experience of pain nearly 30 years later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42323&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data was taken from a longitudinal study, which took place over 27 years and involved 508 married couples, who were all in early midlife at the start of the study in 1991.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team tracked a number of measures for the study. A four-item scale measured family financial strain in 1991, 1994 and 2001, and participants also answered items related to financial stress (e.g. “we have enough money to afford the kind of clothing we need”) at the same points. Sense of control was measured ten years apart, in 1991 and 2001, with participants indicating how much they agreed with statements such as “sometimes I feel that I am being pushed around in life”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pain was assessed at two points later on in the study, with participants indicating how much pain they had experienced in the previous month, how severe that pain was, and how much it interfered with life and work. Participants were also presented with a list of nearly 50 physical health conditions and asked to indicate which they had experienced in the last year; these ranged from common colds to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found a correlation between family financial strain and a sense of control at all points — that is, those who experienced financial strain also felt a lack of control over their lives. Financial strain and a feeling of a lack of control at early points of the study were also directly linked to physical pain at later points, indicating that physical pain can be a consequence of stress not just concurrently but many years later. Those with higher family income were less likely to experience physical pain overall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;trajectories&lt;/em&gt; of financial stress over the course of the study were also relevant to the experience of pain. Those who experienced increasing levels of financial strain over the years of the study also experienced a corresponding decline in their sense of control throughout the same period. This was the case even when controlling for other factors, such as age and physical illness, and was also linked to pain at the later points of the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what is actually driving the link between loss of control and physical pain, however. The team has numerous suggestions: for instance, feeling out of control could lead people to make bad decisions that in turn lead to pain or physical ill health. Chronic stress can also cause long-lasting changes in brain circuits involved in our stress response, so neurological processes could also be involved in producing experiences of pain many years after stress was experienced. Future research could explore these possibilities, as well as other drivers of loss of control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are limitations to the findings though. For instance, those with higher family income may have been able to afford better healthcare and make healthier lifestyle choices when it came to diet, exercise, and non-gruelling work practices, which could in turn have made them less likely to experience pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the study does suggest that there is a direct link between loss of control and negative physical and emotional factors. Interventions that increase people’s sense of control may not ameliorate those structural or social factors that cannot be changed, like a poor economy or unemployment, but could go some way to mitigating their physical and emotional impacts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smi.3038&quot;&gt;Midlife family financial strain, sense of control and pain in later years: An investigation of rural husbands and wives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We could all name groups of people who we know to be suffering right now; some in distant countries, some in our own. Research shows that we feel less empathy for people in other countries — and so are less likely to support them by protesting, say, or donating money. Meital Balmas and Eran Halperin at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem now report a factor that can influence this, however: our feelings about the national leader. The pair’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167220987989&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt; suggests that a leader who is perceived as “good” and popular at home elicits more empathy, and even greater tangible help, for their struggling citizens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42281&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across four experiments, participants read fictitious reports about purported leaders in Belgium.  These articles painted the leaders in either a positive or a negative light, focusing on their trustworthiness and warmth (or lack of it), for example. The participants also read about the suffering of Belgian citizens in the wake of a terrorist attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initial studies on Israeli citizens found that when the “prime minister” was described in glowing, rather than negative, terms, participants reported feeling more empathy towards Belgian people, and reported being more willing to help families in distress. A subsequent study found that the perceived popularity of the prime minister was important, however: a PM described as being good and popular boosted empathy, while an unpopular one did not — even if they were described as being good. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team then ran a version of this last study with 304 American adults. The methods were similar, but instead of reading about a terrorist attack, this time participants read about a Belgian teenager who was struggling to cope with the ravages and cost of treatment of his rickets. Repeating the earlier findings, when the country’s prime minister was presented as being popular, the participants exposed to the positive description reported more empathy for the teen and his family than those who’d read the negative report. They also said that they’d be more likely to sign a petition appealing to the Belgian government to help. And, when asked if they’d donate some of their fee for taking part in the study to the teenager and his family, they were more likely to agree.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What should we make of all these findings? “We know that national leaders provide rationale for opinion-building regarding their respective nations and contribute to the stereotyping of their citizens,” the researchers write. And they think this is what explains the results — when we think that a national leader who is a good person is popular, we tend to think that the nation’s people are likely to be good people, too, and we feel more empathy for their distress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The work should have implications for leaders, the researchers think. “In recent decades, not only have national leaders served as main foci of the media coverage of international affairs but nowadays they have followers from all over the world via Twitter,” they write. This puts a “huge responsibility” on their shoulders, they add. “The results of this study show that national leaders are in a position to contribute to better and more empathetic inter-society relations and raise pro-social behaviour around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is an interesting idea. Would people in other countries have felt as much sympathy for the people of Christchurch in the wake of the 2019 shootings, say, if New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern hadn’t seemed like such a good person — and also a popular prime minister? What if she’d more like — well, who? Insert your own least-liked democratically elected leader in that space…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting, though, that of course the country used in this study  —  Belgium — is an open democracy. It might seem reasonable to infer that people who love and elect a “good” person are more likely to be “good” people, too. Unfortunately, of course, a huge amount of human suffering is happening in countries without a democratically elected leader. How that affects our empathy for those citizens is an important question that’s beyond the scope of this study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167220987989&quot;&gt;I Care About Your Plight, But Only If I Like Your Leader: The Effect of National Leaders’ Perceived Personality on Empathy and Pro-Social Behavior Towards Their Citizenry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Aamir Khan will talk about a paper &quot;Study of weak / strong multiplication in gain modulation&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an extension of my previous work on the multiplicative response of
spiking neural networks. In our artificial life platform I evolve a gain
modulated network where there are two Inputs namely d (driving input) and m (
the modulatory input). The network aims for a multiplicative Sigmoidal/gaussian
response modulated by the modulatory input m. The response of the network
exhibits three properties such as 1. Saturation , 2. Non linearity and
3.Multiplicity. The multiplicative capacity of the network varies from strong
to weak in a manner that for some modulatory input there is strong
multiplication and for some there is a weak multiplication, I have
differentiated the response of the network in weak/ strong response. Along with
the classification some further constraints are introduced in the system like
The size of the network tends to be larger i.e 5 nodes, in order to reduce the
size I reward the response of the one interneuron and treat it as the output
node.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, psychologists and neuroscientists have conducted a large number of studies into the effects of psychedelic drugs. Some have sought to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/16/neural-changes-after-taking-psychedelic-drugs-may-reflect-heightened-consciousness/&quot;&gt;better&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/10/psilocybin-alters-brain-levels-of-the-neurotransmitter-glutamate-and-this-could-explain-why-users-experience-ego-dissolution/&quot;&gt;understand&lt;/a&gt; the effects of the drugs in the brain, while others are investigating the potential for substances like psilocybin and LSD &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00187-9&quot;&gt;to treat depression&lt;/a&gt; and other mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This work obviously require tactful communication on the part of researchers: after all, they don’t want to alienate a public who may be at best ambivalent about the use of currently illegal drugs in research or mental health settings. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963662520981728&quot;&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Public Understanding of Science &lt;/em&gt;highlights one thing researchers &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; do: admit to using psychedelic substances themselves. The team finds that researchers who make such a disclosure may be seen by the public as having less integrity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42252&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, Matthias Forstmann at the University of Zurich and Christina Sagioglou at the University of Innsbruck asked 185 participants to read a vignette about a (fictitious) scientist who studies the use of psychedelics to treat mental health disorders, and who has found some promising results regarding the use of psilocybin. Half read that the professor has “extensive personal experience” with the drugs himself, while the others read that he has no such experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All participants then assessed the professor’s scientific integrity, by rating how well he was described by six adjectives such as “professional” and “credible”. They also evaluated the quality of his research, rating it on adjectives like “valid” and “meaningful”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants who had read that the researcher took the drugs himself rated his integrity significantly lower than those who had read he didn’t use them (this was true regardless of whether the participants themselves had experience taking psychedelics). However, this information didn’t influence people’s judgements about the quality of his research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second study replicated the first, with a greater number of participants and more elaborate descriptions of the professor (for instance, participants saw a mock-up of a paper he had supposedly written). Participants were also asked about the &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; of the findings: whether healthcare providers should cover the costs of using psilocybin, for example. Again, those who read that the professor took psychedelics rated his integrity lower, but the two groups didn’t show any difference in their ratings of the quality or value of the work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are a few possible explanations for these results, the team notes. A researcher who studies psychedelics but also uses them might be seen as having a hidden agenda, for instance. Or perhaps it is the illegal nature of his drug use that makes it seem as though the researcher has less integrity. Further work will be needed to tease out these possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s worth pointing out that the difference in integrity ratings wasn’t huge: in the first study, the non-drug-using professor received an average rating of 5.6 on a seven-point scale, compared to a rating of 5 for the researcher who took drugs. Still, the message of the study seems to be that researchers should consider keeping quiet about any drug use in their personal lives — or at least be aware that what they disclose can influence public perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just what researchers themselves say that’s important, but also the context in which the research is presented. In a final study, participants read about a fictitious scientific conference on psychedelic drugs. All were given the same description of the scientific programme, but some read that various social events were happening which had associations with psychedelic culture (e.g. a shamanic drum circle and a psychedelic art exhibition), while the others read about social events which didn’t have these associations (e.g. a tour of a brewery and a postmodern art exhibition).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this case, the association with psychedelic culture did lower participants’ perceptions of the quality of the research (though, interestingly, only among participants who hadn’t used psychedelic drugs themselves). “In order to positively impact the public’s perception of the quality of psychedelic research, it may be sensible to use less stereotypical imagery and language when talking about these substances, be it in media articles or scientific conferences,” the team concludes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963662520981728&quot;&gt;How psychedelic researchers’ self-admitted substance use and their association with psychedelic culture affect people’s perceptions of their scientific integrity and the quality of their research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has already been a month since we &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; we’re launching five new journals. For those of you patiently waiting, we are excited to announce that the journals are now OPEN for submissions! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The responses we’ve seen so far have been overwhelmingly positive. We’d like to say a HUGE THANK YOU to those of you who have expressed your support on social media, via email, and the many hundreds of you who have applied to join the editorial boards of the journals–we have been delighted to see how our reasons for launching them have resonated with you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The journals’ websites now contain much more information on each  journal’s mission, scope, personnel, submission instructions and hopefully everything you need to consider submitting your work:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/climate&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Climate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Sustainability and Transformation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/water&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Digital Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Global Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If what you want to do is explore the journal most relevant to you, and consider it for your future work, please consider this blog post an appropriate “jumping off point” for you to do that! In summary: we have affordable, APC-free business models for all our journals available through institutional partnerships which allow unlimited publishing by all authors at the institution. We also have publishing fees/APCs for those who still need or prefer them, and an established APC-waiver program for those who cannot afford APCs but whose institutions are not yet under an institutional agreement. &lt;strong&gt;Please presume there is a way, that is appropriate for you and your context, that you will be able to publish in these new journals!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those of you who want to know more details about our institutional models, in particular librarians and others managing Open Access budgets, please read &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/open-for-submissions-part-2-models/&quot;&gt;Part 2 of this announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Our five new journals are now &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/open-for-submissions-part-1/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open for Submissions&lt;/a&gt;! This post (Part 2) is specifically geared towards librarians and/or those of you who manage budgets that support Open Access publishing. Or, simply those of you who would like more details about how we are supporting our activities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you have been keeping up to date with our business model innovations, you already know we have been working hard to move beyond the APC to develop more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access. In the past eighteen months we’ve developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flat Fee &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;greements&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Community Action Publishing&lt;/a&gt;. (Please see those links for the full details or recap of those models.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re developing new institutional models to experiment and get things right, and we thank all of you in the library community who have given us feedback. We’re learning that, right now, different types of journals can be better supported by different types of institutional models. Also, we’ve learned that some authors, funders, and countries still prefer APCs due to how they are currently funding or administering their OA publishing. We will continue to support such publication fee models for those who prefer or need them, while continuing to experiment with and develop these new institutional models to make OA work for all authors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutional models for the five new journals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Digital Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; joins the group of journals covered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flat Fee agreements&lt;/a&gt; (covering &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Digital Health, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Sustainability and Transformation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has its own &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Community Action Publishing&lt;/a&gt; setup, similar to &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine, &lt;/em&gt;to showcase how CAP can work for new journals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/climate/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Climate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/water/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Global Public Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; offer a new type of institutional business model, which we are naming the “Global Equity” model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Equity &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our new Global Equity model empowers institutions in every region of the world to provide unlimited Open Access publication support for their authors through a single, annual fee that is affordable and equitably reflects regional economies. The annual fee is based on:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an &lt;strong&gt;institution’s &lt;/strong&gt;research output in the relevant &lt;strong&gt;subject area&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;helping us understand the likely potential to publish in the journal, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the relevant &lt;strong&gt;country’s &lt;/strong&gt;World Bank lending tier (i.e. Low/Low-Middle Income Country (L/LMIC), Upper Middle Income Country (UMIC), High Income Country (HIC). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Global Equity model’s annual price will therefore allow a large institution in a LMIC to pay less than one of comparable size in an HIC, but more than a small institution in an LMIC. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors at institutions in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.research4life.org/access/eligibility/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research4Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (R4L) countries (both group A and group B) can publish for free, regardless of the size of the institution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The following table shows the annual prices for institutions, per journal. Tier 1 is a high output institution in the subject area, to Tier 6 being a low output institution in the subject area. For example, a low output institution in a LMIC interested in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Climate &lt;/em&gt;would pay &lt;strong&gt;$350&lt;/strong&gt; per year to cover unlimited publishing by its authors in that journal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-table&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;has-fixed-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;HIC&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;UMIC&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;L/LMIC&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tier 1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$6,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$5,400&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,100&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tier 2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$4,500&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$4,050&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1,575&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tier 3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$3,750&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$3,375&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1,313&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tier 4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$3,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,700&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1,050&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tier 5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1,800&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$700&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tier 6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$900&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$350&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;R4L&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Global Equity model prices by research output tier and country category&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary Information and Comparison Table&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of you reading this post are likely librarians or other people administering OA budgets. However, if you are an author and are simply interested in submitting to a PLOS journal that is of interest to you, &lt;strong&gt;please presume&lt;/strong&gt; there is a way, &lt;strong&gt;that is appropriate for you and your context&lt;/strong&gt;, that you will be able to publish in these new journals:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If APCs do not work for you and you would like your institution to join any of these institutional agreements, please send your librarian this &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/contact-plos/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, or refer them via this &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/refer/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are a librarian, please contact us via this &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/contact-plos/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If APCs are preferred, or are necessary for you, they are listed in the table below. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/publish/fees/#fee-assistance&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;waiver policies and fee assistance programs&lt;/a&gt; for APCs are unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Below is a table that summarizes the information for our entire portfolio of twelve journals, with the five new journals indicated.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The world is not exactly short of videos of cute cats up to strange antics. But one particular set of videos collected by cat owners during a COVID-19 lockdown reveals something genuinely interesting: a famous optical illusion that fools us also gets cats. The citizen science project, in which cats were experimented on in their own homes, shows that they, too, are tricked by “Kanizsa squares”, an illusion that suggests the presence of a square that doesn’t in fact exist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42227&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s well known that cats love to sit in enclosed spaces, like boxes. They even like to sit in square shapes made of tape, as documented during a 2017 Twitter craze (#CatSquare). So in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159121001258?dgcid=coauthor&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Applied Animal Behaviour Science&lt;/em&gt;, Gabriella E. Smith at City University of New York and colleagues took this further, to see if cats also show a preference for illusory squares.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of the 500 pet cats and owners who signed up to take part, 30 completed all the trials. The owners “were not aware of the study’s investigative purpose at any point before or during the experiment”, the authors write. (Well, they weren’t told what it was about, at least.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every day for six days, each owner put their cat out of the room while they taped a pair of stimuli to the floor. The researchers instructed them each day on which two of three stimuli to use: an actual square, a Kanizsa square (in which four Pacman-type cut-outs are arranged to suggest the lines of a square) and the Kanizsa control (in which the Pacman-type cut-outs face the other way.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-42231&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;42231&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;0&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Smith-et-al-2021&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Smith-et-al-2021.png?fit=845%2C508&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Smith-et-al-2021.png?fit=300%2C180&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Smith-et-al-2021.png?fit=875%2C526&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;875,526&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/05/24/cats-like-to-sit-in-squares-even-ones-that-are-really-optical-illusions/smith-et-al-2021/&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;505&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Smith-et-al-2021.png?resize=842%2C505&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; width=&quot;842&quot; /&gt;Examples of Kanizsa squares (right) paired with the Kanizsa control (top panel) and actual square (bottom panel). &lt;em&gt;Via &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159121001258?dgcid=coauthor&quot;&gt;Smith et al (2021)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The owner then put on sunglasses (so their cat couldn’t use their gaze as a cue to what to do), brought the cat into the room, and started videoing. If, within five minutes, their pet sat or stood within either of the shapes, the trial ended. Either way, after five minutes, they submitted the result.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of those 30 cats who completed all the trials, nine cats chose to inside a stimulus at least once — and, in total between them, 16 times. On eight of these occasions, a cat sat inside an actual square. On seven, it sat inside a Kanizsa square. In contrast, the Kanizsa control was chosen only once. This suggests that cats treat the Kanizsa squares just like real ones. Like us (and dogs, chimps, and many other animals, in fact) they show “susceptibility to illusory contours.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recruiting pet owners to do experiments themselves clearly has some downsides. Very few of those who signed up actually completed the full study. Also, light levels might have varied quite a bit across the various homes, and this could have influenced the cats’ decisions, the team notes. However, there are also good reasons to study cats in their own homes, rather than a lab. As they’re more relaxed at home, their behaviour is likely to be more natural.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study provides further evidence that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/09/heres-the-first-evidence-that-even-lizards-succumb-to-optical-illusions/&quot;&gt;animals experience all kinds of illusions&lt;/a&gt;. But it also gives further insight into cat cognition, which has received little attention compared to that of dogs. Quite why not isn’t clear. However, given the useful, if limited, data from this new study, the researchers write: “the use of citizen science as a precursor to in-lab investigations of cat cognition could greatly help bridge this divide.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159121001258?dgcid=coauthor&quot;&gt;If I fits I sits: A citizen science investigation into illusory contour susceptibility in domestic cats (&lt;em&gt;Felis silvestris catus&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is ample evidence that inequality exists — in the UK alone, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2021/jan/03/richest-1-have-almost-a-quarter-of-uk-wealth-study-claims&quot;&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; suggested, the richest 1% have a quarter of the country’s wealth, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/race-report-statistics&quot;&gt;marginalised groups experience inequality&lt;/a&gt; in relation to work, education, living standards, healthcare &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lse.ac.uk/gender/assets/documents/research/gender-inequality-and-power-commission/Confronting-Gender-Inequality-blue.pdf&quot;&gt;and more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, not everyone is attentive to inequality. While some are keenly focused on its causes and its solutions, others believe it’s simply not important, or at the very least that it’s exaggerated. So what determines whether we pay attention to inequality?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/14/e2023985118&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, argues that our ideological stance on equality may be key. Unsurprisingly, the team finds that social egalitarians were more likely to notice signs of inequality — but only when it affected certain groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42180&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 2,204 participants were shown a series of photographs depicting urban scenes, half of which contained indications of inequality such as wealthy women receiving pedicures or &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/14/visible-reminders-of-inequality-can-raise-support-for-taxing-the-wealthy/&quot;&gt;luxury cars&lt;/a&gt;. Participants were then asked what they had noticed in the images, with no mention of inequality in the prompt. Finally, they completed a survey that measured their levels of social egalitarianism — that is, how much they prioritise social equality — indicating how much they agreed with statements like “Some groups of people must be kept in their place”. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those with low levels of social egalitarianism were significantly less likely to specifically mention inequality or to mention the inequality-related indicators. Social egalitarians, on the other hand, were more likely to mention inequality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As it was not clear whether those with low levels of social egalitarianism were noticing but failing to mention inequality or simply not seeing it at all, the second study focused on the detection of inequality. Participants viewed a series of pairs of images, one depicting a group of men and the other a group of women, each accompanied by a set of money bags. In equal trials, men and women had the same number of money bags, while in unequal trials the men were shown with more. Participants had to indicate whether the images depicted equal or unequal distribution of resources. Those high in social egalitarianism were more accurate at the task than those with low levels, suggesting that anti-egalitarians are less likely to notice inequality as well as less likely to mention it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each study so far had explored attention to inequality experienced by particularly marginalised groups such as women. So, in the next study, the team looked at whether social egalitarians were also better at noticing inequality against socially &lt;em&gt;advantaged&lt;/em&gt; groups, too. Participants watched a video of a discussion panel, made up of two men and two women. In one condition, the men spoke one and a half times longer than the women, and in the other the women spoke one and a half times longer than the men. Participants were then asked whether men or women had spent more time speaking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Social egalitarians were more likely to accurately notice when men spoke more than women; but when women spoke more than men, there was no significant difference between egalitarian and anti-egalitarian participants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the final study, participants were privy to a hiring process in which the employer was either biased against minorities or against white applicants. And as in the previous studies, social egalitarians were significantly more likely to notice bias against racial minorities, but less likely to notice bias against white candidates. Anti-egalitarians, however, were more likely to notice the anti-white bias.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, the results suggest, social egalitarians are more attentive to social inequality against marginalised groups, and less likely to notice disadvantages against less marginalised groups like men or white people. (Another study conducted earlier this year similarly found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/04/advocates-of-equality-for-all-are-more-likely-to-show-prejudice-against-older-adults-at-work/&quot;&gt;egalitarians were more likely to show prejudice against older people at work&lt;/a&gt;, particularly older white men).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, it’s worth remembering that inequalities against marginalised groups are structural and wide-ranging, significantly affecting millions of people on an everyday basis. For more advantaged groups, like white men, disadvantages are on a smaller scale — speaking less than women on a panel, to use an example from the study, is hardly a serious social inequality. In this respect, it makes sense that those concerned with social inequality focus their attention on those groups who are most affected by it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say that there aren’t areas in which men in particular are disadvantaged — male &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/01/male-suicide-rate-england-wales-covid-19&quot;&gt;suicide rates,&lt;/a&gt; for example, are extremely concerning. Further research could benefit from comparing more serious examples like this, where social egalitarians may be more attentive, rather than with small-scale issues like panel discussions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/14/e2023985118&quot;&gt;Ideology selectively shapes attention to inequality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The COVID-19 pandemic caused an outbreak of scientific evidence. As of April 2021, the number of unique publications indexed by our &lt;a href=&quot;https://zika.ispm.unibe.ch/assets/data/pub/search_beta/&quot;&gt;living evidence database&lt;/a&gt;, created to retrieve COVID-19 publications, exceeded 160,000. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01244-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;our research&lt;/a&gt;, we compared the patterns of scientific publications for the two infections, the Zika virus emergence in 2016 and SARS-CoV-2, to assess the evolution of the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The living evidence database was created initially for retrieving publications on Zika virus. In 2016, we included around 50-60 new Zika virus articles per week in our database. We thought it would be an easy transition to switch to indexing COVID-19 articles in late 2019. However, we were shocked by the sheer volume of published articles retrieved, which came to around 2,500 articles per week at the end of April 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the evidence evaluation for Zika virus, we identified and classified 2,286 publications in 2016. However, for SARS-CoV-2, although we recruited a group of international volunteer scientists with a background in health sciences to cope with the volume, we were only able to analyze a random sample of 5,294 (24%) out of 21,990 articles that were published before 24 May 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A substantial proportion of articles indexed were non-original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;Our findings showed that a substantial proportion of articles indexed were non-original (commentaries, basic reviews, opinion papers, etc.) for both Zika virus (55%) and SARS-CoV-2 (34%, [95% Confidence interval (Cl): 33-35]). The role of preprints was more prominent at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic than the Zika virus epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case reports and case series accounted for approximately 10% of the total body of evidence for both SARS-CoV-2 (10.7% [95% CI: 9.9-11.6]) and Zika virus (9.7%) research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case-control and cohort studies accounted for 4.0% [95% CI: 3.5-4.6] for SARS-CoV-2 and 0.8% for Zika virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trials emerged in smaller numbers (27/5,294 for SARS -CoV-2, and 1/2,286 for Zika virus) and at the beginning of the outbreak, there were more mathematical modelling studies for SARS-CoV-2 (10.1%, [95% CI: 9.3-11.0]), when compared with Zika virus (3.2%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-study type trends&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Case reports, case series and cross-sectional studies were the first epidemiological study designs to be reported, together with non-original articles and reviews. Case-control and cohort studies followed later; this delay was more prominent in the Zika virus research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; laboratory studies followed between case reports and controlled observational studies. Trials were the last type of study to be published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it all mean?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Emerging infectious diseases are accompanied by a vast quantity of published evidence quickly, which is a significant challenge that clinicians, scientists, researchers, and even students have to face. Keeping up with the available evidence becomes a complicated task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed of SARS-CoV-2 evidence accumulation was unprecedented. Although we recruited a large team of experienced scientists, we reached a point where we could not categorize all the evidence retrieved by our database within the first few months of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tackle this issue, we believe the use of natural language processing methods to help classify and categorize evidence seems like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0895-4356(17)30604-2&quot;&gt;promising approach for the triage of publication&lt;/a&gt; types not only for SARS-CoV-2 but for future emerging diseases. Also, collaborative crowd-sourcing within scientists in the field could increase researchers’ efficiency and &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(13)62329-6&quot;&gt;prevent research waste&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assessing the evidence during emerging infections can help us identify which types of public health questions we can answer and when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessing the evidence during emerging infections can help us identify which types of public health questions we can answer and when. Further research on evidence evaluation during emerging outbreaks could help improve the public health response. With the accumulation of evidence during particular situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of specific resources can save time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the amount of evidence published every day on this non-ending pandemic, students, clinicians, and stakeholders need to approach the published studies with caution. Some of the studies available might be providing wrong findings or conclusions, and people might ‘cherry pick’ what aligns with their beliefs. We need critical eyes to scrutinize all available evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Shabnam Kadir will talk about a paper &quot;Feasibility of Topological Data Analysis for Event-Related fMRI&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent fMRI research shows that perceptual and cognitive representations are
instantiated in high-dimensional multivoxel patterns in the brain. However, the
methods for detecting these representations are limited. Topological data
analysis (TDA) is a new approach, based on the mathematical field of topology,
that can detect unique types of geometric features in patterns of data. Several
recent studies have successfully applied TDA to study various forms of neural
data; however, to our knowledge, TDA has not been successfully applied to data
from event-related fMRI designs. Event-related fMRI is very common but limited
in terms of the number of events that can be run within a practical time frame
and the effect size that can be expected. Here, we investigate whether
persistent homology- a popular TDA tool that identifies topological
features in data and quantifies their robustness- can identify known
signals given these constraints. We use fmrisim, a Python-based simulator of
realistic fMRI data, to assess the plausibility of recovering a simple
topological representation under a variety of conditions. Our results suggest
that persistent homology can be used under certain circumstances to recover
topological structure embedded in realistic fMRI data simulations.How do we
represent the world? In cognitive neuroscience it is typical to think
representations are points in high-dimensional space. In order to study these
kinds of spaces it is necessary to have tools that capture the organization of
high- dimensional data. Topological data analysis (TDA) holds promise for
detecting unique types of geometric features in patterns of data. Although
potentially useful, TDA has not been applied to event-related fMRI data. Here
we utilized a popular tool from TDA, persistent homology, to recover
topological signals from event-related fMRI data. We simulated realistic fMRI
data and explored the parameters under which persistent homology can
successfully extract signal. We also provided extensive code and
recommendations for how to make the most out of TDA for fMRI analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>https://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=42159</id>
		<updated>2021-05-19T10:57:14+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three people are walking down the street, two women and one man. One of the women trips and falls. Which of the two observers will feel more empathy for her pain? Hundreds of studies suggest that it’ll be the woman. However, these results almost overwhelmingly come from self-reports. Objective evidence that women genuinely feel more empathy than men is very thin on the ground. This has led to the idea that women report more empathy not because they actually feel it but to conform to societal expectations that they should. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87214-x&quot;&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; claims to provide evidence that, even when they think no one else is looking or asking, girls show more empathy than boys.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42159&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Joyce F Benenson at the University of Quebec and colleagues set up pairs of 5- to 7-year-old children, so that one member of the pair would suffer a misfortune, and the other would witness it. The members of each of the 32 female pairs and 23 male pairs knew each other, but weren’t considered by their teachers to be best friends or enemies. (The researchers sex-matched the pairs because earlier studies have suggested that we feel more empathy for people of the same sex — so any sex difference in empathy should be easier to spot.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each pair was taken to a room in their own school. It was empty but for two baskets of plastic building blocks by the entrance, and a table at the far end. The children were asked if they’d be willing to take the blocks to the table and build a tower. (The somewhat elaborate full story involved alien children who needed to contact their parents; the children all seemed to want to take part, the researchers report.) Before leaving the room, the experimenter did warn them that one basket was a little broken, so if a child found that their blocks fell, they should just pick up them up with their hands and carry them over to the table. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hidden cameras then recorded what happened when the researchers remote-operated one of the baskets to split, causing that child’s bricks to tumble out. The team focused on the other child’s reactions, and rated them according to four “empathy indicators”: looking at the victim for more than three seconds; ceasing their own activity for longer than a second; ceasing their activity until the other child had placed a block on the tower; and actively intervening by picking up the basket or blocks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eight of the girls, and none of the boys, engaged in all four behaviours (though seven girls and five boys did not engage in any at all). Overall, significantly more girls than boys looked at the victim for more than three seconds and gave them chance to recover before placing their own block. The female bystanders “exhibited more empathic behaviour than male bystanders”, the team concluded, adding: “It is highly likely that females do experience greater feelings of empathy which motivate them to behave in ways that display more concern for victims.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is possible. It could be that, as the researchers argue, they have found behavioural indicators of sex differences in empathy. But there are other potential explanations. It might be that girls are more patient than boys, or more agreeable (there is research finding that girls and women tend to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Overlapping-distributions-of-Agreeableness-for-men-and-women-Vertical-axis-indicates_fig10_51594567&quot;&gt;score higher on this personality trait&lt;/a&gt; than males), or that the boys were more competitive and prioritised getting on with building over acting on whatever empathy they felt for their partner. In fact, the majority of boys did pause whatever they were doing following the accident. Most didn’t show other “empathic activities”, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they weren’t feeling the same empathy for their unlucky partners as the girls. Perhaps girls really do feel more empathy, but it’s not possible to conclude that from this study.       &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87214-x&quot;&gt;Girls exhibit greater empathy than boys following a minor accident&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;Red sign with slogan 'Keep calm and stay home'&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12397 alignright&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/30140872-278x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;246&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;In an interesting analysis, researchers from Technical University in Munich and the University of Cambridge investigated the difference in the response to COVID-19 pandemic between Germany and UK residents. Their findings (published now in &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychology&lt;/em&gt;) highlight a striking discrepancy how responders from both countries rated the impact of the pandemic on their financial situation as well as their personal outlook: While German participants reported a lower impact in terms of loss of work and income, they were less hopeful that the pandemic would end soon compared with British participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, both populations showed an increase in symptoms of mental illnesses, most prominently depression and anxieties, induced or worsened by the pandemic. This alarming increase calls for a better public awareness of mental health and mental illness as well as better access to help in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comparison between Germany and the UK is particularly interesting because both countries are economically and culturally very similar. However, the initial response to the pandemic differed between both countries, with Germany locking down considerably earlier than the UK, which has been shown to have impacted number of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the data for this study was collected during the first lockdown in both countries (April/May 2020) it will be interesting to see how the mental health response has changed over the course of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-021-00620-8?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Medical Ethics – Research integrity, misconduct and consequences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Research ethics is a hot topic not only in the science community but is also garnering wide-spread attention among the public. Especially in recent years, cases of prominent researchers suspected of misconduct have been highly publicised across news outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12396&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12396 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-1033540402-1-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;© Warchi / Getty Images / iStock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;In a recent study published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Ethics&lt;/em&gt;, researchers from Hungary, Ireland, the UK and Norway collected and analysed data concerning cases of research misconduct available in scientific journals. Interestingly, the field of natural sciences (41.5%) was found to have the most cases in relation to number of publications in the field, followed by health and medical sciences (25.1%) and engineering (22%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The most prevalent misconduct category was fabrication and falsification of data with non-adherence to pertinent laws such as informed consent and ethics approval ranking second. Additionally, the researchers assessed the consequences for research misconduct finding paper retraction (45.4%) and exclusion from funding applications (35.5%) to be the most common sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The authors of this study further criticise that retraction notices often do not contain sufficient detail, thus impeding transparency of the retraction process. Comprehensive analyses such as this study guide the research community in finding ways to prevent misconduct and upholding research integrity standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01268-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Medical Research Methodology – Equity in clinical trial registration – Why are places of higher disease prevalence not (yet) aligned with trial locations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Clinical trials aimed to investigate treatment options for specific illnesses often do not recruit from populations with high prevalence of the respective disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12398&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Group of healthcare workers and patients of different ages and ethnicities in a huddle all with hands in smiling at the hospital.&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12398&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-1141832721-1-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;© Hispanolistic / Getty Images / iStock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;This geographical mismatch affects both the quality of care and the validity or generalisability of results and funding bodies are working towards a more equal distribution. Researchers and funding bodies are becoming increasingly aware of these issues, prompting researchers from the University of Oxford to investigate why this mismatch exists and how chief investigators (CIs) of clinical trials can be supported to achieve a more equitable distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The results of their qualitative study have now been published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Research Methodology&lt;/em&gt; revealing that the main factors in site selection for CIs is to ensure a successful trial procedure and the risk associated with choosing less research-active sites. Mainly, CIs are conscious of potential issues with patient recruitment and retention and are concerned with the effect a less successful trial might have on their reputation and future funding opportunities. This often leads to CIs selecting sites where they have a personal contact or with which they have collaborated in the past, thereby perpetuating this system of inequity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The authors suggest strategies to mitigate these perceived risk factors and incentivise chief investigators to align their research sites with the location of disease prevalence while highlighting the benefits experienced by CIs who have previously ‘broken the mould’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-021-05552-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Research Notes – Reforesting our planet using nitrogen-fixing legumes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Awareness of the importance of the tropical rain forests and forests in general for our global climate has grown over the last few years and forest restoration is crucial in our efforts to prevent a climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Reforestation programmes are on the rise, but a main hindrance to restoring a diverse plant life are often depleted soils that have lost nutrients and minerals through monocultural farming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12399&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Hand of a farmer nurturing a young green plant with natural green background .&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12399&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-614115058-1-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;© weerapatkiatdumrong / Getty Images / iStock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Brazilian researchers present data on the use of different legume plants in restoration efforts, published now in &lt;em&gt;BMC Research Notes&lt;/em&gt;. Nitrogen-fixing legumes are a useful tool to restore soils and offer a good basis for second-generation plants, but the process is often slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By measuring biomass growth of reforestation blocks treated with different fertilisation regimens, the researchers were able to show a fundamental role for additional fertilisation during the early stages of plantation development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings will be important for policymakers in setting up strategies to mitigate global warming and retrieve carbon from our atmosphere using natural fixation by plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12400&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Problem child and desperate mother at psychological centre.&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12400&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-639794730-1-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;© KatarzynaBialasiewicz / Getty Images / iStock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-021-02631-1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder leading to learning disabilities or social dysfunction in affected children with symptoms often lasting into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Previous research has shown that children with ADHD often have lower serum levels of vitamin D and magnesium, but few studies have been conducted to assess the effect of vitamin D/magnesium supplementation on behavioural issues of children diagnosed with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;In a study published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt; Hemamy and colleagues present data from a randomised, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of vitamin D/Mg supplementation on Iranian children with ADHD. Interestingly, the researchers find significant improvement in several behavioural variables including emotional and peer problems, where children in the treatment group scored significantly better than those receiving a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;This research lays the groundwork for bigger clinical trials investigating the impact of vitamin D and magnesium on the behaviour of children with ADHD as well as the underlying physiological mechanism leading to potentially new treatment recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are our personalities set in stone, or can we choose to change them? &lt;/strong&gt;In this bonus episode, Matthew Warren talks to former &lt;em&gt;Research Digest&lt;/em&gt; editor &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt; about his new book &lt;em&gt;Be Who You Want: Unlocking the Science of Personality Change&lt;/em&gt;. Christian discusses the evidence-based methods you can use to alter your personality, whether you’re an introvert who wants to become the life of the party, or you simply wish you were a little more open to new experiences. He also explains how our personalities evolve over the course of our lifespans, even when we’re not consciously trying to change them, and ponders how they might be affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be Who You Want: Unlocking the Science of Personality Change&lt;/em&gt; is out on May 18th in the United States and May 20th in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/Module-1-screenshot-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few institutions provide training on strategies for increasing diversity among clinical trial participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many research teams struggle to recruit racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials, despite increasing awareness of the need for diversity. Unfortunately, few institutions provide training for research teams on strategies for increasing diversity among clinical trial participants. To address this need, we developed a massive open online course, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/recruitment-minorities-clinical-trials&quot;&gt;Faster Together&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the course is to help individuals involved in the clinical research enterprise (including investigators, recruiters, and clinical research coordinators), gain the knowledge and skills needed to successfully recruit and retain racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01240-x&quot;&gt;our manuscript&lt;/a&gt;, we describe the design, implementation, and initial evaluation results based on the ten-month period since the course was released. Briefly, the course was developed through a collaborative process involving a team of content experts, knowledge management information scientists, and videographers. Community feedback was incorporated throughout the course development process through consultation with the Recruitment Innovation Center Community Advisory Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/recruitment-minorities-clinical-trials&quot;&gt;course&lt;/a&gt; consists of eight modules, which can each be completed within an hour. The individual modules are divided into short (~10 minute) segments to try to make it easier for learners to complete the training when they have available time. The modules focus on topics including understanding the need for diversity in clinical research, barriers and facilitators to participation, community engagement strategies, pre-screening, consent, and retention. The course content is freely available, and learners can work at their own pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, feedback from course participants has been positive, and participants have indicated that the course increased their knowledge of the topic. It remains to be seen whether participation in the course will translate to changes in minority enrollment in clinical trials. However, the majority of learners in our study reported that they intended to alter their recruitment practices as a result of their course participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training on its own will not lead to changes, unless supplemented by actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that initiatives such as our course will ultimately result in more equitable representation of minorities in clinical trials. Achieving diversity in research participation is necessary to be able to understand whether the findings of a given study will be relevant for different populations. We recognize that training on its own will not lead to changes, unless supplemented by actions. Changes may be needed at the individual, team, and institutional levels. Responding to the call for increased diversity in clinical trial participation is one of many critical steps we can take to help reduce health disparities and promote health equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;To infer spike rates from calcium imaging data for a time point &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;, knowledge about the calcium signal both before and after time &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; is required. Our algorithm &lt;em&gt;Cascade&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;) uses by default a window that is symmetric in time and feeds this window into a small deep network to use the data points in the window for spike inference (schematic below taken from Fig. 2A of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt;; CC-BY-NC 4.0):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6807&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6807&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;figure-2a_mod&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-2a_mod.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-2a_mod.png?w=215&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-2a_mod.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;956,1331&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/figure-2a_mod/&quot; height=&quot;483&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-2a_mod.png?w=735&quot; width=&quot;347&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, if one wants to perform spike inference not as a post-processing step but rather during the experiment (“online spike inference”), it would be ideal to perform spike inference with a delay as short as possible. This would allow for example to use the result of spike inference for a closed-loop interaction with the animal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ringachlab.net/&quot;&gt;Dario Ringach&lt;/a&gt; recently came up with this interesting problem. With the Cascade algorithm already set up, I was curious to check very specifically: How many time points (i.e., imaging frames) are required after time point &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; to perform reliable spike inference?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using GCaMP/mouse datasets from the large ground truth database (the database is again described in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt;), I addressed this question directly by training separate models. For each model, the time window was shifted such that a variable number of data points (between minimally 1 and maximally 32) were used for spike inference. Everything was evaluated at a typical frame rate of 30 Hz, and also at different noise levels of the recordings (color-coded below); a noise level of “2” is pretty decent, while a noise level of “8” is quite noisy – explained with examples (Fig. S3) and equations (Methods) again in the preprint.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6810&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6810&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;figure-1-2&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;869,726&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/figure-1-2/&quot; height=&quot;264&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png?w=869&quot; width=&quot;317&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results are quite clear: For low noise levels (black curve, SEM across datasets as corridor), spike inference seems to reach a saturating performance (correlation with ground truth spike rates) around a value of almost 8 frames. This would result in a delay of almost 8*33 ms ≈ 260 ms after a spiking event (dashed line).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But let’s have a closer look. The above curve was averaged across 8 datasets, mixing different indicators (GCaMP6f and GCaMP6s) and induction methods (transgenic mouse lines and AAV-based induction). Below, I looked into the curve for each single dataset (for the noise level of 2).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is immediately clear that for some datasets fewer frames after &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; are sufficient for almost optimal spike inference, for others not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6812&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6812&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;figure-1-3&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;2022,665&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/figure-1-3/&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png?w=1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the best datasets, optimal performance is already reached with 4 frames (left panel; delay of ca. 120 ms). These are datasets #10 and #11, which use the fast indicator GCaMP6f, which in addition is here transgenically expressed. The corresponding spike-triggered linear kernels (right side; copied from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2&quot;&gt;Fig. S1 of the preprint&lt;/a&gt;) are indeed faster than for other datasets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two datasets with GCaMP6s (datasets #15 and #16) stand out as non-ideal, requiring almost 16 frames after &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; before optimal performance is reached. Probably, expression levels in these experiment using AAV-based approaches were very high, resulting in &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2018.09.005&quot;&gt;calcium buffering&lt;/a&gt; and therefore slower transients. The corresponding spike-triggered linear kernels are indeed much slower than for the other GCaMP6s- or GCaMP6f-based datasets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The script used to perform the above evaluations can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade/blob/master/etc/Evaluate_delay_online_spike_inference.py&quot;&gt;Cascade’s Github repository&lt;/a&gt;. Since each data point requires retraining the model from scratch, it cannot be run on a CPU in reasonable time. On a RTX 2080 Ti, the script took 2-3 days to complete.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; Only few frames (down to 4 frames) after time&lt;em&gt; t&lt;/em&gt; are sufficient to perform almost ideal spike inference. This is probably a consequence of the fact that the sharp step increase is more informative than the slow decay of a spike-triggered event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To optimize the experiment for online spike-inference, it is helpful to use a fast indicator (e.g., GCaMP6f). It also seems that transgenic expression might be an advantage, since indicator expression and calcium buffering is typically lower for transgenic expression than for viral induction, preventing a slow-down of the indicator by overexpression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce our collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://paperswithcode.com/&quot;&gt;Papers With Code&lt;/a&gt; to support links to datasets on &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning articles on arXiv now have a Code &amp;amp; Data tab to link to datasets that are used or introduced in a paper. Readers can activate Links to Code &amp;amp; Data from the paper abstract page to see links to official code, community implementations of the code, and the datasets used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_979&quot; style=&quot;width: 400px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot of links to datasets from arXiv abstract pages&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-979 size-full&quot; height=&quot;539&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/PwC-Data-Screen-Shot-2021-05-10-at-4.00.24-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;From the “Code &amp;amp; Data” tab on the arXiv article abstract page, readers can find links to datasets used in the paper.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors can add datasets to their arXiv papers by going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/login&quot;&gt;arxiv.org/user&lt;/a&gt; and clicking on the “Link to code &amp;amp; data” Papers with Code icon (see below). From there they will be directed to Papers with Code where they can add their datasets. Once added, these will show on the arXiv article’s abstract page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes tracking dataset usage across the community and quickly finding other papers using the same dataset easier. From Papers with Code, readers can discover other papers using the same dataset, track usage over time, compare models, and find similar datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All data on Papers with Code is freely available and is licensed under CC-BY-SA (same as Wikipedia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An arXivLabs Collaboration&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv’s mission is to provide an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant, emerging science and establish their contribution to advancing research. Datasets are a critical component of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second stage of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/28/arxivlabs-a-space-for-community-innovation/&quot;&gt;arXivLabs collaboration&lt;/a&gt; with Papers with Code, following &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/08/new-arxivlabs-feature-provides-instant-access-to-code/&quot;&gt;the introduction of code on arXiv&lt;/a&gt; last October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Members of our community want to contribute tools that enhance the arXiv experience, and we value that kind of community engagement,” said Eleonora Presani, arXiv Executive Director.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Author: &lt;strong&gt;Roheena Anand&lt;/strong&gt;, Director, Global Publishing Development, PLOS&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago we &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; five new journals and their role in our plans to spread our roots deeper and absorb researchers and local practices more fully into our business. However, this is only one part of our work in this area. In the transition to an Open future we need to keep asking ourselves “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/theme-of-2019-international-open-access-week-to-be-open-for-whom-&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open for Whom?&lt;/a&gt;” Openness in itself, while valuable, does not tackle inequality in the scholarly communications ecosystem, or increase inclusion.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we need to be intentional in addressing power imbalances and the legacy of devaluing knowledge from particular groups or regions, e.g. from communities often marginalized in North American/Western European publications, including researchers from Low-to-Middle-Income countries. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this year we will be expanding our presence into different continents, embedding ourselves into local communities to work alongside them, listening and learning, so that we can understand and reflect their needs and values.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today&lt;/strong&gt;, as our first major step, we’re sharing the wonderful news that we are formally partnering with the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tcc-africa.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Training Centre in Communication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, based in the University of Nairobi, Kenya, commonly known as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tcc-africa.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TCC Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. TCC Africa is a nonprofit trust that has been doing valuable work across the continent since 2006. They’re committed to improving African researchers’ visibility (and therefore impact) through training in scholarly communication. Like us, they are heavily invested in an Open future and work with stakeholders across the scholarly communication ecosystem to promote and increase uptake of open access and open science more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Working with TCC Africa will help us to ensure that the interests and values of African research communities are represented in PLOS publications, policies, and services and to ensure that Open Science practices work for local stakeholders. We believe that all Open Science and Open Research activities should be informed and co-created by local communities at a global scale, helping us all to rebuild the system better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve started to build our strategic plan to achieve our joint goals: it’s the first step on our path to a more inclusive Open Science future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please follow PLOS and TCC Africa on social media, and/or follow our blogs, to keep up to date on the progress of this partnership!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Nik Dennler will talk about a paper &quot;Event-Driven Sensing for Efficient Perception: Vision and Audition Algorithms&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event sensors implement circuits that capture partial functionality of
biological sensors, such as the retina and cochlea. As with their
biological counterparts, event sensors are drivers of their own
output. That is, they produce dynamically sampled binary events to
dynamically changing stimuli. Algorithms and networks that process
this form of output representation are still in their infancy, but
they show strong promise. This article illustrates the unique form of
the data produced by the sensors and demonstrates how the properties
of these sensor outputs make them useful for power-efficient,
low-latency systems working in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2021/05/12/10-years-of-brainhack-an-open-inclusive-culture-for-neuro-tool-developers-at-all-levels/"/>

		<updated>2021-05-12T09:53:12+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Brainhacks and similar formats are increasingly recognized as a new way of providing academic training and conducting research that extends traditional settings. There is a new paper out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(21)00231-2&quot;&gt;in Neuron&lt;/a&gt;, by 200+ authors, describing the format and what makes it valuable to the community. This post aims to highlight some of the core themes of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brainhacks have been held since 2012, organized by local communities, sometimes in sync with other hackathons taking place elsewhere. In 2016 the format developed into the Brainhack Global – a synchronous swarm of hybrid meetings arranged by local communities with local and virtual participants. In 2020, during the pandemic, the BG went fully virtual.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QyhV2wtej9eq5z6i1cL-fT0EGPWLrwHdjZgIbB08cnLkFLkQhWFXRyCzbzKWM52ah7uOSEJrmnbD2CSdk-Y1sDM8LsJMaaAeN_PUF_c57duNgo-8PomZvXEhqgtPsni1GdRN7VXq&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Figure 1D from &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.04.001&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.04.001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A similar growth of hackathons has occurred in communities adjacent to Brainhack. INCF started funding hackathons early because our community asked for it; and when we saw the value and inspiration hackathons brought to the community, it became a regular line item in the INCF budget. Since funding our first hackathon in 2012, we have funded or partially funded at least one hackathon each year (see our entry in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainhack.org/brainhack_jupyter_book/acknowledgments.html&quot;&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Brainhack format is inspired by the hackathon model and centers on ad-hoc, informal collaborations for building, updating and extending community software tools developed by the participants’ peers, with the goal to have functioning software by the end of the event. Unlike many hackathons, Brainhacks welcome participants from all disciplines and with any level of experience—from those who have never written a line of code to software developers and expert neuroscientists, and also feature informal dissemination of ongoing research through unconferences. Also unlike some traditional hackathons, Brainhacks do not have competitions. Brainhacks value education; recent major Brainhack events even have a TrainTrack, a set of entirely education-focused sessions that run in parallel with regular hacking on projects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;The five defining Brainhack features: &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;1) a project-oriented approach that fosters active participation and community-driven problem-solving&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2) learning by doing, which enables participants to gain more intensive training, particularly in computational methods&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3) training in open science and collaborative coding, which helps participants become more effective collaborators&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;4) focus on reproducibility, which leads to more robust scientific research; and &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;5) accelerated building and bridging of communities, which encourages inclusivity and seamless collaboration between researchers at different career stages&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brainhacks have increased insight in the value of tool usability and reusability and the need for long-term maintenance; shifting community culture from individuals creating tools for their own needs to a community actively contributing to an existing resource. They also help to disseminate good practices for writing code and documentation, ensuring code readability, using version control and licensing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brainhacks promote awareness of reproducible practices that integrate easily into research workflows, and show the value of data sharing and open data. They introduce participants to data standards, such as BIDS, allowing them to experience the benefits of a unified data organization and provides them with the skillset to use these formats in their own research. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brainhacks create a scientific culture around open and standardized data, metadata, and methods, as well as detailed documentation and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Brainhack community are currently also working to collate Brainhack-related insights and expertise into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainhack.org/brainhack_jupyter_book/&quot;&gt;Jupyter Book &lt;/a&gt; that will serve as a centralized set of resources for the community.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Maria Psarrou will talk about a paper &quot;Fast Odour Dynamics Are Encoded in the Olfactory System and Guide Behaviour&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odours are transported in turbulent plumes, which result in rapid concentration
fluctuations that contain rich information about the olfactory scenery, such as
the composition and location of an odour source. However, it is unclear whether
the mammalian olfactory system can use the underlying temporal structure to
extract information about the environment. Here we show that ten-millisecond
odour pulse patterns produce distinct responses in olfactory receptor neurons.
In operant conditioning experiments, mice discriminated temporal correlations
of rapidly fluctuating odours at frequencies of up to 40 Hz. In imaging and
electrophysiological recordings, such correlation information could be readily
extracted from the activity of mitral and tufted cells the output neurons of
the olfactory bulb. Furthermore, temporal correlation of odour concentrations
reliably predicted whether odorants emerged from the same or different sources
in naturalistic environments with complex airflow. Experiments in which mice
were trained on such tasks and probed using synthetic correlated stimuli at
different frequencies suggest that mice can use the temporal structure of
odours to extract information about space. Thus, the mammalian olfactory system
has access to unexpectedly fast temporal features in odour stimuli. This endows
animals with the capacity to overcome key behavioural challenges such as odour
source separation, figure ground segregation and odour localization by
extracting information about space from temporal odour dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A chemistry professor at Northeastern University in Boston, MA who has almost 70 papers flagged on PubPeer resigned yesterday, May 4, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On his blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://forbetterscience.com/2020/03/19/thomas-webster-to-save-the-world-with-covid-19-nanoparticles/&quot;&gt;For Better Science&lt;/a&gt; (Update May 5, at the bottom), Leonid Schneider shared an email from the Chair of the Department of Engineering, which states that Thomas J Webster has resigned from the university. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Webster has &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Thomas+J+Webster%22&quot;&gt;69 papers flagged on PubPeer&lt;/a&gt;, mostly for concerns about image irregularities. I reported 59 to the journals and institution in March 2020. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-2562&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of these papers, which appeared to have duplications of features within the same photo, were quietly corrected. Perhaps coincidentally, these had been published in the  Elsevier journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.elsevier.com/nanomedicine-nanotechnology-biology-and-medicine/editorial-board&quot;&gt;Nanomedicine : Nanotechnology, Biology, and Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, where Webster is an Associate Editor. See e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/582FCA40E662923EAC611828E80CBE&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The apparent duplications in the colorful image on the right below this text were &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C&quot;&gt;explained by the first author on PubPeer &lt;/a&gt;as  “&lt;em&gt;the voltage of the instrument is not insufficient in that time, so that the carbon membrane (which was bought homemade) on the copper screen may affect the background and the resolution of the picture, which leads to this fuzzy image, bringing you some identification troubles&lt;/em&gt;” —  sort of blaming me for seeing these duplications. You may remember that I awarded the journal a &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2020/11/15/nanomedicine-nanotechnology-biology-and-medicine-wins-third-this-image-is-fine-award/&quot;&gt;This Image Is Fine Award&lt;/a&gt; in November 2020. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The image got replaced with something less obnoxious, without the journal even blinking when the authors wrote &lt;em&gt;“there was an inadvertent mistake for Figure 3, B which appeared as a replicated image”&lt;/em&gt;. In my professional opinion, both images contain duplicated parts — and both papers should have been retracted. But the journal had a severe conflict of interest in both cases. One of the senior authors is an Associate Editor at the journal, so the papers were not handled according to COPE guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-2567&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;2567&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm.png?w=840&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;2664,1250&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.com/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3-15-32-pm/&quot; src=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm.png?w=1024&quot; /&gt;Two examples of papers with severe image concerns, published in a journal where one of the senior author serves on the Editorial Board. In both cases, the authors were allowed to replace these figures with a clean panel, and the paper got a correction. From: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/582FCA40E662923EAC611828E80CBE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://pubpeer.com/publications/582FCA40E662923EAC611828E80CBE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several other papers with image problems were published in Dove’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dovepress.com/journal-editor-international-journal-of-nanomedicine-eic5&quot;&gt;International Journal of Nanomedicine&lt;/a&gt;, where Webster is the founding Editor-in-Chief, and not surprisingly these have not been acted upon. It is always complicated to investigate such cases if one of the authors is the founding father of the journal. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the muddy corrections at the journals, it has to be said that Northeastern University appears to have handled this case appropriately and swiftly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As reported by For Better Science, the Webster lab was suspended in November 2020, and now in May 2021 Webster has left the university. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, only 8 of these 69 papers have been corrected so far (and as we have seen above, that was not always a good decision), while as of today zero papers have been retracted. I hope the university will contact the journals with the findings of their investigation, advising them which of these cases involved research misconduct. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emily Chenette, Editor-in-Chief, PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS empowers researchers to transform science by offering more options for credit, transparency and choice. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/submit-your-lab-and-study-protocols-plos-one/&quot;&gt;launch&lt;/a&gt; of Lab Protocols and Study Protocols in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year supported this crucial goal by bringing reproducibility and transparency to research, and enabling those who contributed to study design to receive credit for their contributions.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re delighted to share the news that two Study Protocols have now been published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249435&quot;&gt;Satoru Joshita and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, describes a protocol for studying the prevalence and etiology of portopulmonary hypertension in a cohort of Japanese people with chronic liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248791&quot;&gt;John Cole and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, provides the protocol for the Copy Number Variation and Stroke (CaNVAS) Risk and Outcome study. This study aims to identify copy-number variations that are associated with a risk of ischemic stroke in diverse populations. &lt;/p&gt;


      &lt;div class=&quot; block-image-text block-image-text--left&quot; id=&quot;block-image-text--block_6092e00c8ebdc&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__image  block-image-text__image--25&quot;&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;379&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/cole-john-head.jpg&quot; width=&quot;263&quot; /&gt;
                      &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__text&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Cole writes, “Very little is known about the genetics of stroke outcome. In CaNVAS, copy number variation (CNV) variation as associated with both stroke-risk and-outcome will be explored on a large scale basis. Providing the scientific community with the CaNVAS protocol early in the study will help identify other researchers interested in these efforts, with the goal to increase collaboration and scientific discovery regarding CNV throughout the project.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    


&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, by having their Study Protocols reviewed and published, these authors have had the opportunity to ensure that their study designs are robust and reproducible before the research is completed. They’re also contributing to reducing publication bias by sharing the study aims before the results are available. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in submitting your own Study Protocol for consideration, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-study-protocols&quot;&gt;Submission Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; have more information about the submission and review process. One author-friendly feature of Study Protocols is that they are eligible for expedited review if the study has received funding after peer review from an external funding source. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also encourage researchers to share their detailed, verified research methodology by publishing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-lab-protocols&quot;&gt;Lab Protocol&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;. This unique article type was developed in partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://protocols.io&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt;, and consists of two interlinked components: 1) a step-by-step protocol on protocols.io, with access to specialized tools for communicating methodological details and facilitating use of the protocol; and 2) a peer-reviewed &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; article contextualizing the protocol, with sections discussing applications, limitations and expected results. Several Lab Protocols are under review right now, and we look forward to publishing the first article soon! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thank you to our authors, reviewers, editors and readers for contributing to these article types and supporting Open Science at &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;To image neurons in vivo with a large field of view, a large objective is necessary. This big piece of metal and glass is in indirect contact with the brain surface, with only water and maybe a cover slip in between. The objective touching the brain effectively results in local cooling of the brain surface through heat conduction (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/47324&quot;&gt;Roche et al., eLife, 2019&lt;/a&gt;; see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.00557.2012&quot;&gt;Kalmbach and Waters, J Neurophysiology, 2012&lt;/a&gt;). Is this a problem?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is: Cooling by only few degrees can result in a drop of capillary blood flow and some side-effects (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/47324&quot;&gt;Roche et al., eLife, 2019&lt;/a&gt;). And it has also been shown (in slice work) that minor temperatures changes can affect the activity of astrocytic microdomains (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006349520308493&quot;&gt;Schmidt and Oheim, Biophysical J, 2020&lt;/a&gt;), which might in turn affect neuronal plasticity or even neuronal activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a specific experiment, I wanted to briefly test how such a temperature drop affects my results. Roche et al. used a commercial &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oko-lab.com/live-cell-imaging/objective-heater&quot;&gt;objective heating device&lt;/a&gt; with temperature controller, and a brief email exchange with senior author &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurotree.org/beta/peopleinfo.php?pid=9038&quot;&gt;Serge Charpak&lt;/a&gt; was quite helpful to get started. However, the tools used by Roche et al. are relatively expensive. In addition, they used a fancy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omega.co.uk/pptst/5TC.html&quot;&gt;thermocouple&lt;/a&gt; element together with a specialized amplifier from National Instruments to probe the temperature below the objective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since this was only a brief test experiment, I was hesitant to buy expensive equipment that would maybe never be used again. As a first attempt, I wrapped a heating pad, which is normally used to keep the temperature of mice during anesthesia at physiological levels, around the objective; however, the immersion medium below the objective could only heated up to something like 28°C, which is quite a bit below the desired 37°C.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6792&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6792&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;heating_pad&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1000,606&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/heating_pad-2/&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg?w=1000&quot; /&gt;Heating pad, wrapped around a 16x water immersion objective. Not hot enough.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I got in touch with Martin Wieckhorst, a very skilled technician from my institute. He suggested a more effective heating of the objective by using a very simple solution. After a layer of insulation tape (Kapton tape, see picture below), we wrapped a constantan wire, which he had available from another project, in spirals around the objective body, followed again by a layer of insulation tape. Then, using a lab power supply, we just sent some current (ca. 1A at 10 V) through the wire. The wire acts as a resistor – therefore it is important that adjacent spirals do not touch each other – and produces simply heat that is taken up by the objective body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6794&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6794&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;constantan&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1000,641&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/constantan/&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg?w=1000&quot; /&gt;Constantan wire wrapped in spirals around the objective body. Semi-transparent Kapton tape used for insulation makes the wires barely visible on this picture.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To measure the temperature below the objective, we needed a sensor as small as possible. A typical thermometer head would simply not fit into the space between objective and brain surface. We decided to use a thermistor or RTD (resistance temperature detectors). How can we read out the resistance and convert it into temperature? Fortunately, Martin found an old heating block which contained a temperature controller (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.watlow.com/-/media/documents/user-manuals/series-965-eng-c.ashx&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;). These controllers are typically capable to use information from standardized  thermistors of different kinds or thermocouples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we bought the sensor itself, a PT100 thermistor (I think it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn-reichelt.de/documents/datenblatt/B400/M310_EN.pdf&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) with a very small spatial footprint. The connection from the PT100 to the temperature controller is pretty straightforward once you understand the connection scheme based on three wires (&lt;a href=&quot;https://control.com/textbook/continuous-temperature-measurement/thermistors-and-resistance-temperature-detectors-rtds/&quot;&gt;explained here&lt;/a&gt;). This three-wire scheme serves to eliminate the effect of the electrical resistance of the cables on the measurement. Then, we dipped the head of the PT100 into non-corrosive hot glue in order to prevent a shortcut of the PT100 resistor once it dips into the immersion medium. The immersion medium is at least partially conductive and would therefore affect the measure resistance and also the measured temperature. Once we had everything set up, we checked the functionality of the sensor in a water bath, using a standard thermometer for calibration. Another way to perform this calibration would be an ice bath, which is stably at 0°C. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6796&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6796&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;thermosensor&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1000,666&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/thermosensor/&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg?w=1000&quot; /&gt;A repurposed heating block to read out a thermistor. We first looked up the data sheet of the built-in controller (bottom right) and then connected a PT100 thermosensor to its inputs. The PT100 sensor is located at the tiny end of the blue cable (inset), covered by a thin film of non-corrosive hot glue.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The contact surface of my objective with the immersion medium is mostly glass and a bit of plastic, therefore it took roughly 30-60 min until the temperature below the objective reached a stable value of around 37°C. In order to prevent that the heat is distributed throughout the whole microscope, we used a plastic objective holder that does not conduct heat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, I found this small project very instructive. First, I was surprised to learn how reliable and fast an objective heater based on simple resistive wire can be. Heating up the metal part of the objective up to &amp;gt;60°C within minutes was no problem. It took however much longer until the non-metal parts of the objective also reached the desired temperature. I was also glad to see that the objective (16x Nikon) was not damaged and its resolution during imaging was not affected by its increased temperature! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem of designing a very small temperature sensor was more complicated, also due to the standard three-wire scheme to measure with thermistors. However, all components that we used were relatively cheap, and I think that these temperature measurement devices are interesting tools that could be used also for other experiments, e.g., to monitor body temperature or to build custom-made temperature controllers of water bath temperature for slice experiments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 Roll out of first open access books fully funded by Opening the Future

We're thrilled to announce that our Opening the Future library membership programme has reached the threshold needed to begin funding the first titles in open access.

The Opening the Future platform is a CEU Press and COPIM initiative, launched earlier this year to facilitate transitioning the entire monograph program of CEU Press into open access together with its partners Project MUSE, LYRASIS and Jisc. Within the model, which is a first of its kind, CEU Press provides access to portions of their highly-regarded backlist, to which members subscribe. The revenue from these subscriptions is allocated entirely to allow the frontlist to be OA from the date of publication.

Words in Space and Time: Historical Atlas of Language Politics in Modern Central Europe by Dr Tomasz Kamusella will be the first title to be published OA through the programme. The atlas, available this autumn, offers novel insights into the history and mechanics of Central Europe’s languages as products of human history and a part of culture. It includes forty-two annotated and interactive maps.

Further titles will be announced soon and advance notice will be given to avoid any doubledipping.

Opening the Future is a simple and cost-effective way for libraries to support OA books for HSS subjects especially. With 250 libraries, each participating at appropriate pricing tiers in the model, CEU Press can publish 25 OA books at a cost of 11 EUR / 13 USD / 10 GBP per monograph for each library (if we reach our targets).

“With the Opening the Future model, CEU Press and COPIM developed a fair pricing system in the true sense of the word “fair” that allows libraries of all sizes and budgets to support OA monograph publishing in a sustainable way,” said Curtis Brundy, Associate University Librarian for Scholarly Communication and Collections at Iowa State University, a member of the OtF programme.

“During the past five years, the move toward open access for all publicly-funded research publications has become a new norm and goal. CEU Press with its own OtF project trailblazes this new ground as a leader in this regard,” said Dr Tomasz Kamusella, Reader at the University of St. Andrews, UK.

More Information

For libraries or other institutions that want to support the move to immediate OA, without author-facing charges, more information can be found at https://ceup.openingthefuture.net/. For further details on the pricing and structure of the model, see the FAQs and resources web pages.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Author: Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, PLOS’ Director of Open Research Solutions&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Early career researchers again appear to be at the vanguard of open research, with them reporting more positive attitudes towards sharing of code compared to more experienced researchers – as found in PLOS research released as a&lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/f73a6/&quot;&gt; preprint this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the end of March 2021 &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008867&quot;&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; a more stringent policy on sharing code associated with articles published in the journal. This was in response to a desire of members of the journal’s community to go further to promote open science, which appears to be reflected in the community at large – determined through collaborative research between PLOS and the journal’s community of editors and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008725&quot;&gt;more than 40%&lt;/a&gt; of papers published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology &lt;/em&gt;voluntarily shared their code already, &lt;em&gt;requiring&lt;/em&gt; more authors to share more of their research outputs as a condition of publication is not a decision to be taken lightly by any journal. Therefore, to better understand the attitudes and experiences of the computational biology community in relation to code sharing, we designed a survey to help us understand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is a mandatory code sharing policy suitable for researchers in the community?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What proportion of researchers’ papers generate code?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What concerns do they have about code sharing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How common are these concerns?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How much would submissions to the journal be affected?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are there differences in different segments of researchers (regions, disciplines, career stages)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Supporting the editorial announcing the policy and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13366025&quot;&gt;survey dataset&lt;/a&gt; that were released in March, a more in-depth analysis of our survey of more than 200 researchers has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/f73a6/&quot;&gt;released as a preprin&lt;/a&gt;t. As well as supporting the journal’s plans, we hope this work will be a resource for other stakeholders considering adoption of new policies on sharing of code. Along with research data and protocols, sharing of code is important to help ensure research is reusable and reproducible but, as we discovered when developing the policy, there is limited evidence on the prevalence of code sharing – relative to other open research practices such as data sharing – and researchers’ experiences with sharing code and software.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors surveyed report that, on average, 71% of their research articles have associated code, and that for the average author, code has not been shared for 32% of these papers. A lot of researchers had not shared their code in the past due to practical or technical issues such as insufficient time, skills or systems dependencies, which — at least in principle — would not prevent compliance with a mandatory code sharing policy. Twenty two percent of respondents who had not shared their code in the past, however, cited intellectual property (IP) concerns — a legitimate issue that might prevent public sharing of code under a mandatory policy. In combination with these survey results and testing draft versions of the policy with researchers in the field, we concluded that an inclusive policy would need to permit exemptions in certain cases. However, the results also implied that more of the respondents’ previous publications could have shared code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Reasons given by respondents for not sharing code publicly in the past.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-18885&quot; height=&quot;433&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Figure-1.png&quot; width=&quot;1006&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another key finding was differences in levels of acceptance of a mandatory code sharing policy between research fields, and career stage (as determined by the number of previous publications respondents had published). Medical researchers reported being less likely to submit to the journal if it had a mandatory code sharing policy, as did researchers with more than 100 publications. Whereas, researchers with fewer than 20 published papers showed more positive responses towards submitting to the journal if it implemented a code sharing policy. Other studies have found greater affinity for open research amongst early career researchers, including a 2021 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JxnxXjJJ58?amp=1&quot;&gt;peer-reviewed survey of Early Career Researchers (ECRs) within the Max Planck society&lt;/a&gt;, which concluded ECRs seem to hold a generally positive view toward open research practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Respondents were asked “If PLOS Computational Biology required you to publicly share any computer code you created to interpret your results, how would this affect your likelihood to submit to the journal?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-18886&quot; height=&quot;249&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Figure-2.png&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/how-can-we-increase-adoption-of-open-research-practices/&quot;&gt;what we discovered about researchers’ needs and priorities for data sharing in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, respondents were satisfied with their ability to share &lt;em&gt;their own&lt;/em&gt; code but were less satisfied with their ability to access other researchers’ code. From this we infer that offering researchers new products or services to share code, at least in this community, in the absence of a stronger policy, would be unlikely to achieve the goal: of measurably increasing the availability of code with the journal’s publications. However, as with research data, we see opportunities for journals and publishers to increase findability and accessibility – and ultimately reuse – of code generated by researchers, which in turn can help realise more benefits of open research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the preprint &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/f73a6/&quot;&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;and survey dataset &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13366025&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Please note our results have not yet been peer reviewed, but will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
