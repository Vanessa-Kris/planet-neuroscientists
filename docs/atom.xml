&lt;p&gt;It feels selfish to fret – it’s the other person who is suffering – but agonising over what to say to a friend in need can be incredibly anxiety provoking. If you want to be supportive (and not make matters worse), what are the right words to say to someone who has experienced a relationship break-up, for instance, or lost their job? Should you express sympathy, downplay the situation, say you know how they feel, or something else entirely? A series of studies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01973533.2018.1509341&quot;&gt;in &lt;em&gt;Basic and Applied Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will offer relief to anyone who has ever agonised over this predicament – the findings suggest that in fact there are few, if any, “magic statements that, if spoken, would provide lasting comfort to the recipient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shawna Tanner at Wayne State University and her colleagues propose that in all likelihood trying too hard to say the right thing could actually lead you to make “clumsy statements that do more harm than good”. They advise that as long as your friend or relative sees you as supportive, then your “mere presence and sympathy is likely enough”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35430&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanner’s team first re-analysed data published in 2008 that involved nearly 300 schoolchildren (aged 10 to 15) rating the supportiveness of six statements. These were ostensibly made by one friend to another, who had either had an academic set-back or been rejected from a group picnic. The six statements represented different supportive strategies such as offering sympathy, being optimistic or minimising the seriousness of the situation. There was barely any agreement between the children in their ratings of the supportiveness of the statements. A more important factor was the children’s own tendencies – some of them, more than others, were inclined to see the statements as generally more supportive. Comfort, then, is in the ears of the listener, not the words themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study backed this up. The researchers asked 54 undergrads to rate the supportiveness of 96 statements across eight hypothetical situations, deliberately composed to appeal to people with certain personality traits – for example, there were positive-thinking type statements designed to appeal to optimists (e.g. “things have a funny way of working out for the best”) and community-minded statements designed to appeal to people with a sociable, collegiate disposition (e.g. “Well, your friends like you better anyway and now you can spend more time with us”). Once again, there was very little agreement between the students in which statements were considered the more supportive, and this was the case even when restricting the analysis to sub-groups of the students with similar personality traits. Instead, more relevant were participants’ own idiosyncrasies – how they happened to like some supportive statements but not others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in an effort to increase the realism of their investigation, the researchers asked 33 clinical psychologists, undergrad and graduate clinical trainees to rate the supportiveness of statements made by therapists in therapy training videos. Once more there was little agreement about which statements were the more supportive, even among the sub-groups (for instance, among the qualified clinical psychologists specifically).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background to these new findings is that past research has shown there is also little agreement between people about the trait supportiveness, or not, of other individuals. Tanner’s team reasoned that this subjectivity need not necessarily apply to supportive utterances, but it seems it does. There is not something about certain people, nor certain carefully chosen words, that makes them universally comforting. Rather – and likely for highly complex reasons – we each have an idiosyncratic take on who is supportive and which words we find most helpful. While further research is needed to confirm this take – including studies in more realistic situations and involving people from varied cultures – for now this message should bring reassurance to anyone who has worried about saying the right thing to a friend or relative in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01973533.2018.1509341&quot;&gt;What is the Right Thing to Say? Agreement among Perceivers on the Supportiveness of Statements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/news/fau-and-max-planck-florida-institute-partner-to-launch-the-only-program-of-its-kind-in-the-world-for-high-school-students/"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The brightest STEM high school students can now work side-by-side with preeminent scientists at one of the world’s leading neuroscience research institutions. The Florida Atlantic University Max Planck Academy on the John D. MacArthur Campus in Jupiter stands to redefine approaches to STEM (science-technology-engineering and math) education, not just in South Florida, but nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Based on historical educational reform efforts, the FAU Max Planck Academy will be the most consequential shift in the delivery of education in the United States in decades,” said Joel Herbst, Ed.D., superintendent of FAU PK-12 schools and educational programs. “This is a significant pivot from the traditional model of delivering education. We are offering exceptional high school students an extraordinary opportunity to work alongside renowned scientists. As the only program of its kind in the world, the Academy will serve as the new model for STEM education delivery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FAU Max Planck Academy is the latest partnership between FAU, the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) and the Germany-based Max Planck Society, expanding on similar opportunities for FAU’s &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/BratiDas-IBAN.php&quot;&gt;graduate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/fau-max-planck-society-undergraduate-honors-program.php&quot;&gt;undergraduate students&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. This unprecedented program will open the laboratories of Max Planck to high school students, allowing them to participate in world-class research and scientific discoveries as part of their curriculum.  Six high-achieving FAU High students currently are dual-enrolled in an Academy pilot program, directly learning from scientists – including Nobel Laureates – and spending time in MPFI labs.  The students were selected based on the following criteria: National Merit Scholars, strong academic achievement as measured by a high grade point average and an expressed interest in data science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Academy will be organized as a standalone extension of FAU High School – a nationally recognized, public “Blue Ribbon School” located on FAU’s Boca Raton campus that offers an accelerated pre-collegiate program where students work toward a cost-free bachelor’s degree and high school diploma simultaneously. The Academy in Jupiter will offer a unique and individualized program for students, starting in their junior year of high school. Enriched, honors academic pathways in STEM will be pursued, including neuroscience, biological sciences, chemistry, engineering and computer science. These students will ultimately gain priority admission into the undergraduate Max Planck Honors program which was launched last spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAU Max Planck Academy students will assist MPFI researchers in a number of ways, such as engaging in laboratory research, organizing and analyzing big data using machine learning and other advanced computational techniques, or assisting in MPFI’s state-of-the-art Scientific Core facilities, such as electron microscopy, molecular biology, and the Imaging Center. Benefiting from the international presence of MPFI and the Max Planck Society, the Academy experience will lead to extraordinary international networking, mentorship, and study abroad opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Max Planck Society has a long history of investing in the education of the next generation of scientists. Our ideal has always to been to provide the most promising minds with state-of-the-art resources and opportunities. We have proudly educated thousands of junior scientists at the college, Ph.D. and postdoctoral level, and are now excited to extend the Max Planck model of scientific excellence to the high-school level,” said David Fitzpatrick, Ph.D., CEO and scientific director of MPFI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, FAU President John Kelly explored expanding the FAU High program to offer targeted educational tracks for specific disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We explored how we could scale and replicate FAU High, as well as build specific pipelines to various disciplines for our best students,” said Kelly. “Just a few years later, FAU High has gone from 78 students to 570. We’ve since launched the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/fau-launches-first-md-pipeline-program.php&quot;&gt;M.D. Direct pipeline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, securing seats in our Schmidt College of Medicine for high school students interested in becoming physicians, and now we’re launching the FAU Max Planck Academy for the brightest STEM students. This new program could not have happened without the hard work of our superintendent Joel Herbst and his team, and a shared vision with the leadership at Max Planck.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 35-50 students will be admitted in the inaugural class, eventually scaling up to about 50 students. Beginning in 2019, the highly selective application process will target National Merit semifinalists, as well as the best STEM students from around the world. The first class is slated to begin in fall 2020 and to graduate in spring 2022. Students who successfully complete this exceptional program will earn a high school diploma embossed with both the FAU and Max Planck seals, and at least two years of accelerated college credit – tuition free – leading to elite research experiences and distinction through the FAU Max Planck Honors program and accelerated bachelor’s degree at FAU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This new STEM education model can be replicated with other elite research organizations to help them find new talent, which is needed as many studies point to a looming shortfall in STEM degrees verses STEM workforce needs,” said Herbst. “We believe the best evidence-based strategy to help combat the STEM employment gap is the early college, high school approach.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new survey of beliefs held by social psychologists (335 mostly US-based members of the Society of Experimental Social Psychology) has confirmed previous reports that the field is overwhelmingly populated by researchers of a left-wing, liberal bent. What’s more, David Buss and William von Hippel – the evolutionary psychologists who conducted and analysed the survey – say their findings, &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-57934-001&quot;&gt;published open-access in &lt;em&gt;Archives of Scientific Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggest that many of these social psychologists are opposed, for ideological reasons, to insights rooted in evolutionary psychology and that this is impeding them from developing a “proper science of social psychology”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buss and von Hippel add that compounding matters is an irony – the social psychologists’ desire to signal their ideological stance and commitment to others who share their political views, which is a manifestation of the evolved human adaptation to form coalitions. “Part of this virtue signalling entails rejecting a caricature of evolutionary psychology that no scientist actually holds,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35417&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the political bias among social psychologists, Buss and von Hippel found that 95 per cent were mostly liberal and left-wing in their views (also, among the US respondents, only 4 had voted Republican in the prior Presidential election while 305 had voted Democrat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quizzing the social psychologists on their views of evolutionary theory, Buss and von Hippel found that they overwhelmingly accepted the principles of Darwinian evolution and also that it applied to humans, but when it came to whether evolutionary theory applies to human psychology and behaviour, the sample was split, with many social psychologists rejecting this notion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging deeper into the survey results, there was no evidence that the social psychologists were averse to evolutionary psychology for religious reasons, but many did reject the idea that humans might be inherently violent (in certain situations) or that some people are widely considered more physically attractive than others due to universal evolved standards of attractiveness – perhaps, Buss and von Hippel suggested, this is because “they dislike the implications regarding &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/12/what-are-we-like-10-psychology-findings-that-reveal-the-worst-of-human-nature/&quot;&gt;the dark side of human nature&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Buss and von Hippel asked the social psychologists about their views on the truth of five hot button statements related to the biological basis of average sex differences, such as whether such differences are primarily genetic rather than environmental, whether sex-differentiated hormones play a role, and whether it might be more difficult for men than women to stay faithful in long-term romantic relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answers to three of these five hot-button questions accounted for a small but statistically significant amount of the variance in the social psychologists’ position on whether evolutionary theory applies to human psychology and their self-reported political ideology. This pattern is consistent with the idea that, while the relation between political ideology and scientific beliefs is complex, some social psychologists are inclined to reject evolutionary psychology findings on ideological grounds (in keeping with this interpretation, a substantial portion of the sample said it would be bad if the hot-button findings were widely reported).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a case in point, Buss and von Hippel highlight the recent book &lt;em&gt;Testosterone Rex:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Unmaking the Myths of Our Gendered Minds&lt;/em&gt; by psychologist Cordelia Fine – a text that argues against biological differences between the sexes (and in favour of sociological explanations) and which won wide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/18/testosterone-rex-review-cordelia-fine&quot;&gt;praise from journalists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsociety.org/news/2017/09/cordelia-fine-wins-30th-anniversary-royal-society-insight-investment-science-book-prize/&quot;&gt;left-leaning scientists&lt;/a&gt; around the globe, while at the same time receiving scathing criticism from &lt;a href=&quot;https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2017/09/28/a-new-critique-of-cordelia-fines-testosterone-rex/&quot;&gt;evolutionary biologists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://quillette.com/2017/03/21/cordelia-fines-testosterone-rex-a-review/&quot;&gt;psychologists&lt;/a&gt; with relevant expertise in evolutionary science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buss and von Hippel argue that Fine and others are motivated by social justice goals (in this case gender equality) to reject findings from evolutionary biology and psychology – or a caricature of them. But they believe this is a mistake, not only for the obvious reason that it is wrong to misrepresent the evidence, but also because important moral principles – such as equality – should not be founded on the the idea that there are no biological differences between women and men. Here they quote the author and evolutionary psychologist Steven Pinker, who argued, “… equality is not the empirical claim that all groups of humans are interchangeable; it is the moral principle that individuals should not be judged or constrained by the average properties of their group.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buss and von Hippel think that, motivated by principles of social justice, many social psychologists are ideologically opposed to what they mistakenly think evolutionary psychology argues for – namely genetic determinism, environmental irrelevance, and the idea that attempts to change human behaviour are doomed to fail. In fact, these are erroneous caricatures and evolutionary psychology does not espouse any of these beliefs. It does though recognise that we are not blank slates and that our minds and behaviour have been shaped by evolution in important ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critically, Buss and von Hippel make the point that recognising our evolved psychological adaptations and predilections will actually lead to more effective efforts toward social justice (on the other hand, denying the biological roots of human nature will surely blind researchers from understanding some of the important factors at play in the social injustices that they seek to address). The pair add that, ironically, it is the evolved human tendency to form coalitions that leads “…social scientists to signal ideological commitments to their presumptive coalitions rather than to ferret out the most compelling scientific theories and empirical findings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On an optimistic note, Buss and von Hippel point out that their survey found that a substantial minority of social psychologists &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; endorse findings rooted in evolutionary biology. But still there is a long way to go until the schism in psychological and theoretical perspectives is bridged – a situation they believe is likely made worse by the lack of proper training in evolutionary sciences in psychology. “Not a single degree-granting institution in the United States, to our knowledge, requires even a single course in evolutionary biology as part of a degree in psychology,” they write, adding that this is “an astonishing educational gap that disconnects psychology from the rest of the life sciences.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h4&gt;When cortex is useless, what do we learn?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/938/1*DbFF6adUhl5a8u_yOaec5g.png&quot; /&gt;Chameleon Designs / Noun Project&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cortex, that many layered cake of neurons, occupies a special place in neuroscience. Our best guess at the root of our prodigious intellectual abilities — of language, of sculpture, of base-jumping in a kilt — is that our cortex is far more dense with neurons than any other species. Our dominant sense, sight, commands a third or more of the entire cortex. And its exquisite circuitry hints at devilishly complex computations, of probabilities, of inference, of algorithms that AIs can only dream of. If we want to understand the brain from a human perspective, the cortex is where we must start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The fact that it is also by far the easiest part of the brain to record from in both animals and humans, as it’s right at the top, is &lt;strong&gt;entirely coincidental&lt;/strong&gt;, and shall not detain us further here.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it’s a right bugger when it turns out cortex is essentially useless. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0527-y&quot;&gt;Writing in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Kate Hong and colleagues in Randy Bruno’s lab have reported just that: a mouse can happily use a single whisker to solve a problem even when the special bit of cortex representing that specific whisker is missing. Worse, the mouse can even learn to solve the problem from scratch, without apparently noticing it has a hole in its cortex where lots of important stuff should be happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is cortex then just a blanket to keep the rest of the brain warm? (Peter Redgrave, on innumerable occasions). No, but damn we have to be careful about what we claim cortex is necessary for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong and friends set out to answer a different question: what is the difference between temporarily and permanently turning off a bit of cortex? If you want to do such complex monkeying around with a bit of cortex, then you need a simple behaviour to study, and you need to be able to turn off a bit of cortex that should be involved in that behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you may know that mice have whiskers. The nice thing about whiskers is that each big whisker has a set of dedicated neurons in cortex, which tend to be active only when that big whisker is tweaked, dabbed, or smacks into something. And it is (relatively) easy to find those neurons, because you can tweak the whisker and find which bit of cortex lights up. The bit of cortex representing one big whisker is then a juicy target for turning it off to see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Hong and friends set their mice the task of detecting a pole with one big whisker. On each trial, the mouse held down a lever to say it was ready to take the test. Then either the pole swung within range of their big whisker, or it swung the other way, out of reach. When the pole was in range, it meant reward was available. If the pole was out range it meant there was no reward available right now, and the mouse had to keep holding down the lever until the pole reset — then it could let go and, in its own time, start again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mouse’s test was thus to swish its whisker and see if it hit the pole. A hit should mean to the mouse “aha! I can go and get a reward”; a miss should mean “aha! There is no reward; I’ll wait right here and keep pressing down this lever for some arbitrary reason known only to those dorks over there in white coats”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice had to learn all this by trial and error — pressing a lever, swishing the whisker, hitting a pole (or not), and letting go of the lever (or not). They learn this quickly. Quicker than some of us, I’d wager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the mice had learnt, Hong and friends permanently turned off the big whisker’s cortical neurons by removing them. And lo, performance immediately went to pot. The mice made the wrong decisions about whether the pole was hit or not, and got far fewer rewards as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing unexpected there. Monkey around in cortex and it makes a mess of performance, big whoop. But now the kicker: the terrible performance was on the first day after removing the neurons. On the second day after removal, the mice recovered completely. They performed just as well as they’d done before anyone monkeyed around with their cortex. And carried on doing so for all the following days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which led Hong and colleagues to the crucial question: er, if mice can apparently re-learn the task in a matter of a day, did they need this bit of cortex to learn in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, they didn’t. Removing the big whisker’s neurons from cortex before any training had no effect on learning at all. Mice learnt equally fast and equally well with or without that bit of cortex. Sheesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result of this study may seem simple, but it has many ramifications. There are lessons here for any serious student of how brains work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesson one is that establishing causality is a pain. You’d think that turning off a part of the brain and seeing that a behaviour breaks would be big kahuna levels of evidence that the brain part in question causes that behaviour. But no. Here Hong and co have shown us, again, that turning off some brain bit does not establish causality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reinforce how misleading this turning off can be, in a separate set of experiments Hong used the terrific toolbox of modern neuroscience to temporarily turn off the cortical neurons representing that big whisker, but only on some, randomly chosen, trials (AKA they expressed a light-sensitive opsin in the pyramidal cells of barrel C2, which suppressed spiking in those neurons when activated with a light). And performance went to pot on just the trials when the neurons were turned off, remaining just fine on the rest of the trials. Read uncritically, this would imply that the big whisker neurons were essential for doing the task — after all, whenever you turn them off, performance tanks. But we know this is not true: the same bit of cortex could be turned off completely, and yet the mice still could do the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesson two is that establishing causality is a &lt;strong&gt;pain&lt;/strong&gt;. Even when the big whisker’s neurons were turned off or removed, the dip in performance was not back to random guessing. The mice still did better than chance, so something else in the brain was still able to cope with the task a bit. Indeed when Hong and co temporarily removed the big whisker itself, then the performance of the mice collapsed completely, and they did no better than guessing randomly where the pole was. Which, of course, is what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesson three is that establishing causality is a PAIN. Notice that removing the big whisker neurons immediately impaired the mice who had already learnt the task. But removing the big whisker neurons before learning did not have any effect on learning itself. Just because a brain region seems to be involved in performing a task does not mean it is critical to learn that task. And vice versa: a brain region may be necessary to learn it, but not do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesson four is that ESTABLISHING CAUSALITY IS A PAIN. As previously noted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16442&quot;&gt;by Otchy and co&lt;/a&gt;, when performance tanks because you’ve shut down a bit of brain, but recovers quickly, then it actually establishes the opposite of what you wanted to do. It means that turning of that bit of cortex interfered with the normal function of a different bit of the brain — the bit that could do the task perfectly well without cortex. So all you’ve shown is that the bit of cortex you turned off is annoying a different part of the brain. And when you shut off the normal signals from that bit of cortex, it throws another bit of brain out of whack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our final lesson is the deepest: degeneracy. Or, the brain has multiple solutions to the same problem. Signals from the whisker go to many places in the brain, not just cortex. They go to various bits of thalamus and brainstem, that then send the signals on to other complex bits of brain that aren’t cortex (like striatum or the superior colliculus). Hong and co’s data tells us that a task as simple as “is the pole there or not” doesn’t need the big whisker signals to be routed to the big whisker parts of cortex — there are other bits of brain that are equally capable of solving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems we’ve learnt a simple rule about the mouse brain: if cortex is there, use that; if not, something else can cope. The question is, how complex does a task have to be before only cortex can cope? The answer is almost certainly Jean-Pipsqueak Sartre’s hell: dealing with other mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want more?

&lt;p&gt;For people diagnosed with what’s known as “treatment-resistant major depressive disorder” the prognosis is not good – the low mood and emotional pain for these individuals has not lifted even though they are on a combination of antidepressant medications and may also have participated in psychotherapy. However a glimmer of hope comes via a research group in Portugal who reported recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002239561830164X#mmc1&quot;&gt;in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychiatric Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that adopting a pet “enhanced” the effects of anti-depressant medication for a significant minority of their participants with previously treatment-resistant depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35366&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Thirty-three of them agreed to do so (20 adopted a dog or dogs, 7 a cat); another 33 who declined were allocated to form a control group. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text surname&quot;&gt;All the participants were assessed for their depression symptoms and general functioning at baseline and then again at 4, 8 and 12-week follow-up. Thirty individuals in each group successfully attended all the required assessments. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main finding is that by the end of the study (at the 12-week assessment), just over a third of the pet-adoption group had remitted – that is, their scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale had reduced to the point that their problems were now considered only mild. By contrast, none of the control group had entered remission or in fact showed any signs of change in their symptoms at all. These improvements in the pet group actually began manifesting by week 4 follow-up, suggesting the apparent benefits of pet ownership were rapid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pereira and Fonte said that looking after a pet involves “a strong affinity and companionship that strongly contributes to mental health” and that their results show that people with treatment-resistant depression “that are willing to have a pet should be encouraged to do so”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major weakness of the study is that it depended on participants volunteering to adopt a pet (rather than on random allocation to the pet adoption condition) – so, although pet-adopters and the controls were matched for baseline depression symptoms, there may have been other ways that they differed. For instance, perhaps there was something different about the personalities or social circumstances of the pet adopters that contributed to their willingness to adopt a pet and to their higher remission rates (raising the possibility that the pet adoption itself was not the main “active ingredient” in their recovery). Future, better controlled research may be able to tease apart these possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Pereira and Fonte speculate that the therapeutic benefits of adopting a pet may arise from the responsibilities involved acting to counter the loss of motivation and pleasure associated with depression, and also from the social contact that arises through walking the pet or meeting other pet owners.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In 2012 serial entrepreneur &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Pinter&quot;&gt;Frances Pinter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; founded a new company called Knowledge Unlatched (&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/&quot;&gt;KU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). The goal, she &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/2013/01/an-interview-with-frances-pinter/&quot;&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2013, was to “change the way we fund the publishing of quality content” for book-length publications, and in a way that would allow them to be made open access. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4vy_LNeyZxU/W_pLzl39-QI/AAAAAAAAiDM/_wUrVuaKTjgkvdG_8Uq5LPHF4Po5sQM6gCLcBGAs/s1600/steamer-trunk-3414018_640.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;428&quot; data-original-width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;133&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4vy_LNeyZxU/W_pLzl39-QI/AAAAAAAAiDM/_wUrVuaKTjgkvdG_8Uq5LPHF4Po5sQM6gCLcBGAs/s200/steamer-trunk-3414018_640.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;With that end in mind, Pinter launched a pilot project in which research libraries were invited to pool money to fund the “fixed costs” of publishing monographs. By doing so, Pinter reasoned, PDF and HTML versions of these “unlatched” books could be made freely available on the Web, but print and other premium versions would continue to be sold in the traditional manner. And those libraries that contributed to the pool would earn the right to buy the premium versions at a discounted price. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In a spirit of civic-mindedness Pinter created Knowledge Unlatched as a UK non-profit Community Interest Company (&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company&quot;&gt;CIC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). And with Pinter’s formidable reputation as a publisher, KU quickly acquired mindshare and influence, and went on to play an important role in the thinking about the scope and opportunities for OA monographs, as well as in policy development – both in the UK and globally. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Above all, says Pinter below, KU went on to provide proof of concept for a new way of funding OA monographs, and perhaps of funding OA more generally. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Sustainability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebookseller.com/news/knowledge-unlatched-moves-second-phase-314212&quot;&gt;Initial funding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for KU came from (amongst others) the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bl.uk/aboutus/stratpolprog/trust/&quot;&gt;British Library Trust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/&quot;&gt;Open Society Foundations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Funding_Council_for_England&quot;&gt;HEFCE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, as well as a number of Australian libraries. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;When that funding ended, however, as a non-profit CIC, KU struggled to raise further funds or capital. And with few assets to offer as collateral, commercial loans were equally hard to come by. Consequently, it was not immediately clear how KU could become financially sustainable, or even whether it could. Faced with this truth, says Pinter, she was minded to call it day.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Supporters, however, were urging her to continue and so Pinter drew down a six-figure sum from her pension savings and, with some additional funding from Australia’s Curtin University, she proceeded to a second pilot round. This saw increased support from publishers and a larger number of books offered for unlatching. But while this was encouraging, the sustainability issue had not gone away.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;At this point, Pinter was approached by former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.degruyter.com/&quot;&gt;De Gruyter&lt;/a&gt; CEO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/svenfund/&quot;&gt;Sven Fund&lt;/a&gt; and invited to sell some of KU’s assets. She agreed, and Fund acquired the bulk of KU.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;As a result, KU was transformed from a UK non-profit CIC to a for-profit GmbH based in Berlin, and KU is now owned by another Sven Fund for-profit company called &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fullstopp.com/&quot;&gt;fullstopp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;After acquiring KU, Sven Fund moved quickly to develop and launch a raft of new products and initiatives, including a &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/ku-journals/&quot;&gt;journal collection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://knowledgeunlatched.org/ku-partners/&quot;&gt;KU Partners,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/ku-select-library-info/&quot;&gt;KU Select&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/book-processing-charge-calculator/&quot;&gt;KU Open Funding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The latter is a platform designed to act as a broker between research institutions, publishers, and authors who want to make their monographs OA.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Criticism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;However, KU’s change of status and its more aggressive stance in the marketplace has attracted criticism from the research community. This came to a head last month when former KU employee Marcel Knöchelmann published a &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2018/10/03/knowledge-unlatched-failed-transparency-and-the-commercialisation-of-open-access-book-publishing/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2017/08/15/scholarly-communications-shouldnt-just-be-open-but-non-profit-too/&quot;&gt;LSE Impact Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in which he complained that KU had undergone a process of silent commercialisation. He also suggested that the decision by UK funder &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://re.ukri.org/&quot;&gt;Research England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://re.ukri.org/blog/helen-snaith/open-access-and-monographs/&quot;&gt;contract&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; KU parent fullstopp to undertake a survey of the OA monograph landscape raised conflict of interest issues. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The problem, he said, is that “The parent company of the commercial entity which stands to profit from a future of open access book publishing is advising on what the future of open access book publishing in the UK should be”. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In a separate &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.openbookpublishers.com/why-obp-is-not-participating-in-ku-open-funding-and-why-libraries-should-understand-the-reasons/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; two days later the Director of Open Book Publishers &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/rupert-gatti-113b3620/?originalSubdomain=uk&quot;&gt;Rupert Gatti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; complained that KU was insisting that those publishers who use the KU Open Funding platform must sign an exclusive contract. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;As a result, said Gatti, OBP would not be participating in KU Open Funding. “These types of exclusivity contracts can be used by digital ‘platforms’ as a strategy to monopolise and dominate an industry.”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Other OA monograph publishers have indicated that they too plan to boycott the KU Open Funding platform, including members of the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarled.org/&quot;&gt;ScholarLed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; consortium of academic-led, not-for-profit, open access book publishers.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In response, KU has agreed to cease insisting on exclusive contracts and Research England and fullstopp have said that both the survey questions and (some of ) the responses fullstopp receives to that survey will be made publicly available (more from Research England &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/+RichardPoynder/posts/Ek8Wg2oQiLz&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Nevertheless, it is not clear that critics are yet convinced that KU’s business model is the right one. Nor have they come to terms with its new for-profit status. “I feel crowdfunding from libraries to unlock back- and front-list titles merely funnels more money to conventional academic publishers, who don’t have to change their broken business models at all,”&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/eileen-joy-b6a06a5/&quot;&gt;Eileen Joy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of non-profit &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://punctumbooks.com/&quot;&gt;punctum books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; told me on Twitter. “In other words, it’s not a transformative approach to OA and it keeps broken systems in place.”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;She added, “We don’t want to see too many for-profit ‘middlemen’ between publishers and librarians. We want to build partnerships with libraries (and have already done that; e.g. punctum just inaugurated a two-year pilot partnership with UCSB Library at UC Santa Barbara).”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Eileen Joy concludes: “We are also troubled by the transfer of KU from a non-profit directed by Frances Pinter to a for-profit directed by Sven Fund in Berlin. Does anyone know anything about the details of that transaction / hand-over? Did Sven Fund buy KU from Pinter and for how much? What is her role now? Isn’t Fund a venture capitalist? Does he really have a commitment to the long-term health of a more equitable ecosystem for OA and scholarly communications or is KU a business venture for him?”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, the interview below with Pinter (and what I have said above) will go some way to answering these questions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Logical and inevitable?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We should also note that some view KU’s transformation as both logical and inevitable. “I’m not terribly surprised to see KU shifting to a more – shall we say – corporate model,” says &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-anderson-1475689/&quot;&gt;Rick Anderson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Associate Dean for Collections &amp;amp; Scholarly Communication at the University of Utah’s J. Willard Marriott Library. “I think it had two choices: either continue trying to do something that its marketplace can’t really support (and do it at a loss) or shift to a mode that recognises market realities but upsets the ‘free everything all the time’ ideologues. Unsurprisingly, KU seems to have chosen the sustainable path rather than the politically correct one.”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Anderson adds, “Now, is the sustainable path they’ve chosen the right one? I don’t know. But I will say this: pearl-clutching reactions to the ‘commercialisation’ of OA book publishing are disingenuous at best. If the OA community objected to commercialisation they wouldn’t insist on CC BY.” &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Nevertheless, Anderson too is sceptical about KU’s business model. “I have to confess that the KU plan has never made much sense to me from the very beginning”.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The KU story is an interesting one. More importantly, however, I think it is instructional, since it invites wider questions about open access and the open access movement. For instance, it draws our attention to the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2017/08/15/scholarly-communications-shouldnt-just-be-open-but-non-profit-too/&quot;&gt;growing anxiety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; amongst OA advocates about the role of for-profit companies in scholarly communication. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It is striking, for instance, that an organisation whose founder was just three years ago on the verge of calling it a day is now viewed as a dangerous shark in the OA waters bent on monopolising the monograph business. But perhaps there are good reasons for OA advocates to be anxious: we have learned that in an online world first movers in any new platform market can quickly come to dominate and control that market (and we have a new term for this: “&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Platform-Capitalism-Theory-Redux-Srnicek/dp/1509504877&quot;&gt;platform capitalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;At the same time a view has emerged that says that the real issue here is not whether an organisation is for- or non-profit, but the degree to which it is willing to embrace openness. And many now believe that openness in scholarly communication needs to encompass not just the &lt;i&gt;content&lt;/i&gt; being distributed, but all parts of the &lt;i&gt;infrastructure&lt;/i&gt; that allows that distribution to take place. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Thus, we can see growing calls for “open infrastructures”. This is necessary, the authors of &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/&quot;&gt;this 2015 piece&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; explain, because, “Everything we have gained by opening content and data will be under threat if we allow the enclosure of scholarly infrastructures.” &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Interestingly, one of the authors of that document was &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Neylon&quot;&gt;Cameron Neylon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the new Executive Director of that part of KU that Sven Fund did not acquire – &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kuresearch.org/&quot;&gt;KU Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We could also note that one of those advocating for this greater openness today is&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://about.hindawi.com/team/paul-peters/&quot;&gt; Paul Peters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the CEO of for-profit OA publisher Hindawi. Last year Peters made a case for the necessity of what he refers to as &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://about.hindawi.com/blog/a-radically-open-approach-to-developing-infrastructure-for-open-science/&quot;&gt;four basic principles of openness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in any model where commercial providers develop and maintain open scholarly communications infrastructure. These are: open source, open data, open integrations, and open contracts.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I hope to cover &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;these&lt;/span&gt; wider issues in a future post.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Above all, the KU story is a timely reminder that we live in uncertain times, and we don’t know what the future holds. We certainly don’t know what the fate of the KU business model will be, or how successful the company will prove in its new for-profit status. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Whatever the future holds, Frances Pinter, through her work with KU, has surely helped move our thinking forward. She has also conducted a real-life experiment at a time when experimentation is vital.

To this end KU began inviting research libraries to pool money in order to fund the “fixed costs” of publishing OA&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt; mono&lt;/span&gt;graphs. The idea is that this allows PDF and HTML versions of “unlatched” books to be made freely available on the Web, with premium versions sold in the traditional way. And those libraries who have contributed to the pool are able to buy the premium versions (including, presumably, print copies) of the books at a special discounted price. Is that an accurate description? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FP: &lt;/b&gt;A full explanation of the original concept for the Knowledge Unlatched model can be found in the detailed &lt;a href=&quot;https://culturalscience.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/csci.68/&quot;&gt;report on the pilot project&lt;/a&gt;. The description you give is accurate as far as it goes but misses important details.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Knowledge Unlatched was conceived as a crowdfunding model. In its early stages, it was focused on libraries. This was to ensure that we understood, and were able to respond to, the needs of a clearly defined community. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Initially, libraries indicated a preference for the OA version of titles to be made available as a fully downloadable PDF. ePub is now more widely used and the OA versions of Knowledge Unlatched titles are now often available in ePub format. Print and retail ebooks continue to remain available through the normal commercial channels.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;As Knowledge Unlatched moved beyond the proof of concept and pilot it has been exploring a wider range of constituencies. Supporters of OA through Knowledge Unlatched now include learned societies, and even individuals. An example is &lt;a href=&quot;http://langsci-press.org/&quot;&gt;Language Science Press&lt;/a&gt;, which works with Knowledge Unlatched as its crowdfunding agent.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: The formula appears to have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit; font-size: 12.0pt;&quot;&gt;been&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; successful: I understand KU is now the largest gatekeeper to OA scholarly books. What aspect of KU’s success do you take particular pride in and why?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FP:&lt;/b&gt; The term ‘gatekeeper’ is an odd choice of word. I’ve always thought of KU as a ‘facilitator’ of OA. Knowledge Unlatched facilitates OA for books that have already passed the editorial threshold for a monograph publisher. Knowledge Unlatched should certainly not be the only model for funding OA monographs. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I would suggest that ‘largest’ is also misleading. Knowledge Unlatched has succeeded in crowdfunding OA for a few hundred front-list and a similar number of backlist titles each year. In the context of around 30 thousand monographs published annually in English (an estimate from &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalhistsoc.org/person/richard-fisher/&quot;&gt;Richard Fisher&lt;/a&gt; and others) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oapen.org/search?f1-language=English&quot;&gt;over 4,000 English language monographs in the OAPEN index&lt;/a&gt;, and well over 10,000 listed in DOAB, Knowledge Unlatched is a small part of the overall landscape. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I am most proud of the fact that we changed people’s thinking about possible approaches to funding OA publishing. Regardless of whether or not the core Knowledge Unlatched model ultimately turns out to be one of the better models for supporting OA, Knowledge Unlatched has encouraged people to think about new approaches to supporting the costs of high-quality OA publishing. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Rick Anderson has described &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2015/09/22/proof-of-concept-proof-of-program-and-proof-of-scale-in-scholarly-communication/&quot;&gt;three levels of proof&lt;/a&gt; for ongoing projects or initiatives in scholarly communication – they are proof of concept, proof of program and proof of scalability. I succeeded in providing the scholarly communications community with a proof of concept for a new approach. It is now up to others to adapt and learn from this proof of concept – and to continue driving the OA agenda forward.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: In addition to enabling OA the expectation was that the KU model would lower the costs of monograph publishing. I am wondering how this works. Production costs aside, there is still an intermediary to be paid (KU), which is presumably charging both libraries and publishers for the services it provides. So, there are still intermediary costs to factor in. Have we yet seen prices fall? If so, by how much do you estimate they have fallen? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FP: &lt;/b&gt;We know from &lt;a href=&quot;https://academicbookfuture.org/discoverability-demand-and-access-the-role-of-intermediaries-in-the-uk-supply-chain-for-academic-books-richard-fisher-and-michael-jubb/&quot;&gt;work by Michael Jubb and Richard Fisher&lt;/a&gt; that intermediaries can take as much as 50% of the cost of a book that is paid by libraries. Knowledge Unlatched charges 15% of the BPC [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/openresearch/publishing-with-palgrave-macmillan/publication-charges/&quot;&gt;Book Publication Charge&lt;/a&gt;] equivalent to cover coordination costs. This is used to pay staff and to market the packages to potential contributors.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;An important principle and contributor to the success of the Knowledge Unlatched pilot mode was to not interfere with, or set, input costs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://sr.ithaka.org/publications/the-costs-of-publishing-monographs/&quot;&gt;The Maron Report&lt;/a&gt; shows there are huge variations in ‘getting to first copy’ publishing costs. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In the longer term, it is possible to speculate that both the coordination costs and the input costs could fall. To achieve a reduction of the coordination costs requires substantial scaling up which was not feasible with the capital available to KU as originally constituted. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;An important contribution of the Knowledge Unlatched model is that it makes it possible for publishers to receive an upfront payment. By helping publishers to recoup the costs of publishing a monograph early in its life-cycle the Knowledge Unlatched model reduces the risks associated with publishing. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;For instance, publishers may then choose to produce paperback versions at lower prices as soon as a book is published – where they might otherwise have had to stick to the hardback format in order to recover their input costs before making paperback versions of a title available. I’ve written more on BPC charges &lt;a href=&quot;https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jep/3336451.0021.101?view=text;rgn=main&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;CIC to GmbH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You recently stepped down as CEO of KU in order to do other things. Preparatory to your handing management over to Sven Fund, KU was transitioned from being a UK-based non-profit to a German-based for-profit and is now owned by Fund’s consultancy company &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fullstopp.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;fullstopp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;. I think this happened in 2016. But when did you formally leave KU, and can you talk me through the process by which KU moved from being a non-profit to a for-profit, and how the staff were formally moved from a UK non-profit to a for-profit based in Germany? How does such a transition work? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FP:&lt;/b&gt; I set up Knowledge Unlatched as a membership-based Community Interest Company (CIC) in 2012. This is a UK legal form that is similar to a US B-Corp.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Between 2012 and 2014 direct and in-kind support for the Knowledge Unlatched CIC start-up and proof of concept phases came from a range of sources, including from philanthropic foundations and libraries. Full details of how the first phases of the project were funded are available in the Full Pilot Report &lt;a href=&quot;https://culturalscience.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/csci.68/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The goal of the pilot was always to develop a financially &lt;i&gt;sustainable&lt;/i&gt; model for coordinating the costs of OA for high-quality scholarly monograph publishing. After the proof of concept phase our financial modelling showed that if Knowledge Unlatched was able to achieve a sufficient volume to support core overhead and marketing costs, it could be sustainable. What was required was a capital investment to reach this scale.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;This capital was hard to raise. As a not-for-profit CIC with few assets, we were not able to take on commercial loans. Grant-giving bodies and philanthropic funders regarded the proof of concept as a success – and therefore not requiring further funding from them. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucy-montgomery-8929a41/?originalSubdomain=au&quot;&gt;Lucy Montgomery’s&lt;/a&gt; ability to continue working full time on Knowledge Unlatched had come to an end (she had been funded by a Vice Chancellor’s Research Fellowship from an Australian University, and her fellowship term had concluded). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Like many such efforts seeking funding to expand to sustainability, Knowledge Unlatched was neither fish nor fowl – not seen as an investment opportunity with future returns, nor appropriate for grants. Despite approaching several players with both capital and a potential strategic interest we could not raise the necessary funding. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I was at the point of calling it a day, and in any case was seriously stretched myself as CEO of Manchester University Press. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;However, others urged us to continue beyond proof of concept. I therefore provided the capital personally by loaning the CIC a small six-figure amount of money (obtained from my pension savings) to continue covering costs. That is, I provided a loan to KU CIC to cover the running costs of the second round, which was launched in 2015.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We also secured some additional funding from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.curtin.edu.au/&quot;&gt;Curtin University&lt;/a&gt; in Australia and in the second pilot round we doubled the number of publishers and tripled the number of books. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Then in late 2015 Sven Fund – who had already left de Gruyter and was setting up fullstopp – made an offer for some of the Knowledge Unlatched CIC assets, which we accepted. The agreement with fullstopp was completed at the end of March 2016.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At that point, I handed over Knowledge Unlatched operations to manage the coordination of monograph funding to Sven. I helped out a bit in the next 12 transition months, in order to maximise the chances that Knowledge Unlatched would scale successfully.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;After the sale, in 2016 the GmbH paid for some CIC staff time (including a small amount of my time) for assistance over a transition period of a year. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The only person permanently on the payroll of the CIC was the partnership manager who continued working for Knowledge Unlatched CIC part-time from 2016 through to early 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You say Sven Fund made an offer for some of the Knowledge Unlatched CIC assets and you accepted.

We were guided through the process by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bwbllp.com/&quot;&gt;BWB&lt;/a&gt;, who incidentally also developed the CIC legal form in the UK and were especially well placed to make sure we followed the rules.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: I note you are still listed on the KU web site as a member of the advisory board.

How does that work?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraph&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FP:&lt;/b&gt; As part of the sale of the KU core business it was agreed that in the event that Knowledge Unlatched GmbH made a surplus in the first three years of operation then 50% of that surplus would be paid to Knowledge Unlatched CIC.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;RP: Can you say how much has been paid to KUR by Knowledge Unlatched GmbH under the profit-sharing scheme, and whether there will be any further payments?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FP:&lt;/b&gt; The 50/50 profit share which covers the first three years of the GmbH operations produced no income for the CIC in the first year, £12,000 for the second year and as yet an unknown amount for the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; year, though we expect it to be in the same ballpark.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraph&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;New products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: KU has been very active this year launching a range of new products/initiatives, including KU Select, KU Partners and KU Open Funding. Were you involved in the development of these products?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;FP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;No.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: As I understand it, KU Open Funding is intended to act as a broker between authors, publishers and research institutions so that authors can publish their books open access. How significant a change of direction do you think this is for KU? Do you think it could prove a powerful force in the growth of OA monographs?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FP:&lt;/b&gt; I think Knowledge Unlatched GmbH has identified a need to bring some order to how funding is channelled from sources of funding to publishers. Managing APCs is problematic, and it would be good if the community did not make the same mistakes with BPCs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: One of the criticisms we have seen recently is that KU Open Funding was asking publishers to sign exclusive contracts. The concern is that these exclusive contracts would allow KU to dominate and monopolise the OA monograph market, not least because it will make it difficult for competing platforms to emerge. And as the tool incorporated into KU Open Funding will be tied to the platform there is concern that customers will become locked into a for-profit proprietary platform. Do you see any dangers here, or understand why some are concerned about this development?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FP: &lt;/b&gt;I understand Knowledge Unlatched GmbH has responded to the complaints about exclusivity and these contracts are now not made on an exclusive basis. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I encourage competition and hope this will bring forth lots of new ideas on how the support of high-quality OA monographs can be provided.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;RP: Other OA monograph publishers seem more inclined to develop jointly-owned and managed (and open) alternative platforms. Do you think they can be as successful as a for-profit proprietary platform like Knowledge Unlatched GmbH?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FP: &lt;/b&gt;I am sure there are many successful routes to OA publishing. I believe in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Crossick&quot;&gt;Geoff Crossick’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20180322111256/http:/www.hefce.ac.uk/media/hefce/content/pubs/indirreports/2015/Monographs,and,open,access/2014_monographs.pdf&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that there is no single model that will work for all books.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;RP: Unless I missed it, both the change of ownership and the change of status (nonprofit to for-profit) of KU was not shared with the research community. Indeed, it seems it was only when a former KU employee published a blog post about KU last month that it became widely known, with some who work in the area expressing &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/samoore_/status/1039483048528621569&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;surprise&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; at the news. Do you think that perhaps it was this that led to the recent criticism of KU? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FP:&lt;/b&gt; This is incorrect. A press release was issued and distributed widely. The legal status of the current KU GmbH is stated clearly on every invoice and every formal letter of correspondence as required by German law. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I cannot comment on why people did not note the change, or why it has suddenly, now two and a half years later, become an issue for some people.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Conflict of interest?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Another concern that has been raised by some in the research community is that Research England has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://re.ukri.org/blog/helen-snaith/open-access-and-monographs/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;commissioned fullstopp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; to conduct a quantitative analysis of the current landscape of book publishing in order to provide key evidence to the Universities UK monograph working group. Research England &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/+RichardPoynder/posts/Ek8Wg2oQiLz&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; that fullstopp was open about its relationship with Knowledge Unlatched in its bid submission and that the bid assessors did not perceive there to be a conflict of interest. Nevertheless, it has been put to me that if the Research England report comes back recommending a KU-like model, it will smack of conflict of interest, even though that model may be the most workable/the most sensible. What are your views on this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FP:&lt;/b&gt; I hope it is now clear the ‘Knowledge Unlatched model’ includes a number of initiatives. It would be unfortunate, if not downright silly, if the choice of a contractor for a highly specific piece of quantitative landscape research limited the scope for Research England as a strategic organization to come to an informed conclusion. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Knowledge Unlatched GmbH and/or fullstopp are not producing policy recommendations. Any recommendations made by Research England, Universities UK, Jisc or other bodies are likely to raise some controversy. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;A well-crafted and transparent quantitative study providing high-quality data on the details of publishers of UK monographs will be important in helping to navigate these challenging issues.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: What might seem strange is that last October you co-authored a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/6693/1/Landscape_study_on_OA_and_Monographs_Oct_2017_KE.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;180-page landscape study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; of the OA monograph environment. Does that not suggest that the study aspect of moving to an OA monograph environment is being somewhat over-egged?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;FP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a peculiar question. The studies are quite different, and, in any case, surely more comprehensive information is the basis for making informed policy decisions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The KE Landscape Study examined monograph publishing in eight countries at a high level looking at funding streams and business models. The UKRI RFI called for a detailed quantitative analysis of the diversity and concentration of publishers of UK academic monographs, with a focus on submissions to REF2014, including pricing and other aspects not covered in the Landscape Study. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: One controversial topic with regard to OA monographs is that of licensing, with considerable resistance – especially from historians – to the idea of having to attach CC BY licences to their books. What are your views on licensing?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FP: &lt;/b&gt;My views on licensing have always been that authors should have the right to restrict books to CC BY-ND if that is their preference. If a publisher wants to apply a non-commercial restriction that should be allowed as they are generally in a good position to provide alternative formats which do require some investment – even if nothing like the initial “getting to first copy” costs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: What other important issues do you think the topic of OA monographs raises that have still to be worked out?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;FP: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;I think discovery still needs a lot of work – and it is good to see that this is being recognised. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As we say in the Knowledge Exchange funded Landscape Study &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/6693/1/Landscape_study_on_OA_and_Monographs_Oct_2017_KE.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; there are issues around monograph funding, but these are not as insurmountable as people think.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: What is your view on the likely future of OA monographs, both in Europe and the world generally? Do you think eventually all publicly-funded scholarly monographs will be available on an OA basis, or just a proportion of them?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FP: &lt;/b&gt;I think the majority of monographs will be made OA. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Some of the obstacles that we face today will find solutions. Remember, we are not living in a static world. I support Geoff Crossick’s view taken in 2015 that the ‘direction of travel is clear’. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;There will be road bumps, but if people of good will work together there is a bright future for monographs and the global dissemination of knowledge. That is the prize and we mustn’t lose sight of it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Finally, can you say where you will be putting your efforts going forward? Will you continue to be involved in scholarly publishing for the foreseeable future?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FP: &lt;/b&gt;I’m now a research associate at the London School of Economics. I am working on the history of book-burning, as a rich source of examples of past efforts to de-legitimise knowledge. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I expect to be bowing out of the OA arena entirely in 2019. I wish all of you well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;RP: Ok, good luck with your new endeavours. And thank you for agreeing to do this interview.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FP:&lt;/b&gt; And I would like to thank you for the opportunity to tell your audience the KU and KU Research stories.

how &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/libneurosim&quot;&gt;libneurosim&lt;/a&gt; was to be used with &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/nest&quot;&gt;NEST&lt;/a&gt;. We can now work on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/PyNN&quot;&gt;PyNN&lt;/a&gt; so that
it can at least be used with &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/nest&quot;&gt;NEST&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/brian&quot;&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/nest&quot;&gt;NEST&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/pull/1065&quot;&gt;tweaked to support 32 bit hardware again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/27&quot;&gt;NEURON&lt;/a&gt; has been updated to use a more recent version of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials&quot;&gt;SUNDIALS&lt;/a&gt;. Once this
has been merged into the main codebase, we can proceed with packaging &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/27&quot;&gt;NEURON&lt;/a&gt;
too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've set up a Telegram group for &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; here: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://t.me/NeuroFedora&quot;&gt;https://t.me/NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt;
We'll bridge this to the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#fedora-neuro&quot;&gt;IRC channel&lt;/a&gt; in the near future.
These channels can be used to get in touch with the team for troubleshooting

&lt;p&gt;Writing in the last century, Abraham Maslow (pictured left), one of the founders of Humanistic Psychology, proposed that the path to self-transcendence, and ultimately a greater compassion for all of humanity, requires “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/17/there-are-a-lot-of-myths-and-misconceptions-about-abraham-maslow-and-self-actualisation-a-new-paper-puts-the-record-straight/&quot;&gt;self-actualisation&lt;/a&gt;” – that is, fulfilling your true potential and becoming your authentic self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Scott Barry Kaufman, a psychologist at Barnard College, Columbia University, believes it is time to revive the concept and link it with contemporary psychological theory. “We live in times of increasing divides, selfish concerns, and individualistic pursuits of power,” Kaufman wrote recently in &lt;i&gt;Scientific American &lt;/i&gt;in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/what-does-it-mean-to-be-self-actualized-in-the-21st-century/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; introducing his new research. He hopes that rediscovering the principles of self-actualisation may be just the tonic that the modern world is crying out for. To this end, he’s used modern statistical methods to create a test of self-actualisation, or more specifically, of the 10 characteristics exhibited by self-actualised people, and it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022167818809187&quot;&gt;published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Humanistic Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35345&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaufman first surveyed online participants using the 17 characteristics that Maslow believed were shared by self-actualised people, but he found 7 of these were redundant or irrelevant and did not correlate with others, leaving 10 key characteristics of self-actualisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, he reworded some of Maslow’s original language and labelling to compile a modern 30-item questionnaire featuring 3 items tapping each of these 10 remaining characteristics: Continued freshness of appreciation; Acceptance; Authenticity; Equanimity; Purpose; Efficient perception of reality; Humanitarianism; Peak Experiences; Good moral intuition; and Creative Spirit (see the full questionnaire below and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scottbarrykaufman.com/characteristics-of-self-actualization-scale/&quot;&gt;take the test on Kaufman’s website&lt;/a&gt;; our report on the findings continues underneath).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a survey of over 500 people on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk website, Kaufman found that scores on each of these 10 characteristics tended to correlate, but also that they each made a unique contribution to a unifying factor of self-actualisation – suggesting that this is a valid concept that is comprised of 10 sub-traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants’ total scores on the test also correlated with their scores on the main five personality traits (that is, with higher extraversion, agreeableness, emotional stability, openness and conscientiousness) and with the meta-trait of “stability”, indicative of an ability to avoid impulses in the pursuit of one’s goals. That the new test corresponded in this way with established personality measures provides further evidence of its validity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Kaufman turned to modern theories of well-being, such as self-determination theory, to see if people’s scores on his self-actualisation scale correlated with these contemporary measures. Sure enough, he found that people with more characteristics of self-actualisation also tended to score higher on curiosity, life-satisfaction, self-acceptance, personal growth and autonomy, among other factors – just as Maslow would have predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Taken together, this total pattern of data supports Maslow’s contention that self-actualised individuals are more motivated by growth and exploration than by fulfilling deficiencies in basic needs,” Kaufman writes. He adds that the new empirical support for Maslow’s ideas is “quite remarkable” given that Maslow put them together with “a paucity of actual evidence”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A criticism often levelled at Maslow’s notion of self-actualisation is that its pursuit encourages an ego-centric, selfish focus on one’s own goals and needs. However, Maslow always contended that it is only through becoming our true, authentic selves that we can transcend the self and look outward with compassion to the rest of humanity. Kaufman explored this too and found that higher scorers on his characteristics of self-actualisation scale tended to also score higher on feelings of oneness with the world, but not on decreased self-salience (the two main factors in a modern measure of self-transcendence developed by David Yaden).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaufman said this last finding supports “…Maslow’s contention that self-actualising individuals are able to paradoxically merge with a common humanity while at the same time able to maintain a strong identity and sense of self.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the new data contradict Maslow is on the demographic factors that correlate with characteristics of self-actualisation – he thought that self-actualisation was rare and almost impossible for young people. Kaufman, by contrast, found scores on his new scale to be normally distributed through his sample (that is spread evenly like height or weight) and unrelated to factors like age, gender and educational attainment (although in personal correspondence, Kaufman informs me that newer data – over 3000 people have now taken the new test – is showing a small, but statistically significant association between older age and having more characteristics of self-actualisation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concluding his paper, Kaufman writes that “[H]opefully the current study … brings Maslow’s motivational framework and the central personality characteristics described by the founding humanistic psychologists, into the 21st century.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new test is sure to reinvigorate Maslow’s ideas, but if this is to help heal our divided world, then the characteristics required for self-actualisation, rather than being a permanent feature of our personalities, must be something we can develop deliberately. I put this point to Kaufman and he is optimistic. “I think there is significant room to develop these characteristics [by changing your habits],” he told me. “A good way to start with that,” he added, “is by first identifying where you stand on those characteristics and assessing your weakest links. Capitalize on your highest characteristics but also don’t forget to intentionally be mindful about what might be blocking your self-actualization. … Identify your patterns and make a concerted effort to change. I do think it’s possible with conscientiousness and willpower.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scottbarrykaufman.com/characteristics-of-self-actualization-scale/&quot;&gt;Take the new test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A picture is worth a thousand words…. When it comes to conveying a concept, this sentiment can&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;certainly be true. But it may also be the case for memory. At least that’s the message from Myra Fernandes and colleagues at the University of Waterloo, Canada – &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0963721418755385&quot;&gt;writing in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Current Directions in Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, they argue that their research programme shows that drawing has a “surprisingly powerful influence” on memory, and as a mnemonic technique, it could be particularly useful for older adults – and even people with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35335&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernandes and her colleagues first established what they call the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/04/08/want-to-remember-something-draw-it/&quot;&gt;drawing effect&lt;/a&gt;” – getting people to draw quick pictures of words in a list (such as “truck” or “pear”) led to much better recall of those words than writing them out multiple times. Creating just a four-second drawing was also superior to imagining the items or viewing pictures of the words.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was proof of principle type work. The researchers next looked at whether drawing aids memory of more complex terms and concepts. They found that study participants who had a minute to draw an image representing “isotope” or “spore”, for example, were more likely to remember the meaning than people who were asked to copy out the definitions instead. “As with single words, we reasoned that drawing facilitates retention, at least in part, because it requires elaboration on the meaning of the term and translating the definition to a new form (a picture),” the researchers write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are various components to the process of drawing a picture of a word or concept, each of which seem to cumulatively aid memory. Getting people to trace over an existing drawing (so getting them to make relevant arm and hand movements, but not allowing personal elaboration), or to create a drawing which they were then not allowed to see (so allowing the physical movements and personal elaboration, but depriving them of the visual memory of the end result) both improved memory – but not as much as when all of these stages were allowed. “Memory scaled up as components were added to the encoding task,” the researchers note.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernandes and her colleagues went on to find that although older adults performed worse than younger adults at remembering words they had learned by writing, there was no difference between the two age groups in their ability to remember words they had drawn. Encouraged by these results, the team then asked 13 people diagnosed with dementia and living in a long-term care facility to either draw or write 60 words that were read aloud by an experimenter. The results showed a “massive” memory benefit for words that had been drawn rather than written. If it can be shown that drawing also helps with other sorts of memory – for where things are kept, perhaps –&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;this strategy could be practically useful for people with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the patients’ drawings looked just like scribbles. But how good – or bad – the drawings were didn’t seem to matter. In fact, in most of the experiments, the researchers assessed their participants’ ability to create vivid images and also their experience at drawing, and neither was correlated with memory performance. Even people who struggle to create a stick figure should, then, get memory benefits from drawing.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s still plenty of work to be done to investigate whether drawing terms, events or concepts that you want to recall can bring real-world benefits – whether in the classroom or in a care home. But this is a comprehensive set of studies, all pointing in the same direction. “Taken together, the evidence…demonstrates that drawing is a robust encoding strategy that can, and does, improve memory performance dramatically,” the researchers conclude.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0963721418755385&quot;&gt;The Surprisingly Powerful Influence of Drawing on Memory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Not finding a permanent job? Getting a divorce and losing your family? Losing your funding? Not making this month's rent? Not having a roof over your head? Natural disasters? Nuclear war? Cancer? Having a loved one die of cancer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAILURE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many types of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/specific-phobias/symptoms-causes/syc-20355156&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;specific phobias&lt;/a&gt; (snakes, spiders, heights, enclosed spaces, &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2008/01/tears-of.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;clowns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2014/11/fright-week-fear-of-mirrors.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mirrors&lt;/a&gt;, etc.), but that's not what I'm talking about here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are you &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; afraid of? Death? Pain? A painful death?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devils, demons, ghosts, witches, and other supernatural apparitions? This latter category (haunting, demon possession) is common among many cultures with religious or spiritual practices, and can evoke primal fear. As a former Catholic, I am still frightened by movies or TV shows that involve demonic possession, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Horror_Story:_Asylum&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Horror Story: Asylum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Hks32ujh_Rs/UPscwLxX9gI/AAAAAAAAIB4/OxELoCq2-Ck/s1600/AHSA+exorcism.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot; title=&quot;American Horror Story: Asylum on FX&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Hks32ujh_Rs/UPscwLxX9gI/AAAAAAAAIB4/OxELoCq2-Ck/s320/AHSA+exorcism.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this show as an exemplar in a post about &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/01/possession-trance-disorder-in-dsm-5.html&quot;&gt;Possession Trance Disorder in DSM-5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fantastic long-form article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/author/mike-mariani/&quot;&gt;Nike Mariani&lt;/a&gt; has just appeared in &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt;. The author intermixes the individual case study of Louisa Muskovits with the history of exorcism and facts about its modern-day resurgence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/12/catholic-exorcisms-on-the-rise/573943/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;American Exorcism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Priests are fielding more requests than ever for help with demonic possession, and a centuries-old practice is finding new footing in the modern world.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The official exorcist for Indianapolis has received 1,700 requests so far in 2018. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Father Thomas said that as many as 80 percent of the people who come to him seeking an exorcism are sexual-abuse survivors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some abused children are subjected to such agonizing experiences that  they adopt a coping mechanism in which they force themselves into a kind  of out-of-body experience. As they mature, this extreme psychological  measure develops into a disorder that may manifest unpredictably. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;“There  is a high prevalence of childhood abuse of different kinds with  dissociative disorders,”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Roberto Lewis-Fernández, a Columbia University  psychiatry professor who studies dissociation, told me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings me to another topic I've been meaning to write about for weeks. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis&quot;&gt;Sleep paralysis&lt;/a&gt; is the terrifying condition of being half awake but unable to move (or speak or scream). It can feel like you're frozen in bed, aware of your surroundings yet completely paralyzed. This  is because the complete muscle atonia typically experienced during &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REM_sleep&quot; title=&quot;Rapid Eye Movement sleep&quot;&gt;REM sleep&lt;/a&gt; has oozed into lighter stages of &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-REM_sleep&quot; title=&quot;Non-REM sleep&quot;&gt;non-REM sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Scary dream imagery can intrude while in this state, making it even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fascinating new paper covers interpretations of this frightening phenomenon across different cultures (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6082011/?report=printable&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Olunu et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;). A common theme is being attacked, visited, or sat upon by supernatural beings, such as demons, witches, ghosts, and spirits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;-- click on image for a larger view --&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Korm5YY50fQ/W-iJLfAyx8I/AAAAAAAAMro/Y9Z08I30EYYU3JGq65tKcOR1VaOA3jnjACLcBGAs/s1600/Sleep%2Bparalysis_edit.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1050&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1050&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Korm5YY50fQ/W-iJLfAyx8I/AAAAAAAAMro/Y9Z08I30EYYU3JGq65tKcOR1VaOA3jnjACLcBGAs/s400/Sleep%2Bparalysis_edit.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eerie presences are called &lt;i&gt;Jinn&lt;/i&gt; in Egypt, &lt;i&gt;Kabus&lt;/i&gt; in Iran, &lt;i&gt;Phi Um&lt;/i&gt; in Thailand, &lt;i&gt;Old Hag&lt;/i&gt; in lots of places, and the especially horrifying &lt;i&gt;Kokma&lt;/i&gt;  in Saint Lucia, which are “attacks by dead spirits or unbaptized babies that jump into a body and squeeze the throat”. In Nigeria, believers in supernatural explanations exist alongside others who hold rational explanations: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Nigerians describe it as “visitation of an evil spirit, witches, or some form of spiritual attack.” Others have beliefs that it may be due to anxiety or emotions associated with family problems. &lt;/blockquote&gt;The Wikipedia page on the folklore of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_hag#Folklore&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;night hag&lt;/a&gt; also has a pretty good listing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, sleep paralysis was considered as a partial explanation for “demonic possession” in the case of Louisa Muskovits (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/12/catholic-exorcisms-on-the-rise/573943/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Atlantic&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Louisa seemed to vacillate between this unhinged state and her normal  self. One minute she would snarl and bare her teeth, and the next she  would beg for help. “It definitely had this appearance where she was  fighting within herself,” Harp [her former therapist] told me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. . . &lt;br /&gt;[Another time] Louisa ... woke  up abruptly, only to find her body locked in place—but with the added  shock of what seemed to be visual hallucinations, including one of a  giant spider crawling into her bedroom. Louisa was so jolted that she  barely ate or slept for three days. “I didn’t feel safe,” she said. “I felt violated.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. . .&lt;br /&gt;Sleep paralysis seemed like a promising explanation. A phenomenon in which sufferers move too quickly in and out of rem sleep for the body to keep up, sleep paralysis causes a person’s mind to wake up before the body can shake off the effects of sleep. Hovering near full consciousness, the person can experience paralysis and hallucinations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Louisa didn’t think this could account for the hand on her collarbone, which she swore she’d felt while she was completely awake [&lt;i&gt;oh of course it can account for this phenomenology!&lt;/i&gt;].&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;What are your experiences of sleep paralysis?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further Reading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/12/when-waking-up-becomes-nightmare.html&quot;&gt;When Waking Up Becomes the Nightmare: Hypnopompic Hallucinatory Pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2011/09/phenomenology-of-pain-during-rem-sleep.html&quot;&gt;The Phenomenology of Pain During REM Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2011/09/neurophysiology-of-pain-during-rem.html&quot;&gt;The Neurophysiology of Pain During REM Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/01/possession-trance-disorder-in-dsm-5.html&quot;&gt;Possession Trance Disorder in DSM-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/01/spirit-possession-as-trauma-related.html&quot;&gt;Spirit Possession as a Trauma-Related Disorder in Uganda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-spirit-came-for-me-when-i-went-to.html&quot;&gt;&quot;The spirit came for me when I went to fetch firewood&quot; - Personal Narrative of Spirit Possession in Uganda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/08/possession-trance-disorder-caused-by.html&quot;&gt;Possession Trance Disorder Caused by Door-to-Door Sales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2012/05/fatal-hypernatraemia-from-exessive-salt.html&quot;&gt;Fatal Hypernatraemia from Excessive Salt Ingestion During Exorcism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2010/10/diagnostic-criteria-for-demonic.html&quot;&gt;Diagnostic Criteria for Demonic Possession&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/10/the-devilish-side-of-psychiatry.html&quot;&gt;The Devilish Side of Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reference&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olunu E, Kimo R, Onigbinde EO, Akpanobong MU, Enang IE, Osanakpo M, Monday IT, Otohinoyi DA, John Fakoya AO.

&lt;p&gt;And what a varied career it has already been: an alumnus of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mindhacks.com&quot;&gt;Mind Hacks&lt;/a&gt; group of young bloggers that formed in 2004, Alex completed a PhD at UCL in 2005 in the area of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09658210600747241&quot;&gt;autobiographical memory&lt;/a&gt; before entering the world of occupational psychology as a consultant and, in 2011, establishing the popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://bps-occupational-digest.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;BPS Occupational Digest&lt;/a&gt; (later incorporated into the main Research Digest). Alongside all this, he is an admired teacher and performer in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/index.php/projects/improvisation-and-theatre/&quot;&gt;improvised theatre&lt;/a&gt;. His creativity, and his diverse experiences and expertise have always shone through in his reports for the Research Digest (thank you Alex!). We wish him the very best in his new role working in the NHS in a therapeutic capacity as he begins the path towards becoming a clinical psychologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To celebrate his writings for the Research Digest, here are Alex’s greatest hits (in terms of audience page views), covering research on sexual posing to the importance of critical thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/17/brainwave-study-suggests-sexual-posing-but-not-bare-skin-leads-to-automatic-objectification/&quot;&gt;Brainwave study suggests sexual posing, but not bare skin, leads to automatic objectification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex’s departure means that we have a vacancy on our team. If you think you could be the person to fill his shoes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/30/were-seeking-a-writer-to-join-our-team-2/&quot;&gt;here is more information&lt;/a&gt; on the role and how to apply (closing date Nov 30, 2018).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jessesingal.com/&quot;&gt;Jesse Singal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;How important is your country, really? It’s a pointed question, especially with Brexit looming and the reinvigoration of nationalistic movements in the U.S. and EU. So it feels like a fitting time to look at a creative study that evaluated differences in, well, national self-importance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211368118300202&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“We Made History: Citizens of 35 Countries Overestimate Their Nation’s Role in World History”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, a team led by Franklin M. Zaromb of Israel’s National Authority for Measurement and Evaluation in Education surveyed thousands of students across the world to better gauge their beliefs about world history and their countries’ place in it. (You can view the survey itself &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/wj378/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35348&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A subset of the students — 6,185 from 35 countries once fishy and incomplete responses were excluded — were asked “What contribution do you think the country you are living in has made to world history?” They were instructed to respond with a percentage from 0 to 100. (“Participants were all citizens of their respective countries,” the authors note — no exchange students here.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As Zaromb’s team acknowledge, this is a somewhat odd question. There is of course no way to assign a percentage of history-making to a given country in anything like an objective or rigorous way (how many &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://singingrevolution.com/about-the-history&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Singing Revolutions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; equals one Pearl Harbour?). But that was sort of the point: The goal of the survey was to better understand students’ potential feelings of “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/12/09/theres-such-a-thing-as-collective-narcissism-and-it-might-explain-a-lot-thats-going-on-at-the-moment/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;collective narcissism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;” or “the phenomenon of people showing excessive pride in one’s own group”, as well as the biases that go into making numerically noisy judgements. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;One could be forgiven for imagining that my fellow Americans, more than the citizens of other nations, would be the ones to view their country as the most historically important. After all, the concept of “American exceptionalism” is pretty baked into U.S. culture. But as it turned out, Americans were in the bottom half — on average, those students, who were from Washington University in St. Louis, estimated that their country contributed 29.6 per cent of world history. That’s of course a ridiculous overestimate — especially given that the U.S., having been founded as an independent nation in 1776, has only been around for a tiny fraction of human history — but 29.6 per cent was a positively humble estimate relative to those made by students from the countries with the three highest average estimates: Russia (60.8 per cent), the U.K. (54.6 per cent), and India (53.9 per cent). The three humblest (relatively speaking) countries were Switzerland (11.3 per cent), Norway (12.3 per cent), and New Zealand (17.7 per cent). By any conceivably reasonable standard, of course, these are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; overestimates. The researchers dubbed this apparently universal (at least among these samples) tendency to overrate the historical importance of one’s country’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;national narcissism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The researchers also asked the respondents questions geared at measuring their levels of national pride and loyalty to see how that was related to their level of national narcissism. And while there was a statistically significant correlation between the two, it wasn’t all that large (r = .2, meaning national pride/loyalty could explain 4 per cent of the variance in the estimates of national narcissism), and it was quite heterogeneous: For many countries it was significantly larger or smaller than r = .2, or wasn’t statistically significant at all (for what it’s worth, there was no country where the correlation was both negative and significant).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;While the findings here are certainly interesting, there are many limitations to keep in mind. These aren’t true national averages, for one thing, since the samples, all drawn from a single university per country, are quite susceptible to selection bias: In the U.S., for example, Washington University in St. Louis is a highly ranked school known for having a fairly wealthy student body. Students there might have a very different view about America’s contributions to history than what one might find surveying a different slice of Americans (in case you’re wondering, the U.K. sample attended Brunel University, London). The study’s entire sample also skewed rather female (60.2 per cent), for what that’s worth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;But it’s still interesting that students from 35 nations calculated that their nations were, in sum, responsible for 1,156.4 per cent of human history. What can this tell us?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A couple of things, potentially. As Zaromb and his colleagues point out, this could be seen as an example of the availability heuristic — a cognitive error in which we overestimate certain things because we can so easily call examples to mind. In this case, the respondents, being students, were likely able to come up with many examples of historically important things that involved their country — Norwegian students learn Norwegian history, after all — and as a result overestimated the historical importance of their homelands. Now, as the authors note, the question about percentages did come near the end of a longer survey in which respondents were also “asked about their knowledge of important historical figures and events from around the world”, based on a “list of 40 people and events [that were] distributed throughout the world, with no one country dominant”. In theory, this might have reduced the impact of the availability heuristic, since it would prime respondents to think of events in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; countries. But by that same token, citizens of the biggest countries saw their countries &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;over-represented&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; on that list. By my count, for example, 10 of the 20 events directly involved the U.S. For an American student, then, the list could run the risk of actually exacerbating the availability heuristic, since it contains so many examples of historical events that directly involved the U.S. (A Swiss or Norwegian student, on the other hand, wouldn’t be similarly primed, though perhaps being exposed to many historical events could cause them to think about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;their countries’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; responses to those events.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This study could also be seen as evidence for a cousin of the famous &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/culture-conscious/201205/occupy-lake-wobegon&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Lake Wobegon effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, or the tendency of people to overestimate their abilities, leading a majority of individuals to view themselves as “above average” in various domains. It shouldn’t be surprising, given what we know about in-group psychology, that people often err similarly when evaluating their own groups relative to others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It would be fascinating to see a study like this repeated on a larger, more cross-nationally representative group of respondents. One could make a case for more highly educated people both overestimating or underestimating their countries’ historical importance, relative to less educated ones (maybe the highly educated, knowing more history, are hit harder by the availability heuristic — or maybe they’re simply better with numbers, so the less educated would make even &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;higher &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;estimates).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As of now, the researchers admit they aren’t quite sure why they found what they found. “None of our measures accounted for much of the variance [in national narcissism], nor were estimates especially inflated in individualistic societies compared to collectivistic societies… National narcissism was higher in materialistic, more collectivistic and hierarchical cultures, but explained variance was small.” There’s a lot more work to be done to better understand this phenomenon, in other words, and the first step will be to harvest data from bigger, more nationally representative samples.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211368118300202&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We Made History: Citizens of 35 Countries Overestimate Their Nation’s Role in World History&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/laptop-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health professionals express concern when we see patients influenced by medical misinformation. We know that poor-quality information is convenient and widespread. We worry that it will lead people down pathways that diverge from professional guidance. We are uneasy when we consider the potentially devastating health effects of such deviations. We have seen first-hand howmisinformation can negatively influence health behaviors in areas like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/health-45990874&quot;&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/kavinsenapathy/2016/12/23/naturalnonsense-friends-dont-let-friends-read-natural-news/&quot;&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators express &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/may/13/should-university-students-use-wikipedia&quot;&gt;frustration&lt;/a&gt; when we see students use abundant, lower quality sources of information while they are training. We watch as they collectively cut corners, meaning the trails of their habits are self-reinforced. With health professional students, we fear the resulting lack of practice in using high quality evidence will influence medical decision-making in patient care. Furthermore, we find that after graduation, even those who can use strong health evidence often cannot adapt medical terminology to meet the literacy needs of their patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we do about these challenges? We can sigh, grumble, and finger point. We can lecture our patients and our trainees about the woes of seeking medical information from the same sources they use to find information about their hobbies, pop culture, politics, and the like. We can shout that clinicians don’t communicate information at a level appropriate to the lay public, driving the most vulnerable to the sources that do. We can keep teaching the way we have been teaching, watching the distance between educators and students grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or we can respect that patients, health professionals, and students have chosen their preferred route. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiedu.org/blog/2016/10/27/new-videos-feature-ucsf-faculty-encouraging-others-to-teach-with-wikipedia/&quot;&gt;We can advocate for new methods&lt;/a&gt;. Wikipedia is the most used online resource for health information worldwide. Although it was not originally intended to provide health information, it has proved to be what transportation planners call a “desire path,” i.e., an informal shortcut created to more easily arrive at a destination (see Figure 1). This desire path has become well-trodden. So why not legitimize and strengthen it by teaching health professional students to edit and improve Wikipedia pages? Why not use tools designed specifically for that purpose to monitor the impact of their edits? When we pave this desire path, we have the potential for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29683009&quot;&gt;dual benefits&lt;/a&gt; – both students and patients can learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10687&quot; style=&quot;width: 411px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-10687&quot; height=&quot;267&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/walking-trail-1031654_1920-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;401&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on the example of an innovative &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/business/media/editing-wikipedia-pages-for-med-school-credit.html&quot;&gt;Wikipedia editing elective&lt;/a&gt; at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) School of Medicine, we saw an opportunity to improve a traditional educational activity in the UCSF School of Pharmacy. Instead of the usual academic practice of having pharmacy students write and edit summaries of key information about new medicines, we had them improve information about specific medicines posted on Wikipedia. We then evaluated whether they developed the professional communication skills expected, and at the same time provided better information to a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project we used as a role model, which involved UCSF medical students, included up to a dozen self-selected students completing an intensive elective unit, in which individual Wikipedia editing was the only academic commitment. For our pharmacy project, we were interested in determining whether similar outcomes were achievable on a larger scale. Our study enlisted an entire class cohort of more than 100 students. Wikipedia editing was only one of many assignments the students completed in across multiple classes during that term. To compensate for these competing demands, the pharmacy students worked in small groups and received support through peer training. For a summary of the Wikipedia-inclusive medical and pharmacy courses at UCSF, see Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that editing medicines-related Wikipedia pages as an educational activity can improve both public-facing information and student communication skills. The impact of the student edits on the Wikipedia pages was substantial; demonstrated by improvements in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the medicines pages and increased page views, which amplified the results of the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10689&quot; style=&quot;width: 337px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-10689&quot; height=&quot;218&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/office-594132_1920-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;327&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also found that students learned more about the inner workings of Wikipedia and, as a result, many viewed this resource differently. A few said that they would consider editing Wikipedia pages again in the future, suggesting that this type of assignment can motivate continued efforts to improve public health information outside of formal assignments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encouraging pharmacy students to play a role in improving health-related Wikipedia pages is both valuable and feasible. We suspect the dual benefit to students and to society is not limited to pharmacy. We call on other health professional education programs to embrace these “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.litsl.com/personal/commercial_success_by_looking_for_desire_lines.pdf&quot;&gt;perfect expressions of natural purpose&lt;/a&gt;” by adapting traditional health information assignments to include Wikipedia editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This project was supported by a partnership with the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiedu.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wiki Education Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_Project_Med&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wiki Project Medicine Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Pharmacology&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wiki Project Pharmacology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. We used &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;freely available tools&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; designed specifically to support using Wikipedia for formal instruction. Through similar partnerships, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-wikipedia-science-classes-adv-snap-story.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;university students are increasingly improving science information on the Internet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and making real-world impact through their work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In western nations, the vast majority of sexually active women take the birth control pill at some point in their lives, usually to avoid becoming pregnant. Of increasing interest to some psychologists, the hormone-stabilising effects of the pill may have other important effects, including on the psyche and personal relationships, and these are the focus of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0941950018301763&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Neurology, Psychiatry and Brain Research. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some earlier studies found that women who take the pill report more emotional stability, in terms of experiencing &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/178/9/1378/90917&quot;&gt;fewer depressive symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00737-014-0453-4&quot;&gt;fewer mental health problems more generally&lt;/a&gt; (of course this is not true of all women, in fact some women &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/20/mood-swings-more-than-pms-contraceptive-pill-alice-roberts&quot;&gt;describe&lt;/a&gt; unwanted emotional effects from the pill). There also appear to be what Tenille Taggart at San Diego State University and her colleagues refer to as “downstream benefits” of taking the pill, including greater relationship &lt;a href=&quot;http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/279/1732/1430&quot;&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.a.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;amp;profile=ehost&amp;amp;scope=site&amp;amp;authtype=crawler&amp;amp;jrnl=21648204&amp;amp;AN=117856159&amp;amp;h=e2MK%2bOQRmwi2fc0xMPPeE7Rtzt2GS36ly0qPhqxROMh8PLDMh6K73yoHLT%2b1cTd2MOQQ9eQMknltLe0lzARNcQ%3d%3d&amp;amp;crl=c&amp;amp;resultNs=AdminWebAuth&amp;amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&amp;amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d21648204%26AN%3d117856159&quot;&gt;satisfaction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, before now, no study has measured these two outcomes (emotional stability and relationship satisfaction) simultaneously. Taggart’s team have done this and their results suggest that a key reason that women who take the pill (oral contraceptives; OCs) tend to enjoy more satisfying relationships is because they have more stable emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results support previous findings that OCs may confer positive psychological benefits, and that one of these, mood stability, may have diffuse effects on women’s broader wellbeing and functioning,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35240&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research involved 282 women (average age 26-27 years) recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk survey website. One hundred and ninety-nine of the women were not taking the oral contraceptive pill, while the remaining 83 were (and had been for an average of 33 months).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women reported whether they experience mood swings, how often and how severely. They also answered questions about their relationship satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent with previous research, on average the women taking the pill reported fewer and less severe mood swings, and they had more satisfying relationships. Statistically speaking, Taggart and her team described the size of these group differences as “notable”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel finding was that the greater emotional stability among the women on the pill mediated the greater relationship satisfaction they reported – that is, statistical analysis suggested that the greater relationship satisfaction in the group on the pill was partly explained by their also tending to have more stable emotions. In fact, 44 per cent of the variance in the women’s relationship satisfaction was accounted for by differences in their emotional stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeper analysis suggested it was specifically having fewer and less serious up and down mood swings that was related to relationship satisfaction, not having less negative emotion or more positive emotion per se. The researchers speculated that intensity and frequency of negative emotion may be more akin to a personality trait, and that it is specifically emotional lability (mood swings) that is reduced by the birth control pill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said their findings “support public policy efforts aimed at providing broad, affordable access to contraceptives, including for non-contraceptive benefits, and discussing OCs as a potential treatment with all women, including those not at imminent risk for pregnancy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others may worry that any potential benefits from this line of research would be outweighed by the stigmatising effect of spreading the idea that women’s emotions (rather than, say, gender inequality) are a problem that needs addressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even for supporters of this research endeavour, more data is clearly needed, especially long-term studies that follow women (and ideally their partners too) over time, so that causal factors can be identified with more confidence. With the current cross-sectional design other interpretations of the results are feasible – for instance, perhaps it is relationship satisfaction that influences women’s choice to take the pill and also reduces their emotional lability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0941950018301763&quot;&gt;Oral contraceptive use is associated with greater mood stability and higher relationship satisfaction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/04/Power-to-the-Preprint_blog-image-002-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dedicated team of Editorial Board Members are now actively seeking manuscripts in the Earth Sciences from preprint servers &lt;a href=&quot;https://eartharxiv.org/&quot;&gt;EarthArXiv&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.essoar.org/&quot;&gt;ESSoar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preprint servers offer a myriad of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/why-preprint&quot;&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; to authors who are excited to share their work with the community as soon as possible, so we’ve offered our authors the ease of automatically posting their life science submissions on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/&quot;&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a community of many different voices and we want to help promote preprints in all disciplines. This includes providing authors with more reasons to post a preprint – on top of the advantages that posting a preprint already offer such as faster dissemination and allowing for input from the whole community. We’re therefore delighted to announce the introduction of a new program to invite submissions of posted preprint manuscripts specifically in the Earth and Space sciences. Our aim is to support authors posting their papers with a fast and efficient peer review process and journal publication of their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introducing PLOS ONE Preprint Editors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, we’ve tasked a small group of &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; Editorial Board members with reviewing and inviting preprint submissions from EarthArXiv and ESSOAr that they feel would be a good fit for the journal. This group will be led by Section Editors Guy Schumann (Bristol University, UK) and Juan Añel (University of Vigo, Spain) along with dedicated Preprint Editors, Xialoe Sun (Stockholm University, Sweden) and Julien Bouchez (Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, France).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/11/Preprint-editors_with-background.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-8389&quot; height=&quot;132&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/11/Preprint-editors_with-background.png&quot; width=&quot;285&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this program, submissions invited through preprint servers will receive special attention from the staff editors which may include extra promotion on social media. Climate change papers may also be recommended to the “Responding to Climate Change” Channel, of which Juan Añel is also an editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“As a preprint editor one can have a substantial positive impact and contribute a potentially very high added-value to the scientific community of a particular research field.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guy Schumann, Section Editor PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are truly excited to place this program in the hands of these individuals who’ve proven their dedication to their communities and eagerness to advance scholarly outputs for scientific communication in the Earth and Space sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we choose preprints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recruiting research from preprint servers is nothing new in academic publishing, other journals like &lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt; already do so. Preprints represent huge opportunities for improvement on slow publication times. When it comes to critical issues like climate change and others, getting results out sooner can have a dramatic impact on our ability to advance science and foster early collaboration and debate on new research results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“For me, a main advantage of preprints is that they can help to advance science faster, with public exposure of what is going on, what is cutting-edge”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Juan Añel, Section Editor PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve never posted a preprint before, should I?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! The benefits are endless. Preprints are an easy way to generate exposure for your research before you even decide where to submit (ESSOAr also accepts uploads of conference posters and other materials). When you post a preprint, you have immediate and unlimited reach allowing you stake the first claim on your methods and results, and even get early feedback from your community. Sounds great, right? Preprints are also beneficial for early career researchers who need discoverable, citable content that speaks to their academic contributions and can help advance their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Particularly for young scientists, who are the major driving force for science today and need a… good publication record to look for their next job, preprints would be a very [good] choice for them to publicize their findings in a timely way and “decorate” their CV”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xiaole Sun, Preprint Editor PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to join us in our support of preprints, not just in the earth sciences but across all disciplines. Preprints are already one of the fastest growing research outputs, and we can all do our part to making it an even more successful outlet for new communities that are just beginning to explore its potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost half of people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) have extreme fears about touching something they feel is “contaminated”. This can mean that after touching a doorknob, say, they then feel compelled to scrub their hands, in some cases even until they bleed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional treatments, which often involve a combination of a prescription drug (typically an “SSRI”, such as Prozac) plus cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), help &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonathanhaverkampf.ie/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Treatment-Resistant-OCD-CJ-Haverkampf-J-Psychiatry-Psychotherapy-Communication-2014-Sep-30-3391-94.pdf&quot;&gt;only about 60 per cent of people&lt;/a&gt; with OCD, so there’s an urgent need for additional treatments. Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-33142-2&quot;&gt;in &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Baland Jalal at the University of Cambridge and colleagues present initial data suggesting that a simple video intervention, delivered via a phone app, might help.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35289&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this exploratory study, the researchers recruited 93 people from the local community with higher than average fears about contamination but without a diagnosis of OCD. The researchers made this recruitment decision in case their experimental treatment inadvertently worsened their participants’ symptoms, which would likely have been more serious for people with full OCD. But thankfully, as hoped, their intervention was helpful – after just a week, participants in the two intervention groups showed significant improvements, whereas members of the control group did not.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial began with all the participants completing an initial battery of questionnaires and a clinical interview. The participants in the two intervention groups were then videoed for 30 seconds either touching toilet paper inside a bedpan that had been mocked up to look and smell as though it contained faeces, or washing their hands in a sink. The control participants were videoed making arbitrary hand gestures. These videos were then loaded into a smart-phone app, and on four occasions each day over the next 7 days, all the participants were then prompted, via the app, to watch their personalised video.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching the bedpan video was designed to be a potentially much less confronting, less time-consuming (and also less expensive) version of standard exposure-based CBT therapy. This involves progressively exposing the client to a “contaminated” object (like a toilet seat), which generates anxiety – but preventing them from washing themselves. By allowing clients to feel the eventual decrease in their anxiety levels, even in the absence of the washing, therapists help them to learn to overcome their contamination fears. The hand-washing video was designed with the hope that it would allow a kind of vicarious cleansing, assuaging the individual’s concerns about contamination without them having to actually go and wash their hands.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the eighth day, all the participants came back into the lab for follow-up testing. Both intervention groups showed a significant decrease in OCD symptoms, measured using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. They also got better at a test of cognitive flexibility, which entails being able to shift attention as a situation changes. Their scores on the contamination fears scale did not decrease, but that might be because a week wasn’t long enough for them to recognise changes within themselves, the researchers suggest. (Members of the control group showed no changes on any of the measures.)&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several participants described their own experiences. One in the hand-washing condition reported: “It felt as if I had washed my hands, so I didn’t need to wash my hands anymore…my hands were clean after using the app”. A member of the bedpan group said: “I have become desensitised to the video and other things as well. If I normally were to wipe a kitchen worktop, I would throw the cloth away because I felt it was disgusting to clean that cloth for another time. But since using the app I now use the cloth, clean it, and use it again another time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is of course to investigate whether these interventions really can work as a treatment for OCD. As the researchers write, they are certainly worth investigating further, in part because they “are not only inexpensive and accessible but can be tailored for individual patients. They also have the potential for widespread implementation and could potentially reach communities that do not have access to adequate mental health care.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-33142-2&quot;&gt;Novel Smartphone Interventions Improve Cognitive Flexibility and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Symptoms in Individuals with Contamination Fears&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2018-11-19T09:00:08+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/AdobeStock_86183613-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle and healthcare interaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that modifiable lifestyle factors such as smoking, being overweight or obese and drinking alcohol are related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2018/03/23/new-calculations-confirm-lifestyle-changes-could-prevent-4-in-10-cancer-cases/&quot;&gt;4 out of 10 cancers&lt;/a&gt; and men are more likely to have at least one or more of these risk factors. Taking tobacco as an example, smoking in men has had a significant impact on the rates of certain cancer types, particularly lung, head and neck, bowel, bladder, pancreatic – cancers that can have particularly poor outcomes. Fortunately, smoking rates in men are now steadily falling and we’re starting to see a subsequent decline in the incidence of some of these cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another potential reason is that men are less likely to have as many opportunities for contact with health professionals across their lifetime in order to obtain health information or to report possible cancer-related symptoms. Women are more likely to have frequent contact on matters relating to contraception, pregnancy, child rearing or menopause and they have also had exposure to healthcare professional through participating in breast (and cervical) cancer screening for the past three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, men have only recently had the opportunity to participate in such programs in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bowel-cancer-screening/&quot;&gt;bowel cancer screening&lt;/a&gt;, but the test is conducted at home, which further limits opportunities for healthcare professional contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex differences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about inherent differences between the sexes, could they be responsible for some of these differences in cancer rates? Sex hormones, including oestrogens (the primary female sex hormone) and testosterone (the primary male sex hormone), are related to sex-specific cancers such as breast in women and prostate in men but surprisingly, little research has been conducted to see if they are involved in the development of cancers that affect both sexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear whether these observations represent a potentially protective effect for oestrogen or a detrimental effect for testosterone – or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancers of the oesophagus (or food pipe) and stomach are particularly more common in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2407-12-11&quot;&gt;men than in women&lt;/a&gt; and are cancers which are linked to poor outcomes. The difference in rates between the sexes is especially pronounced for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/adenocarcinoma&quot;&gt;adenocarcinomas&lt;/a&gt;, the type that most commonly occurs in developed countries, with reports estimating up to a 7-fold difference in men compared to women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variation by sex is not fully explained by known risk factors such as smoking, obesity and gastroesophageal reflux and the male-to-female ratio is highest during female reproductive years, when oestrogen concentrations are highest. But it’s unclear whether these observations represent a potentially protective effect for oestrogen or a detrimental effect for testosterone – or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first study of reproductive and hormonal factors in men, we recently found that male pattern balding (used as a proxy for higher testosterone levels) was associated with a small increase in risk of &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.31375&quot;&gt;stomach cancer&lt;/a&gt; and was more marked for adenocarcinomas among men enrolled in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, a large UK cohort study. To investigate this further, we are conducting studies to examine the use of common hormone-modulating medications, in addition to circulating blood levels of sex hormones, in both men and women to see how these may impact subsequent risk of these cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research, along with the work of others, will provide insights into the possible biological reasons for the difference in oesophageal and stomach cancer rates between men and women and in the future, could lead to the identification of potentially exploitable prevention strategies. It’s important to point out though that this work is still very much in the early stages and additional research is required before any firm conclusions can be drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can men do to reduce cancer risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it is unlikely that there is one single cause as to why men develop cancer more frequently compared to women. In addition to the investigation of potential biological factors, it’s clear that we need a focus on cancer prevention and early diagnosis and campaigns such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/be-clear-on-cancer&quot;&gt;Be Clear on Cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the UK are trying to address this – but increased and sustained efforts are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on this International Men’s Day, what can men do to reduce their overall risk of developing cancer in the future? The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wcrf.org/dietandcancer/cancer-prevention-recommendations&quot;&gt;World Cancer Research Fund&lt;/a&gt;’s evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyle choices include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a healthy weight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be physically active&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat wholegrains, vegetables, fruits and beans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit the consumption of “fast-foods”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit consumption of red and processed meats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit alcohol intake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to healthy lifestyle choices, it’s important to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.org/healthy/find-cancer-early/mens-health/cancer-facts-for-men.html&quot;&gt;know yourself&lt;/a&gt;, your family history, and to tell your doctor if you notice a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-symptoms/spot-cancer-early&quot;&gt;change&lt;/a&gt; which isn’t normal for you, such as a persistent cough, change in bowel movements or difficulty swallowing.&lt;/p&gt;

 What should a doctor do if a dying patient confesses to killing people decades ago? This is the question posed by a fascinating case report in the Journal of Clinical Ethics, from New Zealand-based authors Laura Tincknell and colleagues.




The facts of the case are fairly straightforward. A 70-year old man with advanced cancer was expected to die imminently and was admitted to a hospital pallative care ward in severe pain. While being assessed by a junior doctor, the man expressed a wish</content>

 &lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;One common criticism of the open access and open science movements is that they tend to take a standardised view of science and scholarship, and so propose one-size-fits-all approaches when advocating for ways of making research and the research process more open and transparent. This often poses significant challenges for, for instance, researchers in non-STEM disciplines. It is also often deeply problematic for those based in the global South.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-O2zrNqB3vU4/W_Fup9Qi3RI/AAAAAAAAh9o/akYiLGG0Q1MmS4xYSSMwYNta9c2FmvqjwCLcBGAs/s1600/Logo.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;309&quot; data-original-width=&quot;334&quot; height=&quot;185&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-O2zrNqB3vU4/W_Fup9Qi3RI/AAAAAAAAh9o/akYiLGG0Q1MmS4xYSSMwYNta9c2FmvqjwCLcBGAs/s200/Logo.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is one of the reasons why open access has become a source of considerable conflict and divisiveness, particularly as more and more researchers find themselves subjected to increasingly demanding and standardised OA mandates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For instance, while many scientists (but by no means all) may be willing to make their work available with a CC BY licence attached, those working in arts, humanities and social science (AHSS) subjects often object strongly when told they must do so – usually for &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13555502.2013.865981?src=recsys&quot;&gt;good reasons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Likewise, the increasing move to pay-to-publish gold OA poses serious problems for those without access to the necessary funds to pay the associated publishing costs. With growing calls for a global flip of all subscription journals to a pay-to-publish model, this is now a very real issue. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Again, it is those working in AHSS and the global South who are particularly challenged by this development. In addition, it presents those journals published by learned societies with an existential threat. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Global process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is also important to bear in mind that scholarly communication is a global process and endeavour. As such, changes introduced in the global North tend to have implications for those in the South as well, often with harmful consequences. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is the possible outcome, for instance, of the current European initiative dubbed &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_S&quot;&gt;Plan S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. If it triggered a global flip to pay-to-publish (which currently seems very possible) Plan S would disenfranchise researchers based in the global South in a more fundamental way than the current subscription system does.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(For a more detailed exposition of the concerns researchers have over Plan S see this &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/plansopenletter/open-letter&quot;&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which has attracted the signature of over 1,300 researchers so far).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is important, therefore, that advocates for greater openness do not assume the world of science and scholarship to be uniform when advocating for change, and that those implementing open policies consider carefully disciplinary differences, local needs, local conditions and local practices before seeking to force change on the research community. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In short, governments and funders need to understand both the global forces at play and local conditions prior to introducing new open policies and initiatives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is therefore to be welcomed that the Centre for Innovation, Intellectual Property and Competition (&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ciipc.org/&quot;&gt;CIIPC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) in New Delhi has conducted a landscape survey of the current situation in India as concerns open science (although due to feasibility concerns, the sample was restricted to a limited number of disciplines and institutions: Economics, Law, Mechanical Engineering, Medicine, and Physics were). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study’s principal investigator was Arul George Scaria, Assistant Professor of Law and Co-Director at CIIPC, and he is currently working on a report based on the survey (available in draft form &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/aj9gw/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the interview with me below Arul George Scaria explains what the survey discovered and what recommendations the report will make as a result. He also answers some additional questions I put to him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here are a few quotes from the interview, but please read the full interview to get the complete picture.

What strengths and benefits do you feel it offers over traditional methods?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AGS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Access to knowledge resources is a constant challenge in the global South, and my own experiences as a student/ researcher in India have confirmed this. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a student, I noticed that even the most resourceful libraries in India did not have access to all the essential journals and books. But I was clueless about the root causes of this crisis and its magnitude. It was never a talking point since most of my colleagues did not even realise that the crisis existed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perhaps it was internalised as one among the many life-struggles and everyday bureaucratic trials that one has to live with and undergo in a country like India. Most research mentors also did not push students to go beyond materials that are easily accessible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, when I moved for my doctoral studies to the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ip.mpg.de/en.html&quot;&gt;Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Munich, I could see how much effort a country like Germany has been putting into making knowledge more accessible to the public, in spite of the fact that Germany is a far more economically wealthy country. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here I’m talking not just about the specific open access initiatives we see in Germany, but also about the excellent network of public libraries which make knowledge accessible for the broader public. This prompted me to open myself up to the growing number of open access initiatives across the world. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Subsequently, as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Catholic University of Louvain (&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://uclouvain.be/en/index.html&quot;&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) in Belgium, under the guidance of &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://biogov.uclouvain.be/staff/dedeurwaerdere/tom.html&quot;&gt;Prof. Tom Dedeurwaerdere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, I had an opportunity to learn a lot more about diverse open movements and to read closely the works of scholars like &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom&quot;&gt;Prof. Elinor Ostrom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;All this convinced me how exigent inclusive knowledge production is for countries like India. On my return to India and my joining the National Law University in Delhi, open science naturally became a compelling research priority.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I prefer to call myself an open science advocate, as open science is a much broader movement than open access. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;With regard to the third part of your question, yes, there are obvious advantages to open access. The traditional methods of access (which remains the contemporary research scenario in India) promotes exclusivity in access to knowledge as well as in the production of knowledge. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The open science movement challenges this by trying to make knowledge production more inclusive. It advocates for broader participation in the production of knowledge through diverse open initiatives. That’s the biggest strength I see the open science movement having. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Open access vs. open science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: How would explain open access and open science – and how they differ/ interact with one another – to a layperson?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AGS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; I would say the simplest but most comprehensive definition of open access I have seen is Prof. Peter Suber’s. His definition reads: “Open-access (OA) literature is digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This definition can to a great extent also help us in differentiating open access from the broader concept of open science. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the key focus of the open access movement is to make content available free of cost online, open science goes much beyond that and tries to make knowledge production more inclusive and transparent. So, open science encompasses all the ‘open’ movements, including open access, open data, open source software, and open lab notes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I must add here that there is no single, comprehensive definition of open science. In our open science project, we defined it (based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TUgPNtjZUak753cHG0J6YnrjkR7rZpv0IteWxlbQIxI/edit#gid=223687104&quot;&gt;mapping of diverse definitions&lt;/a&gt; of open science available today) as “scientific inquiries wherein the characteristics of accessibility, transparency, usability, and non- or minimal existence of IP restrictions, are evident and exist throughout all stages of research. It is also characterised by openness to inclusiveness, collaboration, constant and continuous transfer of knowledge between producers and users of knowledge, and prioritisation of research and innovation based on social needs.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To summarise, open access is part of the broader open science movement and one cannot practise open science without open access. However, it may not be the case vice-versa. There are many scholars who have adopted open access, but they may not be practising open science. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, people may share their scientific publications through open access repositories, but they may not make their works accessible to lay-people, or they may not support collaboration. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: believe you take a particular interest in the copyright aspects of open science. What, in your view, are the implications of the current copyright regime for the open access and open science movements?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AGS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Fine-tuning the IP system – particularly copyright law – is integral to the success of the open science movement. Over the years, most countries have added more and more layers of IP protection and extended the duration of protection for most subject matter. It is high time we asked ourselves whether we should continue with this IP maximalist approach. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the specific context of copyright, it is important that we do not allow copyright law to prevent dissemination of knowledge resources. We need to broaden the exceptions and limitations under the copyright system so that we can regain a balance within the copyright system. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the context of the broader open access and open science movements, we may even have to think about a shift from today’s automatic protection regime (i.e. copyright protection doesn’t require registration) to a registration/ renewal-based system for copyright protection. This would mean that more works would be available in the public domain without access and usage restrictions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Needless to say, this would require radical changes to the current multilateral legal system.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Research findings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You were the principal investigator for the “Open Science India Report” (currently in draft form &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/aj9gw/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;). I believe this is based on a survey that set out to explore the current situation in India with regard to open science. Can you say briefly what your main findings were?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AGS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Yes, the report results from a survey we conducted among researchers in India working in different disciplines/ institutions. The data, in general, suggest that open science is yet to become a priority for most researchers. While it may not be possible to discuss all the findings, let me share some of the key findings: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The survey data show that while most researchers use publications and data which are accessible online, only a minority share their publications or data through open access repositories. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;While unwillingness to pay article processing charges (APCs) and an inability to pay these are cited by many as important factors dissuading them from sharing their publications, it is important to note that around 44% of respondents said that they would be prepared to share their data openly &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; when all the research and publications based on those data are completed. This reveals the “exclusivity” approach we currently follow with regard to knowledge resources! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In considering these responses we need also to be aware that for most researchers there will never come to a point in their academic life in which they feel that all potential research and publications based on their data have been completed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I would also note that our survey also shows that most of the researchers we surveyed did not see any benefit from sharing either publications or data!  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I noted, making knowledge production inclusive is an important aspect of open science. Unfortunately, our survey data also reveal that we as researchers are not taking sufficient steps to make science inclusive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;If we take the case of people with disabilities as an example here: we still view such people as consumers of science and not potential producers. Thus, our survey data show that although many institutions have started to provide ramp and wheelchair facilities, only around 11% provide Braille textbooks and only around 18 % provide audiobooks. Don’t we need a change in this approach? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also found that most researchers are unaware of any institutional measures for making research outputs produced in their institution accessible to people with disabilities, further indicating that there are hardly any measures taken at the institutional level in this regard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We found a similar situation with regard to communicating science in a language accessible to the broader public. The survey data show that only a small number of researchers regularly share simplified versions of their research findings. In a multilingual country like India, it is also important to communicate science in regional languages in order for it to be accessible to the broader public. While some of our policymakers, including the current Principal Scientific Advisor to the Prime Minister, have emphasised this aspect in many interviews and talks, our data show that the vast majority of respondents (around 79%) have never shared translated versions of their research in regional languages. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The survey data also provide some insights into transparency-related measures taken by respondents. While close to half of them were of the view that the failure to reproduce scientific studies is a major problem in their field, the data also indicate that there are insufficient disclosure practices on the part of researchers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;That is, while most researchers reported that they share research methodology, most of them do not appear to be routinely sharing other important information like negative results and sources of funding. Yet these are integral to addressing the reproducibility crisis in science.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our survey data also show that most respondents are unaware of any mandates from their funding agencies or institutions with regard to the disclosure of research methodology, research tools, negative results, errors in research, errors in data, and other limitations.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To summarise, the overall scenario with regard to open science practices in India is not that promising and we need to take a lot more steps to make science open.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: What recommendations do you make in the report, and to whom are these recommendations addressed?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AGS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Our main recommendations are made in Chapter 4 of the report. So, we suggest that if Indian researchers want to address the crisis in science, we need a holistic and inclusive approach involving participation from all stakeholders. Hence our chapter is addressed to all the stakeholders in science including, but not limited to, researchers, policy makers, funding agencies, and institutions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apart from providing examples wherever possible with most of our recommendations, we have also tried to specifically mention what each stakeholder can do with regard to that recommendation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This was done with the aim of not just making it easier for each stakeholder to understand what they can do, but also to convey to each stakeholder that their action is part of a broader set of actions required in that particular area.    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The main recommendations of the study include the need to create more awareness of the necessity for open science; to make openness and open science a priority in science at all levels; to introduce more robust open access, open data, open source software, and open hardware policies and practices; to have funding agencies, institutions and the government properly monitor and enforce such policies; to create shared resources; to fine-tune approaches towards IP (in particular, taking a more liberal approach to the limitations and exceptions under the copyright law); to introduce broader educational policy reforms to alleviate socio-economic barriers with regard to gender, caste, disability, etc. so as to make production of science more inclusive; to create facilities that enable the accessibility of knowledge resources for people with disabilities; to create incentives for sharing simplified and translated versions of research; to make research outputs available in machine-readable and interoperable formats; to enable a shift from pursuing sensational or “attractive” findings in favour of transparent and socially relevant research; to introduce and implement transparency-related mandates; to improve peer review; to encourage intra- and interdisciplinary collaboration; to share intermediate processes and findings; and to pursue more meaningful engagement with people outside the ‘mainstream’ scientific community. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The report also suggests the need for re-thinking the criteria used by policymakers, institutions, and funding agencies when evaluating the performance of researchers. We need a radical shift from the current approach which focuses solely on the number of publications, journal impact factor, number of patents, etc. Open science practices must be given due weight in the evaluation process. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, the report points out that it may not be advisable or possible to transplant the approaches being adopted for open science in the global North to a country like India, where access conditions and socio-economic situations are vastly different. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the context of the global South, it is also important to focus on creating offline resources, and some of the specific suggestions we put forward in the report include a greater focus on print media, community radio stations, and creation of shared physical infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Offline open access&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Can you say a little bit more about offline open access resources and who would benefit from them? I assume this is intended to inform and educate the public, and perhaps “citizen scientists”, rather than researchers? Can you give me an example? Do you see this as a peculiarly Indian need?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AGS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://indiankanoon.org/doc/560422/&quot;&gt;Art. 51 (h) of the Constitution of India&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; says that it is the duty of every citizen to develop “scientific &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dictionary.com/browse/temper&quot;&gt;temper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform”. Can the citizens of India develop this scientific state of mind without access to scientific knowledge? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a country like India, where the digital divide is substantial (some estimates suggest that only around 31% of the population in India has internet access, while a &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/16/china-outpaces-india-in-internet-access-smartphone-ownership/&quot;&gt;2017 report from Pew Research Centre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; suggest that only around 21% of adults in India use the internet at least occasionally or own a smartphone), it is extremely important to focus on alternative offline resources. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;One way of doing this would be to share simplified versions of scientific information in print form. In fact, it should be mandatory to share simplified summaries of research produced in publicly-funded research and educational institutions. So doctoral candidates defending their theses could be asked to make a short and simplified presentation of their research on the thesis defence day. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some of the more reputable universities (e.g. the &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/&quot;&gt;University of Tilburg in the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) are already insisting on this, and as a thesis examiner, I have witnessed how useful it is for both the public and the doctoral candidate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another important area where we need radical change is in providing access to libraries. In a country like India, it is important to invest in building an excellent network of public libraries across all villages and towns in the country. Every such library should be able to provide access to a good collection of books. Inter-library loans can facilitate this to a great extent, as the practices in German public libraries demonstrates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This network of libraries should also provide easy access to digital journals. The Government of India should use the power of collective bargaining to reduce the costs of both print and digital materials in this regard. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is also important to provide easy access to the libraries of publicly-funded educational institutions. While technically many of these institutions allow access to the public, they tend to put in place enormous bureaucratic procedures, including requiring recommendation and authorisation letters from faculty. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why should the public need a recommendation letter before they can access materials bought using taxpayers’ money? It is high time to challenge and change such elitist practices in educational and research institutions in India.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I briefly indicated earlier, we should also try to make use of opportunities like community radio stations to communicate science to the broader public. Maybe specific incentives could be given to educational and research institutions to encourage this. We should also encourage them to communicate science in the context of local problems, with the use of local examples. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only through such diverse efforts will we be able to develop scientific temper in the country, as envisaged under the Constitution of India.     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormalCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Who funded your survey and report? Does it have any official status, and so require a response/ action from the Indian Government or from Indian institutions/ funders/ researchers? Or is it an advisory report?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AGS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; The report is being produced under the aegis of the Centre for Innovation, IP and Competition, with the help of funding from Qualcomm Inc.

This issue has to be addressed. We need to create greater awareness in the hope of persuading more researchers to challenge the status quo. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The second issue is more complex: Some of the most experienced scientists and policymakers in India maintain strongly that there is no crisis in science in India, despite clear evidence of the magnitude of the problem. Some of them might be taking that position because they think that accepting the existence of the crisis is harmful to the image of science in India. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it is very difficult to make meaningful change when policymakers take this attitude. Accepting the existence of a problem is the most important step in addressing it, and so open science advocates need to fight to change the attitude of policymakers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;More challenges &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You said that it may not be advisable or possible to transplant the approaches to open science being developed in the Global North to a country like India. As you know, in Europe right now there is a new initiative called &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_S&quot;&gt;Plan S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. This aims to ensure that from 2020 all new research funded by a &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceeurope.org/coalition-s/&quot;&gt;growing number of funder signatories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is made freely available on the internet. Clearly, for Indian researchers as consumers of scholarly papers, it would be a positive thing if the Plan S objectives were realised. But if (as some argue it will) Plan S triggered a global flip of subscription journals to a pay-to-publish gold OA model it would presumably have a negative impact on researchers in India and the global South as authors of research, particularly if they need/want to publish in international journals. What are your views on Plan S and its likely impact on India and the global South? For instance, if pay-to-publish became the norm would not researchers in the global South find that they had to pay a lot of money to have their research published?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AGS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; I have mixed feelings about Plan S. On the positive side, it is really great to see different national research funding agencies coming together and strongly asserting that the results from publicly-funded research must be communicated through open access journals or open access platforms from January 1, 2020. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I truly hope that this will incentivise more countries to join the open access movement. Only through such collective efforts will we be able to address the global crisis in access to knowledge. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is also good to see that Plan S has taken a strong position against hybrid journals, as they often engage in double dipping (taking money both from contributors to the journal as well as from readers of the journal). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the other side, we need to ensure that initiatives like Plan S do not incentivise a complete shift to the pay-to-publish gold open access model. This would certainly be detrimental to researchers in the global South, as it would mean that most would be unable to share their research due to the exorbitant charges imposed by publishers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It would also be detrimental to science in general, since science without the perspectives and participation of the global South is incomplete science, and in many cases also misleading science! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I hope that this danger of Plan S is given due attention during the implementation planning. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;One way to address the issue is to promote green open access as a component of the implementation of Plan S – through the sharing of preprints in repositories for instance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The other option would be to support researchers in different disciplines so that they can establish open access journals that do not charge APCs. This is practically feasible today as digital communication technologies have considerably lowered the cost of disseminating knowledge. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is also important to note that most of the important aspects of the publication process (for example, the preparation of manuscripts and the review of manuscripts) are undertaken by researchers without remuneration. Given this, funding agencies could easily subsidise APC-free journals by underwriting the administration costs. It would also help establish excellent open and inclusive journals in diverse disciplines. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other modes of communication, including the sharing of simplified versions of findings through social media, should also be emphasised in initiatives like Plan S with the aim of making science more inclusive.      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You said some Indian researchers fear that the image of science in India will be harmed if they acknowledge that there is a crisis in the areas you mentioned. As you will know, pay-to-publish gold OA has encouraged the rise of a phenomenon that has been dubbed “predatory publishing”, and some maintain that India is a hotbed for predatory publishing. The Indian Government appears to have been &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06048-2&quot;&gt;struggling to tackle this problem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Others, however, argue that so-called predatory publishing is not what critics claim and that many publishers and journals in the global South have been wrongly classified as predatory. What are your views on predatory publishing, the exact nature and extent of the problem (if you accept that there is one), and the impact it is having on the Indian research community?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AGS: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Predatory publishing is an important challenge that needs to be addressed in India. Some studies have shown that India has the highest number of predatory publishers, and some show that Indian researchers are the greatest contributors to predatory journals. However, I feel these two issues need more deliberation if we want to address the challenge effectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;First, it is important to recognise that the issue of predatory publishing is not limited to open access journals. There are many closed-access publishers in India who will publish anything for a payment. So, in discussing the issue of predatory publishing we have to understand that this is an issue related to scientific publishing in general. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Second, we need to ask ourselves why predatory publishers have flourished in a country like India. And it is clear that the primary reason is the current incentive structure. When deciding whether to promote researchers most institutions in India use the Academic Performance Indicators (&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fmuniversity.nic.in/pdf/API_UGC_FORM.pdf&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) produced by the University Grants Commission (&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Grants_Commission_(India)&quot;&gt;UGC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). If one examines the API system, it is immediately evident that the focus is on quantity and not quality. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Consequently, researchers are being given the perverse incentive of increasing the number of their publications and in doing so not many will have the time or patience to focus on quality. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Was this ever the purpose of science communication? The situation is alarming and only by means of radical change to the current incentive structure will we be able to address this issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: You said earlier that while the key focus of the open access movement is making content available free of cost online, open science goes well beyond this and aims to make the whole knowledge production process more inclusive and transparent, including making things like lab notes freely available online. You will perhaps know that there is today some concern among OA advocates at the way in which legacy publishers like Elsevier are acquiring more and more of the knowledge production infrastructure – including services that are essentially a product of the open access movement (e.g. Mendeley and SSRN) – as well as traditional pieces of the publishing infrastructure such as publication workflow solutions like &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/corporate/elsevier-to-acquire-aries-systems-a-best-in-class-publication-workflow-solutions-provider&quot;&gt;Aries Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The concern is that in doing so legacy companies will be able to lock the research community into proprietary systems that will prove as expensive and controversial as the subscription &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infotoday.com/it/sep11/the-big-deal-not-price-but-cost.shtml&quot;&gt;Big Deal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. For instance, in 2016 Elsevier acquired a &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PALL&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=9,430,468.PN.&amp;amp;OS=PN/9,430,468&amp;amp;RS=PN/9,430,468&quot;&gt;peer review patent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and recently it acquired the manuscript submission and peer-review tracking system &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ariessys.com/software/editorial-manager/&quot;&gt;Editorial Manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. EM is widely used by publishers, including OA publishers like PLOS. (Elsevier’s moves in this area have been documented in &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://knowledgegap.org/index.php/sub-projects/rent-seeking-and-financialization-of-the-academic-publishing-industry/preliminary-findings/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). In light of this, we are seeing calls for “open infrastructures”. As the authors of &lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; put it, “Everything we have gained by opening content and data will be under threat if we allow the enclosure of scholarly infrastructures.” What is your take on this development, and what implications do you feel it might have for open science, particularly for those working in the global South?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AGS: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;I completely agree with the views expressed by Geoffrey Bilder, Jennifer Lin, and Cameron Neylon in ‘&lt;span class=&quot;MsoHyperlink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/&quot;&gt;Principles for Open Scholarly Infrastructures’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What we are witnessing today is the capture of shared community resources by a handful of cash-rich conglomerates who want to monopolise every aspect of science communication. We as a community need to fight back against the monopolisation of our resources. As most researchers still appear to be unaware of the long-term consequences of such monopolisation, extensive campaigns are needed in order to create awareness among researchers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We should also fight this issue legally. Antitrust law might be a useful tool in this regard, as in my view many of the actions of legacy publishers like Elsevier violate antitrust law. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Likewise, we should use the opposition procedures available under patent law to prevent frivolous patents like the peer review patent you highlighted being granted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Thank you very much for taking the time to answer my questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were working on these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issue/27&quot;&gt;NEURON&lt;/a&gt; is still a work in progress, but until it is updated to work with a
new SUNDIALS version, it cannot be packaged. There's an issue open &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/113&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/vxl&quot;&gt;vxl&lt;/a&gt; needs to be updated, but unfortunately, it is another software that
bundles an old version of a library, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/dcmtk&quot;&gt;DCMTK&lt;/a&gt;. I've filed a ticket about this
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/vxl/vxl/issues/550&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. As I've mentioned in the
ticket, I  have neither the experience with &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/dcmtk&quot;&gt;DCMTK&lt;/a&gt; nor the free cycles to
look into this issue presently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/INCF/nineml-python/issues/40&quot;&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-nineml&quot;&gt;nineml-python&lt;/a&gt;
was fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are still a few kinks to clear up before &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator&quot;&gt;NEST&lt;/a&gt; can be build with
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/issues/1063&quot;&gt;libneurosim&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/INCF/MUSIC/issues/56&quot;&gt;MUSIC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll keep at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of software available in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; already. You can see the
complete list &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/group/neuro-sig&quot;&gt;here on Fedora SCM&lt;/a&gt;. Software that is currently
being worked on is listed &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues&quot;&gt;on our Pagure project instance&lt;/a&gt;. If you use software that
is not on our list, please suggest it to us using the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://goo.gl/forms/j6AJ82yOh78MPxby1&quot;&gt;suggestion form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The effect of unethical primes on cleansing preference – positive effect sizes denote greater cleansing preference for the unethical condition than the ethical condition.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jessesingal.com/&quot;&gt;Jesse Singal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps no concept has been more important to social psychology in recent years — for good and ill — than “social priming”, or the idea, as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2016/10/13/social-priming-works-after-all/%23.W-CodZNKhPb&quot;&gt;science writer Neuroskeptic&lt;/a&gt; once put it, that “subtle cues can exert large, unconscious influences on human behaviour.” This subgenre of research has produced a steady drumbeat of interesting findings, but unfortunately, an increasing number of them are &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/16/ten-famous-psychology-findings-that-its-been-difficult-to-replicate/&quot;&gt;failing to replicate&lt;/a&gt; – including modern classics, like the idea that exposure to ageing-related words makes you walk more slowly, or that thinking about money increases your selfishness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called “Macbeth effect” is another classic example of social priming that gained mainstream recognition and acceptance from psychologists and laypeople alike. The term was first introduced by the psychologists Chen-Bo Zhong and Katie Liljenquist, who reported in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/facbios/file/Zhong%2520&amp;amp;%2520Liljenquist%25202006.pdf&quot;&gt;2006 paper in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;that “a threat to one’s moral purity induces the need to cleanse oneself”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This claim is such an interesting, provocative example of the connection between body and mind that it’s little wonder it has spread far and wide — there aren’t a lot of social-priming findings with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Macbeth_effect&quot;&gt;their own Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; (it was also covered &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/09/15/your-conscience-really-can-be-wiped-clean/&quot;&gt;here at the Research Digest&lt;/a&gt;). But is it as strong as everyone thinks? For a recent paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/1864-9335/a000349&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;in Social Psychology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the psychologists Jedediah Siev, Shelby Zuckerman, and Joseph Siev decided to find out by conducting a meta-analysis of the available papers on the Macbeth effect to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35232&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their original research, Zhong and Liljenquist found that prompting people to think of a previous bad deed they’d committed led them to exhibit “an increased mental accessibility of cleansing-related concepts, a greater desire for cleansing products, and a greater likelihood of taking antiseptic wipes”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea, then, is that someone who feels like they have committed an act of wrongdoing will be more likely, relative to a morally unsullied person, to want to wash their hands. Think Lady Macbeth in &lt;i&gt;Macbeth&lt;/i&gt;, ravaged with guilt over the murder he husband has committed: &lt;i&gt;Out, damned spot!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siev and his colleagues collected all the relevant papers they could find, both published and unpublished (to help with the latter they used the website PsychFileDrawer.org and asked around among the research community). They only included direct replication attempts of Zhong and Liljenquist’s first three studies that “examined the effects of an immoral versus moral prime on cleansing-related preferences or behaviour,” not studies that examined the effect in the other direction, nor broader, so-called “conceptual replications” with somewhat different methodologies. This left them with “15 studies conducted with 1,746 participants from three different continents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is a graphic from the paper laying out Siev and his colleagues’ results. The bold vertical line represents the point of zero effect size (no relationship between unethical primes and cleansing preferences), with larger effect sizes to the right.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s perhaps most noteworthy here is that whereas the effect sizes found in the original three “Macbeth effect” studies were moderate-to-large, in all the 11 independent replication attempts&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;“there was no effect whatsoever”. In light of this, the authors argue, “the evidence suggests either that unethical primes do not generate a greater preference for cleansing-related stimuli than do ethical primes, or they generate a small one.” In other words it looks like the strength of the Macbeth Effect phenomenon has been overhyped, which won’t come as a surprise to those who have been following psychology’s replication crisis. (On the reverse question — of whether “cleansing alleviates moral threat” — the authors suggest there’s stronger evidence, in the form of several independent replications.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siev’s team dutifully point out that these failed replications shouldn’t be seen as the end of the story: A “Macbeth Effect may plausibly manifest within certain boundary conditions.” It could depend on the &lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt; of moral threat a study participant is faced with, for example, or the type of cleaning involved (say, a floor versus one’s hands).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the biggest lesson of this meta-analysis, though, has to do with science communications: It’s so often the case that when big, snazzy findings like the Macbeth Effect, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2016/09/power-poses-co-author-i-dont-think-power-poses-are-real.html&quot;&gt;power posing&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2017/01/psychologys-racism-measuring-tool-isnt-up-to-the-job.html&quot;&gt;implicit association test&lt;/a&gt; or any of a handful of other recent darlings of social psychology come down the pipeline, they’re quickly written up in university press releases and taken to be true by many consumers of popular science, as though they had been handed down on Biblical tablets. Yet subsequent attempts to replicate early, exciting effects have often either failed, or have uncovered something significantly less exciting. For everyone involved in this then — press officers, journalists and researchers themselves — just a bit more caution and humility is probably in order. In the meantime, it’s vital that researchers perform more replication attempts, and when practical, conduct these sorts of meta-analyses of replication attempts as well. It’s the only way to determine just how “real” snazzy ideas in psychology really are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Look. You can’t plan out your life. What you have to do is first discover your passion—what you really care about&lt;/em&gt;.” Barack Obama, as quoted by David Gergen (cited in &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/qj6y9&quot;&gt;Jachimowicz et al, 2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday, the first of two BPS career events took place – “perfect for anyone looking to discover where psychology can take them in their chosen career.” A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bps.org.uk/events/careers-psychology-london-2018&quot;&gt;second follows in London&lt;/a&gt; on Dec 4. If, like many, you are searching for your calling in life – perhaps you are still unsure whether psychology is for you, or which area of the profession aligns with what you most care about – here are five digested research findings worth taking into consideration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35259&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a difference between having a harmonious passion and an obsessive passion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you can find a career path or occupational goal that fires you up, you are more likely to succeed and find happiness through your work – that much we know from a deep research literature. But beware – since a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2003-08110-016&quot;&gt;seminal paper&lt;/a&gt; published in 2003 by the Canadian psychologist Robert Vallerand and his colleagues, researchers have made an important distinction between having a harmonious passion and an obsessive one. If you feel that your passion or calling is out of control, and that your mood and self-esteem depend on it, then this is the obsessive variety, and such passions, while they are energising, are also associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-015-9503-0&quot;&gt;negative outcomes&lt;/a&gt; like burnout and anxiety. In contrast, if your passion feels in control, reflects qualities that you like about yourself, and complements other important activities in your life, then this is the harmonious version, which is associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-015-9503-0&quot;&gt;positive outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, such as vitality, better work performance, experiencing flow, and positive mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having an unanswered calling in life is worse than having no calling at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you already have a burning ambition or purpose, do not leave it to languish. A few years ago, researchers at the University of South Florida &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/07/follow-your-heart-having-an-unanswered-calling-in-life-is-worse-than-having-no-calling-at-all/&quot;&gt;surveyed hundreds of people&lt;/a&gt; and grouped them according to whether they felt like they had no calling in life, that they had a calling they’d answered, or they had a calling but had never done anything about it. In terms of their work engagement, career commitment, life satisfaction, health and stress, the stand-out finding was that the participants who had a calling they hadn’t answered scored the worst across all these measures. The researchers said this puts a different spin on the presumed benefits of having a calling in life. They concluded: “having a calling is only a benefit if it is met, but can be a detriment when it is not as compared to having no calling at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without passion, grit is “merely a grind”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All this talk of finding a passion, but you may also have heard that “grit” is vital for career success. As advanced most famously by psychologist Angela Duckworth, this is the idea that highly successful, gritty people have impressive persistence: “To be gritty,” Duckworth writes in her landmark book on the subject, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://99u.adobe.com/articles/55219/true-grit-how-to-build-up-your-resilience&quot;&gt;is to fall down seven times, and rise eight&lt;/a&gt;.” It’s certainly true (many studies show) that being more conscientious – more self-disciplined and industrious – is associated with more career success. But is that all that being gritty means? Duckworth has always emphasised that it has another vital component that brings us back to passion again – alongside persistence, she says that gritty people also have an “ultimate concern” (another way of describing having a passion or calling). According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/115/40/9980&quot;&gt;a paper published earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, however, the standard measure of grit has failed to assess passion (or more specifically, “passion attainment”) – and Jon Jachimowicz and his colleagues believe this could explain why the research on grit has been so inconsistent (leading to claims that it is an overhyped concept and simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/09/25/the-in-vogue-psychological-construct-grit-is-an-example-of-redundant-labelling-in-personality-psychology-claims-new-paper/&quot;&gt;conscientiousness repackaged&lt;/a&gt;). Jachimowicz’s team found that when they explicitly measured passion attainment (how much people feel they have adequate passion for their work) and combined this with a measure of perseverance (a consistency of interests and the ability to overcome setbacks), then the two together &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; predict superior performance among tech company employees and university students. “Our findings suggest that perseverance without passion attainment is mere drudgery, but perseverance with passion attainment propels individuals forward,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest enough effort and you may find that your work becomes your passion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It’s all very well reading about the benefits of having a passion or calling in life, but if you haven’t got one, where to find it? &lt;a href=&quot;https://99u.adobe.com/articles/55219/true-grit-how-to-build-up-your-resilience&quot;&gt;Duckworth says that it’s a mistake to think that in a moment of revelation one will land in your lap&lt;/a&gt;, or simply occur to you through quiet contemplation – rather you need to explore different activities and pursuits, and expose yourself the different challenges and needs confronting society. If you still draw a blank, then perhaps it’s worth heeding the advice of others who say that it is not always the case that energy and determination flow from finding your passion – sometimes it can be the other way around, and if you put enough energy into your work, then passion will follow. Consider, for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/09/24/put-more-effort-into-a-project-and-youll-become-more-passionate-about-it/&quot;&gt;an eight-week repeated survey of German entrepreneurs&lt;/a&gt; published a few years ago that found a clear pattern – their passion for their ventures increased after they had invested more effort into the ventures the week before. A follow-up study qualified this, suggesting the energising effect of investing effort only arises when the project is freely chosen and there is a sense of progress. “Entrepreneurs increase their passion when they make significant progress in their venture and when they invest effort out of their own free choice,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you think passion comes from doing a job you enjoy, you’re likely to be disappointed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Another issue to consider is where &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think passion comes from. In a paper released as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/qj6y9&quot;&gt;preprint at PsyArXiv&lt;/a&gt;, Jon Jachimowicz and his team draw a distinction between people who believe that passion comes from doing what you enjoy (which they say is encapsulated by Oprah Winfrey’s commencement address in which she said passion “will bloom when we’re doing what we love”), and those who see it as arising from doing what you believe in or value in life (as reflected in the words of former Mexican President Felipe Calderón who in his own commencement address in 2011 said “you have to embrace with passion the things that you believe in, and that you are fighting for”). The researchers found that people believing that passion comes from pleasurable work were less likely to feel like they had found their passion (and were more likely to desire leaving their job) as compared with people who believe that passion comes from doing what you feel matters. Perhaps this is because there is a superficiality and ephemerality to working for sheer pleasure – what fits the bill one month or year may not do so for long – whereas working towards what you care about is a timeless endeavour that is likely to stretch and sustain you indefinitely. The researchers said their results showed: “the extent to which individuals attain their desired level of work passion may have less to do with their actual jobs and more to do with their beliefs about how work passion is pursued.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe psychology might be your calling, the British Psychological Society is holding two careers events &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bps.org.uk/events/careers-psychology-newcastle-2018&quot;&gt;this weekend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bps.org.uk/events/careers-psychology-london-2018&quot;&gt;next month&lt;/a&gt;. Both are open to members (at a discount) and non-members.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 &lt;h4&gt;Brains might compute, but not digitally.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*J3tX8SxApeRHo7HwNBv19A.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a good question: Is the brain a computer? One thing that makes this a good question is that it &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/how-to-find-out-if-your-brain-is-a-computer-644a1a4fed1b&quot;&gt;invites many further questions&lt;/a&gt;. Some people have taken the idea to be metaphorical: the brain is a computer in the same way that Juliet is the sun. That is just to say that it can be an illustrative way to think or talk about something, but not to be taken literally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, many do take it literally. My favorite example comes from the first sentence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/about/team/staff-profiles/christof-koch/&quot;&gt;Christoph Koch&lt;/a&gt;’s book, &lt;em&gt;Biophysics of Computation&lt;/em&gt;: “Brains compute!’’ So what does it mean if we take this idea literally, too? What &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; it mean?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what follows, I’ll briefly look at some previous ideas about how brains might compute, then explore the role of analog computation for making sense of neural computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Algorithms&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One idea, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/yes-the-brain-is-a-computer-11f630cad736&quot;&gt;explored in a previous blog post in this very forum&lt;/a&gt;, is that the brain is a computer because what it does can be described in terms of algorithms. Unfortunately, this view has some problems. One big one is that lots of things (maybe even everything) can be described algorithmically. If that’s true, then of course the brain is a computer, because everything is. But ideas that are trivially true aren’t very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s not enough that something is merely &lt;em&gt;describable&lt;/em&gt; by an algorithm for it to be a computer. Perhaps we can say that the brain computes because it &lt;em&gt;follows&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;runs&lt;/em&gt;, algorithms. Certainly not everything does that, even if everything is describable by an algorithm. Still, there is a problem with this idea. There’s a subtle, but important, distinction between being algorithmically describable and actually following an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example. Suppose I ask a child to write down a pattern of numbers, using the following rule. Start with 1, then add 3 to it and write that down, then add 5 to what you just wrote down, then add 7 to what you just wrote down, and so on. The child writes down 1, then 4, then 9, then 16, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, the child is following an algorithm — the “add 3, then 5, then 7, etc.” rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we can describe what the child is doing in terms of another algorithm: the child is producing the squares of consecutive integers. There are two different algorithms that produce the same pattern (in fact, there are infinitely many such algorithms). In this example, we know which algorithm the child is following out of the many algorithms that describe the behavior. But in other cases, we might not know at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it might not even make sense to think that the behavior of an organism is produced by following an algorithm at all, even if it is describable by some algorithm. For example, do single-celled organisms that move through increasing chemical gradients toward food really follow an algorithm? We know that computers can run algorithms depending on which program is running: these algorithms are stored and represented within the system. But for single-celled organisms, the “algorithm” is probably not represented anywhere: it’s just what the system does. But maybe it’s not a requirement that systems explicitly store and represent the algorithms they follow; however, that implies that objects falling due to gravity also follow algorithms! This does not seem like a happy result. These are all difficult and interesting questions, but for now, I will set them aside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A different problem with the idea of following algorithms is that what we usually mean by “algorithm” is entirely discrete. An algorithm consists of a finite series of discrete instructions, each of which takes some discrete amount of time. Turing’s work on the mathematical analysis of algorithms — and thus computation — assumes discrete time-steps and discrete variables (although, to be sure, “time’’ has to be understood abstractly as simply a succession of events, one after another, without particular units, such as milliseconds). Modern digital computers make the same assumptions. But we know that many elements of the brain are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; discrete: there are plenty of continuous quantities that seem to have an impact on what neurons do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s another problem. How we normally understand algorithms and computation is discrete through-and-through, but we know brains sometimes use continuous variables and processes. Even though we can &lt;em&gt;simulate&lt;/em&gt; continuous quantities digitally, that does not mean that continuous processes just &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; discrete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other problems, but rather than going through them all, I think it’s better to look at a different way forward. But to get there, we have to take a moment to think carefully about what &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11098-010-9562-8&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;analog&lt;/em&gt; really means, and what &lt;em&gt;discrete&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;digital&lt;/em&gt; mean&lt;/a&gt; — as well as how they can come apart. The upshot is that we can re-discover a way to think about computation that can be applied to computation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Analog Representation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking of the brain as an analog computer makes a lot of sense, but first we have to be clear about what exactly that means. Some have entertained this idea, but under the mistaken idea that “analog” is just synonymous with “continuous.” One thought along these lines is that, because continuous quantities can be simulated digitally, analog computation is not worth taking seriously. However, there is much more to analog computation, and for those of us who want to understand how (or even if) brains compute, we should try to understand different types of computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need to get a handle on analog representation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When most people think of what “analog’’ means, they think it just means continuous. In fact, the terms “analog’’ and “continuous’’ are often used interchangeably (although sometimes people also use “analog’’ to mean not-digital, or not on a computer, which is &lt;a href=&quot;http://bulletjournal.com&quot;&gt;too&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/10/editorial-keep-shopping-week-analog&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/a&gt;). However, a bit of reflection, plus a closer look at how analog computers actually operate, shows that this is not right. Instead, here’s the key idea:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analog representation is about &lt;em&gt;covariation&lt;/em&gt;, not continuity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with some examples of simple analog devices. A mercury thermometer is a good one (although mercury has largely been replaced by alcohol). What makes this kind of thermometer analog, rather than digital? The way it works is simple: the thermometer represents temperature, and as the temperature increases, so does the level of liquid in the thermometer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/270/1*0cvcV0i9pU-O67Ng0sdUKg.jpeg&quot; /&gt;An analog thermometer.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another example is the second hand of an analog clock. The way it works is also simple: the hand represents time, and as time increases, so does the angle of the second hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/384/1*mDuUVaoQua9Qi99ZIuWZqA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;An analog clock: as time increases, so do the angles of the hands.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both of these examples, the device represents something: temperature for the thermometer, and time for the watch. Also, in both of these examples, that representation is &lt;em&gt;analog&lt;/em&gt;. Why? Simply put, because there is an analogy between the representation and what it represents. Specifically, as the thing that’s being represented increases, the physical property that’s &lt;em&gt;doing the representing&lt;/em&gt; also increases. And by increase, I mean a &lt;em&gt;literal&lt;/em&gt; increase: an increase in the height of the liquid in the thermometer, and an increase in the angle of the second hand (with respect to 12, or straight up).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But angles and heights are continuous, right? I just said that continuity is not what being analog is all about. But think about that analog clock again. Some electric clocks have second hands that sweep continuously, but many analog clocks (such as wristwatches) tick: the second hand moves in discrete steps. Does ticking (i.e. moving in discrete steps) mean an analog watch isn’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; analog anymore? Of course not! An analog representation can be continuous &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; discrete, as long as the right kind of physical covariation is in place. When you start looking for them, you can see many more examples, too. Hourglasses, for example, are analog representations of how much time has passed, whether they contain a liquid, really small particles that you just take to be continuous, or big, discrete things like marbles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now this is all just a matter of thinking about the concept of “analog,” and looking at some examples of analog representation. But it also turns out that this is how to understand analog computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Analog (vs. Digital) Computation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t familiar with analog computation, you’re not alone. It was once the dominant computing paradigm, but digital computers have almost completely replaced analog computers. With advances in engineering, digital computers eventually became faster, more flexible, and cheaper than their analog counterparts. Nevertheless, they’re fascinating, and not just as a historical curiosity. They also exemplify a completely different kind of computation that — although not practical from an engineering perspective — shows another way that brains might compute. So let’s take a brief look at how they work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/949/1*qFmpB6hmsyw1ozo6hOH7kA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.analogmuseum.org/library/telefunken_ra770_kurzbeschreibung.pdf&quot;&gt;Engineer operating the Telefunken 770 RA analog computer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key idea of analog computers is that they represent variables by the actual voltage level of a circuit element. So if you have a variable with the value 72.3, the circuit element representing that variable would be at 72.3 volts. This is completely different than how such a value would be stored in a digital computer: in that case, 72.3 would be represented by a series of 1s and 0s in some register (or, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754&quot;&gt;IEEE 754 standard for floating-point numbers,&lt;/a&gt; 01000010100100001001100110011010).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To add two variables in an analog computer, you use a circuit that literally adds the voltages: a circuit element would take two inputs, one that has &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; volts, one that has &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; volts, and produce an output that has (&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;+&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;) volts. But in a digital computer, to add two variables you use circuitry that adds the two numbers digit-by-digit, much the way that we all learned how to add numbers in elementary school. The least significant digits are added first, then the next most significant (plus a carry digit from the previous addition, if needed), and so on, until we reach the end of the digits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the variables in analog computers are continuous, but there are exceptions, and those exceptions are important. Often, when using an analog computer, it helps to know how to program it using a mathematical characterization of whatever you’re interested in. But there are times when you might not know how to characterize something mathematically: you just know what it looks like. So instead of using a continuous function like a sine wave or polynomial, analog computers could approximate complex curves with a series of straight line segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*PK-qIF4ZrFQoGoCZyKi76Q.png&quot; /&gt;A continuous function (gray) approximated by a series of line segments (black).&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other times, they would use step functions, with gaps between one value and another, where the voltage would literally switch between the values. Did the existence of these discontinuities mean that these computers weren’t really analog? Not at all: just like analog clocks that tick, analog computers with “steps” are still analog. And again, the reason is that there is analogy between &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; they represent and &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they represent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is worth belaboring a bit, especially in contrast with digital representation. Somewhat paradoxically, digital representation is both much more complicated but also much more familiar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take two digital representations of two different numbers. To keep things simple, we’ll use base-10, which we’re all familiar with, instead of the binary, or base-2 representation used in digital computers. The point is the same in either case. Compare how we represent the number three hundred forty seven and the number seven hundred twelve. Digitally, we represent the first number as 347, and the second as 712. What do those strings of numerals mean? Again, we are so familiar with this that we rarely stop to think about it, but we interpret them as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;347&lt;br /&gt; = (3 × 10²)+(4 ×10¹)+(7 × 10⁰)&lt;br /&gt; = (3 × 100)+(4 ×10)+(7 × 1)&lt;br /&gt; = 300 + 40 + 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;712&lt;br /&gt; = (7 × 10²)+(1 ×10¹)+(2 ×10⁰)&lt;br /&gt; = (7 × 100)+(1 ×10)+(2 × 1)&lt;br /&gt; = 700 + 10 + 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An important thing to note is that when we compare the two &lt;em&gt;representations&lt;/em&gt;, neither one is larger than the other. Of course, seven hundred twelve is a larger number than three hundred forty seven. But the three character string “712” is not itself larger than the three character string “347” (as long as we hold the font fixed!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things are different when it comes to analog representations. If we represent these two numbers in an analog computer, for example, one voltage (712 volts) is literally larger than the other (347 volts). Or in the case of the analog thermometer, the height of the liquid representing 80 degrees is literally taller than the height representing 60 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, all of this still holds whether or not voltages and heights can only come in discrete pieces; analog representation just doesn’t have anything to do with continuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before continuing, let me mention another point about what digital does not mean. Some people take “digital” to be synonymous with “discrete,” but the two are different. Digital representations are, well, representations of digits, just like the example we just went through. “Discrete,” however, is much more general, and just means that the thing in question has separate parts. For many purposes, it may not be important that we’re careful about the distinction, but when we’re talking about computation, either in the brain or elsewhere, it is very important. Why? Simply because digital computers use the fact that numbers are represented digitally in order to function as they do. They are not called digital computers simply because they use discrete elements, or operate in discrete steps, but because they represent numbers (including variables, memory addresses, instructions, and so on) in base-2, digital format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, different kinds of tasks are better served by different kinds of computers using different kinds of representations. As it happened, digital computers got fast enough and cheap enough that they were preferred over their analog counterparts, although that wasn’t always true. But let’s look at just one simplified example to show the difference between a digital and an analog computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/1*nIjx6j6bH5I1K3YiRespUw.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose I give you one thousand numbers that are represented digitally. More specifically, suppose I give you a thousand index cards, each one of which has a single number written on it. Your task is to find the largest number in that stack of a thousand. The fastest way to do this is also the simplest: you take the first card, call it the largest-so-far, then compare it with the next card. If that card is larger, you have a new largest-so-far; if not, you don’t. You keep comparing, and after 1,000 steps, you will have found the largest card in the pile. In general, how many steps does it take? It takes as many steps as cards you have. In computational complexity theory, we would say that this task has linear time complexity: start with 2,000 cards, it will take you twice as long; 3,000 cards, three times as long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/1*rgaC7co6_DDq3s2iPSyXgw.png&quot; /&gt;Spaghetti noodles. © Can Stock Photo / AlfaStudio&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, suppose that instead of giving you a thousand numbers represented digitally, I gave you a thousand analog representations of numbers. In particular, suppose that I give you a bundle of one thousand spaghetti noodles, where the length of each noodle (in, say, millimeters) is the number being represented. Your task (again) is to find the largest number in those thousand. The fastest way to do this (again) is also the simplest: you take the bundle of noodles, tap one end on a flat surface, like a table, and place your hand down so that it hits the tallest one. After a single step, you will have found the largest noodle in the bundle, which represents the largest number of the thousand. In general, this only takes &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; step, which is constant time complexity (much better than linear!). No matter how many numbers (or, rather, representations of numbers) you start with, it’s always just one step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This example illustrates one way that analog representation can be more efficient, but it also illustrates one of its limitations. Say we had many numbers that were very close in value to one another; it may be difficult to pick out the tallest one if they only differ by fractions of a millimeter. Represented digitally, however, we can easily tell whether two numbers are different. When it comes to contemporary digital computers, where individual steps can be taken at the rate of billions per second, this increased precision outweighs the larger number of steps needed (this, among others reasons, is why analog computers have fallen out of favor for general use).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Analog Computation in General…&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, I hope to have made clear what analog representation is, and given at least a flavor of how analog computation works. Next, I need to say more about analog computation in general. Luckily for us though, understanding analog &lt;em&gt;representation&lt;/em&gt; is the hard part. All we need to add to the story to get analog computation is a mechanism that manipulates analog representations. But not just any old mechanism will do, nor will just any old manipulation. We need to be more specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/814/1*ubrnz-_kfI0aFwLrRKEzyg.png&quot; /&gt;Schematic diagram of a mechanism: organized entities and their activities (bottom) are responsible for a phenomenon of interest (top).&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philosophers of science have developed an account of mechanisms that makes precise what scientists, especially neuroscientists, implicitly mean when they talk about mechanisms (a book-length account is given in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.wustl.edu/cfcraver&quot;&gt;Carl Craver&lt;/a&gt;’s book Explaining the Brain). We don’t need to get into the details, but the general idea is straightforward: a mechanism is a set of entities and activities, organized in a particular way, that give rise to a phenomenon of interest. For much of neuroscience, what it means to explain some phenomenon is to discover and describe the mechanism responsible for that phenomenon. This is in contrast to, say, physics, where explanation involves describing a universal law of nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if we have a mechanism that manipulates analog representations, do we have an analog computer? Not quite. The manipulation has to be of the right kind. For example, I could build a device that rotates an analog thermometer (like the thermometer mentioned above). That’s certainly a kind of manipulation, and the device that does the rotating may well be a mechanism. But it’s not the right kind of manipulation. So what is the right kind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the mechanism has to manipulate the part of the analog representation that is doing the representing. So when we want to represent a temperature, we have to manipulate the &lt;em&gt;height&lt;/em&gt; of the liquid in the thermometer, not its angle. This, by the way, is precisely how thermostats work: one part of the device represents the actual temperature, another part of the device represents the desired temperature. And for analog thermostats, this is done with analog representations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we move on to see what this has to do with brains, let me point out that a nice thing about the story I just told is that it generalizes pretty well to digital computers, too. Just replace “analog” in what I said above with “digital:” a digital computer is a mechanism that manipulates digital representations, and it also has to manipulate them in the right way. Heating up the circuitry on your laptop is definitely a way to manipulate the digital representations inside, but not in a way that constitutes computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;…And in the Brain&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, now that we know what analog computation is, what does this have to do with brains? Quite a lot!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, a general point. Couching computation in terms of representation helps us distinguish what’s computational about the brain, and what isn’t. Brains, like all organs, do all kinds of things that aren’t directly relevant to their primary function, but simply help keep them alive. So for example, we once thought that glial cells only held neurons together and didn’t contribute anything interesting to neural signaling (hence their name, derived from the Greek word for glue). We now know that at least one type of glial cell, the astrocytes, &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; contribute to signaling between neurons; another type, the ependymal cells, do not. That means that astrocytes — but not ependymal cells — contribute to computation in the brain. Neural signals are representations (or parts of representations), and the manipulation of those representations (by the right kind of mechanism) is computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let’s talk more specifically about what the &lt;em&gt;analog&lt;/em&gt; part of this story about computation has to do with brains. There is a whole lot of neural activity that counts as analog representation; you just have to remember that analog representation is about covariation (as discussed above), and not necessarily about continuity. So let’s look at some examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href=&quot;https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/ratecoding&quot;&gt;consider rate coding&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most well-studied ideas of neural representation, and also one of the earliest. The basic idea of rate coding is simply that as a stimulus intensity increases (or decreases), the firing rate of the relevant neuron increases (or decreases). In other words, the representation (firing rate) increases with the thing being represented (the stimulus). That is about as straightforward an example of an analog representation as one could want. Whether it then counts as analog computation depends on whether the system in question manipulates that representation. For example, in their seminal 1926 work, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1514868/&quot;&gt;Adrian and Zotterman&lt;/a&gt; found that as they increased the weight attached to muscle tissue, the sensory neurons of that muscle tissue increased their firing rate. The firing of those neurons serve as input to downstream neurons, and we have an analog computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, rate coding has its limitations, but we can apply the model of analog computation to other neural coding schemes, too. For example, consider timing codes. Some timing codes in the auditory system, for example, work by comparing the relative time that different neural signals arrive at the same place. This allows the organism to locate where a sound came from. The larger the distance between the arrival of two signals, the larger the angle of the sound’s location from the center. Once again, an analog representation, used by the system, resulting in an analog computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more complicated example is how grid cells work. These are groups of neurons that create a two-dimensional map of a two-dimensional environment. So, for example, as the organism moves right, the activity of the grid cells “moves” right; as the organism moves left, the activity “moves” left. (More precisely, neurons representing locations to the left of the current position will fire as the organism moves left, vice versa for the right.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/375/1*2YtgtjV9pZMS_jE2wif0oA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Grid cells firing in response to an organism’s movement.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an example of a two-dimensional analog representation, rather than the one-dimensional examples from above. Instead of changing just up or down, increasing or decreasing, we have change along two spatial dimensions. And the change in what’s represented (the environment) results in a corresponding change in the representation (the grid cells).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another, higher-level, example is mental rotation in humans, which relies on the manipulation of analog representation (which, if you buy the view I propose here, just &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; analog computation). Here is the task used in the relevant studies, originally devised by Shepard and Metzler in 1971. A participant is shown two pictures of 3-D objects, and asked to push one button (“same”) if the one on the right is a rotated version of the one on the left, and a different button (“different”) if the one on the right is a different object. An example is in the figure below: the top two figures are “same,” but the bottom two are “different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*CCOh0tEHauufqba2nLkmoQ.png&quot; /&gt;Mental rotation stimuli. Top two objects are “same,” while the bottom two are “different.”&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when you record the time it takes for people to make a response (we only care about the “same” ones), you find that the more the objects are rotated, the longer it takes people to make that response. It’s as if people are mentally “rotating” the object in their head, and checking to see if the objects match. So, the more the objects are rotated, the more mental rotation they have to do, which translates into a longer response time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding has been replicated in numerous studies; in recent decades, cognitive neuroscientists have produced fMRI data from people performing the task while having their brain scanned. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17919082&quot;&gt;meta-analysis from 2008&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dcl.wustl.edu/people/jzacks/&quot;&gt;Jeff Zacks&lt;/a&gt; found that dozens of these studies support the view that mental rotation depends on analog representations, supporting the original hypothesis proposed by Shepard and Metzler. Why should we think this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One important point is that there are much more efficient ways to rotate the representation of an object. Using a typical digital representation, such as what is used in computer graphics systems, involves linear algebra. Without going into the details, the idea is that we can — in one step — multiply the 3-D coordinates of an object by a matrix, resulting in the object being rotated. Importantly, the amount of time it takes to rotate an object by two degrees is the same amount of time it takes to rotate an object by 180 degrees. However, that is simply not the result we find when humans perform this task. Instead, longer rotations take more time. That suggests that we are not rotating the object in a single step, but manipulating an analog representation that covaries with what it represents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analogy helps. Think about adding a couple of two-digit numbers the way you learned in elementary school. To keep things simple, we’ll use numbers that don’t require any carry digits. So if we want to add 11 to 12, we put one on top of the other, and add the digits. Same thing if we want to add 66 and 33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/450/1*sF6FWsVFG-05n1AtUCy0Og.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each case, it takes the same number of steps, even though in the left problem, we’re starting and ending with much smaller numbers. This is just a fact about doing the addition digitally: even though the numbers are bigger, we’re just manipulating digits, and we’ve got the same number of digits in each case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let’s say we had to do the addition in a way that you learned when you were even younger, using (although you didn’t know it at the time) analog representations. Suppose we had a big bag of marbles, and we did the problem on the left by taking out 11 marbles, one at a time, then adding 12 marbles to those, one at a time, and then counting how many marbles we end up with. That would obviously take much less time than doing the problem on the right the same way. Now granted, this is not an efficient way of doing addition! But it does illustrate how analog — but not digital — representations take longer time to do some computations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, some might think that this is all well and good, but at the very lowest levels, neural spikes are like the bits of digital computers; so maybe this analog stuff doesn’t have much to do with the hardware of the brain. Neural spikes are either on or off, just like the 1s and 0s of digital computers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann&quot;&gt;John von Neumann&lt;/a&gt;, one of the founders of the digital computer and a prolific polymath, put the view like this in &lt;a href=&quot;https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300181111/computer-and-brain&quot;&gt;his 1957 lecture&lt;/a&gt;: “The nervous pulses can clearly be viewed as (two-valued) markers: the absence of a pulse then represents one value (say, the binary digit 0), and the presence of one represents the other (say, the binary digit 1). This is clearly the description of the functioning of an organ in a digital machine. It therefore justifies the original assertion, that the nervous system has a prima facie digital character.” So maybe there are some analog things happening at higher levels, but at its root, neural spikes are discrete and digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some new evidence suggests that this might not be the whole story. An intriguing set of examples from scientists including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25394682&quot;&gt;Bialowas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25461842&quot;&gt;Rama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28228266&quot;&gt;Rowan&lt;/a&gt;, and several others shows that there may be more to action potentials than previously thought. So first, let’s review a bit about action potentials, then see what these new results suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traditional view of the action potential is that it is a lot like the binary pulse of a digital computer. If we look close at the 1s and 0s of a digital computer, we’ll see that they are actually continuously-changing voltages. However, that continuous change stays around either (for example) zero volts or five volts, and the minor fluctuations above and below those two levels don’t matter for digital systems. That’s because we have designed them that way: even though there is continuous fluctuation, we can treat those voltages as if they are really at two discrete levels, which we call 0 and 1. The slight difference in the waveform from one bit to another doesn’t matter: all that matters is that there is some voltage that’s pretty close to 5 volts or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*XTIKoPJdiGAqiXF45gWiww.png&quot; /&gt;The digital computer and the neuron. Top: actual transistor voltage is “translated” as a 1. Bottom: actual neuron voltage is “translated” as a 1.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how neuroscientists have traditionally viewed the action potential, too. If we compare two different action potentials, there might be a slight difference in the waveform, but that doesn’t matter for the system. All that matters is whether there’s an action potential or not. Now, to be sure, there are exceptions: some neurons don’t generate spikes at all, but have a signal that varies continuously — neurons connected by gap junctions are an important example. And for other neurons, it’s not really the single spike that matters, but their rate of firing, as mentioned above. But these new findings are different altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of having no significance, the scientists mentioned above have shown that the precise shape of the neural spike does have consequences. What does that mean? Basically, if a neural spike is a bit taller (it has a higher voltage), then it has a measurable effect on what happens to the neurons it’s connected to. Or, if the spike is a bit wider (it takes a little bit longer), then it also has a measurable effect on downstream neurons. These effects are small, but they are measurable, and completely different than what we find in digital computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So do these count as analog representations? Well, we don’t know yet. They are candidates, because we have something (a neural spike) that varies in the right way. But we do not yet know if these are representations at all. As mentioned before, neurons can do a lot of things, not all of which contribute to their representational capacities. If it turns out that the height (or width) of the neural spike increases as some other variable increases, it may well be a representation. We will have to see. For now though, it is an interesting candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, let me mention one aspect of analog computation that really has no counterpart in digital computation, which is also, admittedly, the most speculative on my part. Imagine you have a small computer program, or perhaps even a spreadsheet, where you have some variable called, say, “GrandTotal.” It’s easy enough to program a computer (or create a spreadsheet) that adds a whole bunch of numbers together, and stores that result in GrandTotal. And somewhere, deep in the electronic bowels of your computer’s processor, there are some circuits called registers, and there’s a single register that physically stores the value of GrantTotal. Your computer is doing a lot of other things, so there are a lot of other values stored in nearby registers, too. Suppose, in fact, that, just for fun, you wanted to add the values of the eight nearest neighbors — the other registers nearest to GrandTotal — and store those in GrandTotal, too. How can you do this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you can’t. The way digital machines are designed and built, their physical implementation is completely abstracted from their programming. There is no way to access variables that are literally, physically closest to the one you are working with. Of course, if you are very familiar with a particular computer, you might be able to discover which of those registers are closest. But then they will be completely different in another machine. There is simply no way to put this kind of capability into the general programming of a digital computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, however, neurons do things like this all the time. Some neural signals, such as neuromodulators, are often simply broadcast to whatever neurons happen to be nearby. This capability takes advantage of the fact that neurons are physical devices, located in space relative to one another. And although digital computation can’t provide this kind of capability, certain kinds of analog computation can. This is simply because &lt;em&gt;analog computation embraces the physical nature of its representations, whereas digital computation abstracts away from it&lt;/em&gt;. Now to be sure, digital computation has many advantages: it is quite nice to be able to use the same program on a wide variety of different computers from different manufacturers, with different speeds, different amounts of memory, and so on. But there is more to computation than just the digital, which, if I’ve done my job, you’ll believe now, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analog computers have fallen out of favor, and as a consequence, we don’t think about them when we think about computation. And while the advantages of digital computation are clear for practical purposes, analog computation turns out to be an excellent way to think of computation more generally. When we look closely at how digital computation really works, it has almost nothing in common with how brains work. If digital computation is the only concept of computation you have, you might think we should abandon the idea that brains literally compute. But that would be much too hasty: we just need a broader notion of computation, and it turns out that looking to analog computation helps us see how brains could be computers after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want more?

&lt;p&gt;Every child is born into a world far more complex than the womb it departed. Physically it’s made up of objects, distances, heights, which we know new-born infants are already oriented to read and make sense of. But their new world is also a social one, chock-full of agents with needs and intentions, and past findings show that infants are surprisingly quick to recognise much of this too.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;New research &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/115/38/E8835&quot;&gt;in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; adds to this literature, investigating the ability to make an important social distinction – between those who hold power due to respect and those who impose it through force – and finds that already by the time they are toddlers, infants can do this too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35161&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past evidence showed that infants in the first year of life can view situations and recognise who is likely to hold power. They are more surprised (we know this because they pay attention for longer) when a smaller figure bosses a bigger one about, or a lone figure controls someone with companions, than when the opposite is true. Infants also seem to grasp that power lasts over time, looking longer when someone who used to be obeyed is suddenly defied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A research team led by Francesco Margoni of the University of Trento, wanted to see if this sensitivity to power extended to telling between its two major types –  legitimate power (e.g. when someone is chosen to be leader or has natural talents) and power based on bullying and inciting fear. We know that these types of power have different implications: fear-based power is resented and can lead to acts of disobedience when possible. Do infants have a sense of this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out, Margoni’s team recruited 96 healthy infants – average age 20-24 months; a balance of sexes – and presented them with a series of cartoony videos (see examples below). One set began with three figures playing with a ball who are visited by a leader wearing a flamboyant hat and wielding a stick that it used to strike the floor, triggering a greeting ritual involving the ball-players&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;bowing and murmuring reverently (intended to show this leader was respected).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the leader told the other characters it was time for bed, led them into a house, and left. At this point the study forked, and the infants either saw the subordinates closing their eyes, thus obeying the leader, or they watched a different clip where the ball-playing characters exited the house back to their game area. These two 15-second climaxes looped until the infant lost interest. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, the infants looked significantly longer at the version of the story involving disobedience, suggesting that already at this age, the infants did not expect a respected leader to be disobeyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other infants viewed a similar series of videos with a crucial difference: the cue for where the visiting leader was drawing their power. Instead of using their stick for a greeting ritual, this bully visitor used it to strike each of the other characters on the head. Margoni’s team were interested in what the infants would make of disobedience towards this kind of bullying leader. In fact the infants’ looking times were similar whether the subordinate characters did as they were told or disobeyed, suggesting they did not find disobeying a bully at all surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow-up experiments showed the main findings were unaffected by whether or not the leader wore a giant hat (implying that the size of the leader figure wasn’t the determining factor). Nor were the effects due to the bully being seen as ineffectual: when another video showed the bully staying in the room, infants now found disobedience surprising. Even though the bully was outnumbered, the infants still expected what the bully said to be law… at least for those within reach of the stick.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last possibility was that the infants expected compliance to the leader figure because they seemed nice, not because they seemed powerful. So the researchers introduced a visitor who was friendly but had no obvious power. Now the infants were more surprised when the ball-playing characters &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; obey, quite the opposite effect to that found with the respected leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research suggests that we understand power relations at a surprisingly young age. The infant mind can read legitimate power and distinguish it from tyranny, understanding not merely who is in charge, but why. Even toddlers recognise that the iron fist holds the most tenuous grip on power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/115/38/E8835&quot;&gt;Infants distinguish between leaders and bullies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious to know why the electro-diffusion equation is called the Nernst-Planck equation, I read the original papers by these authors a few years ago. This reading formed the basis of a little review paper of mine with the above title (published in Journal of Integrative Neuroscience 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review first discussed Nernst's and Planck's early papers on electro-diffusion, the brief priority conflict that followed, and the role these papers played in shaping the  emerging concept of membrane excitability. The second part of this review discussed in greater detail the constraints of the Nernst-Planck theory, and showed more recent examples of its applicability to neuronal modelling.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;div class=&quot;elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that up to 50% of R&amp;amp;D budgets may be dedicated to outsourced projects by 2020, there was high interest in this invite-only session. The 60-minute panel discussion was followed by a closed networking reception, permitting a private space for open discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;Panelists and audience members discussed how adopting an RDM technology platform has helped organizations achieve better returns on R&amp;amp;D investments. With the technology, companies are able to quickly find global service providers, allowing for early collaboration, improved contract management, and compliance transparency. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 I obtained from the EU commission evidence that Smits was at least strongly influenced by Frontiers while designing Plan S. There were meetings with Kamila Markram and other Frontiers representatives, most notably on 25 April 2018, and a string of emails, where Smits requested and received &quot;Frontiers feedback on the transition to OA and APCs&quot;. Smits recently accepted the invitation as speaker next to Kamila, at a Frontiers-organised conference on 29 November 2018 in Brussels.</content>

&lt;p&gt;There are various issues on which there is a scientific consensus but great public controversy, such as anthropogenic climate change and the safety of vaccines. One previously popular explanation for this mismatch was that an information deficit among the public is to blame. Give people all the facts and then, according to this perspective, the public will catch up with the scientists. Yet time and again, that simply hasn’t happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13546783.2018.1521870&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Thinking and Reasoning&lt;/em&gt; explores the roots of this problem further. Emilio Lobato and Corinne Zimmerman asked 244 American university students and staff whether they agreed with the scientific consensus on climate change, vaccines, genetically modified (GMO) foods and evolution; to give their reasons; and to say what would convince them to change their position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past research has already done a good job of identifying the individual characteristics – such as having an analytical thinking style and being non-religious – that tend to correlate with accepting the scientific consensus, but this is the first time that researchers have systematically studied people’s open-ended reasoning about controversial scientific topics. The results show that for many people, there are certain issues for which the truth is less about facts and more about faith and identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-35193&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lobato and Zimmerman found that the most common justifications people gave for their positions on the controversial issues were to simply re-state or qualify their belief – what the researchers called a non-justification, which made up 34 per cent of all responses. Among the actual justifications, the most common kind, making up 33 per cent of all responses, was to cite evidence – a promising result. However, 20 per cent of justifications were subjective and involved making a reference to one’s cultural identity, personal experience or fallacious reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific kinds of subjective justification given tended to vary according to topic. For instance, sceptical attitudes toward the scientific consensus on genetically modified foods (as safe) tended to involve fallacious reasoning of a conspiratorial bent (such as “I am hesitant to believe there are NO concerns because the multinational agricultural corporations such as Monsanto have profits as the basis of their existence so any information they put out is suspect”), or they invoked the naturalistic fallacy (such as, “GMO foods are unnatural and therefore not safe for our bodies”). In contrast, subjective justifications for disbelieving evolutionary theory were more likely to make reference to the importance of one’s cultural or religious identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the most significant finding, though, was people’s inconsistency in how they reasoned about the four different scientific topics. For example, while many participants did cite data and evidence to justify their stance on some occasions, only 27 participants (11 per cent) did this consistently across all the topics. “It seems that people are consistently inconsistent in how they reason about scientific topics,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a similar story when it came to the kind of reasons that participants cited that would cause them to change their minds. While it was promising that new evidence or data was mentioned more often than any other reasons, still 45 per cent of participants explicitly denied, at least once, that anything could change their mind on a particular topic; 17 per cent said this of more than one topic. And while 80 per cent of participants indicated that new evidence or data would change their mind on a particular topic, not a single participant took this position on all four controversial topics. Again, the main message is people’s inconsistency in how they reason about different scientific topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirming prior research on individual characteristics that correlate with scientific reasoning, participants with more of an analytical reasoning style (as measured by agreement with questionnaire items like “I enjoy problems that require hard thinking”) and a stronger liberal political orientation, were more likely to agree with the scientific consensus on the four topics, and to make reference to evidence when reasoning about their position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lobato and Zimmerman cautioned that it remains to be seen whether their findings would generalise to scientific topics that have not (yet) been politicised. Of course the current results are also based on a narrow US sample and may be different elsewhere. Notwithstanding these limitations, the researchers said their findings could have implications for scientific advocates: they suggest it may be beneficial to discuss and present topics in a way that reduces any association with your audience’s socio-political identity; and they highlight the importance of better training and education in an analytical thinking style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Being able to tailor education about science to the manner in which people think about science may improve scientific literacy,” the researchers concluded, “but doing so requires more research into why people hold the beliefs they do about science.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/BMCWordle-620x342-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Neuroscience:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12868-018-0462-8&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effect of pulsed transcranial ultrasound stimulation at different number of tone-burst on cortico-muscular coupling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulation can be defined as “the alteration of nerve activity through targeted delivery of a stimulus, such as electrical stimulation or chemical agents, to specific neurological sites in the body.” A growing area of research in the field of neuromodulation has been centered around its potential effects on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_cortex&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;motor cortex&lt;/a&gt;. Successful neuromodulation of the motor cortex could promise life-changing implications for those affected by movement disorders brought on by stroke and diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this research highlight the potential of neuromodulation, and pTUS specifically, as a potential future treatment for motor dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A promising neuromodulation technique shown to affect the motor cortex is pulse transcranial ultrasound stimulation (pTUS). This method uses pulsed low-frequency ultrasound to harmlessly penetrate deep into brain tissue and can be targeted specifically towards brain waves which affect muscle activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, researchers published a study in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which looked at the effect pTUS had on the cortico-muscular coupling (mind-muscle connection) between the motor cortex and tail muscles in mouse subjects. Researchers, Xie &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; tested different tone bursts and evaluated the effect they had on the muscle activity of the mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xie and colleagues found that significant differences in the cortico-muscular coupling activity of mice resulted from an increasing number of tone-bursts, from 150 – 300, at 1kHZ. The results of this research highlight the potential of neuromodulation, and pTUS specifically, as a potential future treatment for motor dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pediatrics:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-018-1300-y&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Procedural pain in children: a qualitative study of caregiver experiences and information needs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatric medical patients are often not as resilient to the pain associated with common invasive medical procedures, such as venipuncture, when compared to their adult counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers, Shave &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, published this study in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where they took a qualitative, interview-based approach at assessing child caregivers’ understanding and perspective towards pain associated with pediatric medical procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10642&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10642&quot; height=&quot;193&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/paed-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;290&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the survey saw that caregivers were generally satisfied with the pain management practices that healthcare providers afforded their pediatric patients. However, study participants showed further emphasis toward the value of providing extra information to caregivers and pediatric patients, regarding the purpose of the procedures, as well as what to expect in terms of pain or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Lastly, participating caregivers further suggested that healthcare providers should direct extra effort towards addressing the child specifically, informing them of the sensations and outcomes of the procedure in terms they can understand; as well as allowing the pediatric patients to ask questions and make decisions regarding the procedure whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Mechanical Engineering: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmecheng.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The BMC Series’ newest journal for the physical sciences, Mechanical Engineering, is now open to submissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10643&quot; style=&quot;width: 251px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10643 &quot; height=&quot;363&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/engineer-199x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;241&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the BMC Series announced that it would be expanding its journal portfolio beyond the realm of biology and medicine, and into the physical sciences. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmecheng.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Mechanical Engineering &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;is the fourth and latest of these journals to be open for submission. The journal’s scope ranges from articles on “fluid dynamics” to “mechatronics and automation” and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexandros Houssein, Ph.D., Editor for &lt;em&gt;BMC Mechanical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, recently published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2018/10/26/bmc-mechanical-engineering-now-open-submissions&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; announcing the journal’s launch and detailing the importance of the new open access platform now available to the mechanical engineering research community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Houssein speaks on behalf of the journal’s ethos by stating, “&lt;em&gt;BMC Mechanical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; embraces this diversity of subjects and comes to support a large and international research community. With a focus on championing open access research, it aims to advance scientific discovery by making research freely accessible across the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The storage of digital information in DNA has recently gained a lot of attention due to its promise of high-volume, and extremely long-term, storage potential. While DNA digital data storage is currently possible and being utilized, improvements to methodologies are necessary to realize the full potential of this fascinating and efficient storage model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers, Akhmetov &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, have recently published an article in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Biotechnology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where they detail their development of a novel DNA digital data storage method. Their “parallelized” storage method aims to capitalize on the weaknesses of previously established methodologies, allowing for better long-term storage, built-in error detection, increased efficiency, and a redundant reading process that allows for the collection of data even if the DNA is damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of better DNA digital storage methodologies will be fascinating developments to witness as we make it feasible to store immense datasets for longer terms than previously thought possible, all using the building blocks of life itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just prior to the 2018 annual meeting for the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the chair of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcchemeng.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Sang Yup Lee, participated in an interview where the importance of scientific publishing was discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lee began by discussing how, over the years, the field of Chemical Engineering has been constantly adapting its principles and practices to remain useful, and in some cases essential, to various scientific disciplines. Dr. Lee even asserted, “Chemical engineering has been, is and will be at the core of all industries, including energy, chemicals, materials, medicine, agriculture, and environmental sustainability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Peer-reviewed work published in high-quality journals advances science and engineering, particularly when the research is published open access”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this information being generated by chemical engineers across such a wide field of disciplines, Dr. Lee went on to emphasize the importance of publication and the open access model: “Publishing in scientific journals is one of the most important media for the dissemination of research outputs. Peer-reviewed work published in high-quality journals advances science and engineering, particularly when the research is published open access.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-5995-3&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigating the growing trend of non-drinking among young people; analysis of repeated cross-sectional surveys in England 2005–2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;England’s youth have been experiencing an increasing trend in alcohol abstention, which has been wholly celebrated from a public health standpoint. Among citizens aged 16 to 24, the rate of self-reported “non-drinkers” has risen from 18% in 2005 to 29% in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10645&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10645&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/non-drinking-300x300.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An article recently published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aimed to look at the ways in which non-drinking behavior has been increasing among the young adult population in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study evaluated whether specific subgroups have been experiencing a disproportionate increase in non-drinking, as well as whether rates of problematic drinking behaviors, such as binge drinking, are changing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers Fat &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, utilized a qualitative, survey-based approach, where trained interviewers administered a face-to-face interview inside participants’ homes. The study revealed that rates of non-drinking are on the rise across most of its practices, the only exception being that of ex-drinkers, which saw neither an increase or decrease in prevalence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the study also showed that, overall, non-drinking behavior is increasing across many subgroups, including subgroups that are already associated with non-drinking behavior. Young adults are also engaging in problematic drinking behaviors less, as rates of overdrinking and binge drinking are lower than previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study also found no significant association between non-drinking and any one single factor in particular, suggesting that the change may be “multi-factorial or cultural.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homeless individuals lack many things considered essential, appropriate health care should not be one of them. In the year 2000, the United Nations stated: “Health is a fundamental human right indispensable for the exercise of other human rights. Every human being is entitled to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health conducive to living a life in dignity.” Despite this policy, it has been shown that the homeless population is still not afforded an appropriate level of care, especially for end of life palliative care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10654&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10654 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/homeless-2-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors of an article recently published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpalliatcare.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Palliative Care&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; detail their findings from their study on the quality of palliative care provided to the homeless population in the Netherlands. De Veer &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; conducted quality in-depth interviews with over 50 participants, including homeless individuals, nurses, case workers, and physicians. The interviews were used to reconstruct the cases of 19 homeless individuals who are or have previously experienced palliative care, 11 of which had already passed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the non-homeless population, homeless individuals were found to experience several key themes that prevented them from experiencing adequate palliative care, namely: late access to palliative care, capricious health care trajectories, and a high degree of complexity associated with care.&lt;/p&gt;
