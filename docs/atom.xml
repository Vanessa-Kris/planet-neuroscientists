 &lt;p&gt;The climate crisis is a defining challenge of the 21st century. If we keep on the same emissions path, we expect a sea rise of 2 meters, hundreds of millions of climate refugees, a mass extinction of over half of animal species, and decreases agricultural productivity that could leave a billion people starving by 2100. The IPCC report shows 4 paths of carbon reduction that keep warming to 1.5 degrees, each requiring massive changes in personal behaviours, political structure, economy and technology. Every sector of society will need to join the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists are taking notice. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScA7q3Ob5CiKmub1UPKa1bIIB18mz2p-2Eo2ZDvfsW-0V9Z7g/viewform&quot;&gt;The Society for Neuroscience (SFN) recently hosted a satellite event about tackling climate change – more than 80 people participated&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thefreemanlab/status/1182379104110120960&quot;&gt;Jeremy Freeman stepped down from CZI to focus on climate change&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/swaziadam&quot;&gt;Adam Aron&lt;/a&gt; at UCSD &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(19)30202-5#.XW8Fxc-2-Z8.twitter&quot;&gt;published an editorial on why climate change needs attention from cognitive neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt;; and people like &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05433&quot;&gt;Konrad Kording, Demis Hassabis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adammarblestone.org/&quot;&gt;Adam Marblestone&lt;/a&gt; are publishing detailed breakdowns of the climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can a neuroscientist do about climate change? Neuroscience is not an engineering discipline, so it’s easy to feel powerless, but I’m going to try to show here we have a surprising amount of agency: personal agency, the power to convince, and the power to invent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Personal agency&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScA7q3Ob5CiKmub1UPKa1bIIB18mz2p-2Eo2ZDvfsW-0V9Z7g/viewform&quot;&gt;The SFN event ended in a petition to decarbonize the conference&lt;/a&gt;. This includes suggestions such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hosting satellite events closer to home to limit the amount of travel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;skipping the conference every other year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;integrating teleconferencing to attend remotely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As academics, much of our carbon footprint stems from flight. Assuming that the 30,000 attendees travel on average 10,000 kilometers to get to the conference, it’s roughly 70,000 tons of carbon in the atmosphere from air travel only – or the average annual CO2 emitted by 10,000 EU citizens. In research universities, air travel accounts for a large proportion of the carbon footprint of the institutions; for example, it’s estimated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab33e6/meta&quot;&gt;over 50% of the carbon footprint of Université de Montréal is from air travel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://hiltner.english.ucsb.edu/index.php/ncnc-guide/&quot;&gt;There are already excellent models for zero-carbon conferences&lt;/a&gt;. Traditional international conferences don’t make sense in a carbon-constrained world, and we can refuse to participate in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flying is one of most carbon-intensive behaviours scientists participate in, and one of the highest leverage items. Neuroscientists also consume resources to run their labs, and these resources – and the embodied carbon – are wasted when the products of the research are not shared. This is a strong argument for open science. A salient example of resource use is training state-of-the-art deep learning models, trading GPU cycles for classification accuracy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243&quot;&gt;One recent analysis estimated a carbon footprint of half a ton of CO2 for training a single NLP model (BERT); an architecture search over different networks yielded numbers in the hundreds of thousands of tons&lt;/a&gt;. Computational neuroscientists should share their trained models to prevent the wasted resources from re-training. Experimentalists should also share their data for the same reason. Data carries an embodied carbon footprint from the materials used to collect it (plastics, animal facilities, the carbon used to ship materials across borders, etc.), and publishing the existing data makes more use of the same amount of resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I’ve focused on activities specific to scientists, we can participate in the same carbon-cutting behaviours recommended for everyone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having fewer children&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;living car-less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eating a plant-based diet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using green energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;living in more modest houses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The power to convince&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 70% of people in the US believe that climate change is happening; that leaves 30% of people that remain to be convinced. Furthermore, only a small fraction of believers act. Neuroscientists, as teachers and science communicators, can help people graduate from disbelief to disengagement to action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have a lot of influence. They are consistently ranked among the most trusted professions in the US, and they can bring attention to important matters via teaching, their online presence and their political influence. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(19)30202-5#.XW8Fxc-2-Z8.twitter&quot;&gt;As Adam Aron points out in his editorial&lt;/a&gt;, people are more convinced about the urgency of the climate crisis when communicators adopt themselves a low-carbon lifestyle. So scientists’ power to convince is gated by their own adoption of the behaviours they want to see in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As academics, we have a higher standard of what it means to understand something, so before we go convincing, we have the duty to become well-informed. I think we can all take time to better understand the mechanisms of climate, the evidence for it, and its consequences. Plenty of resources are available to learn these materials; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edx.org/course/climate-change-the-science-and-global-impact&quot;&gt;a very good starting point is Michael Mann’s class on edX&lt;/a&gt;. Those more inclined to learn about the solution space should read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.withouthotair.com/&quot;&gt;late David Mackay’s book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that we’ve changed our own behaviours and learned how climate change works, we need to find ways to amplify our own actions and convince others to act. This forum can be the classroom; &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/t8s4k/&quot;&gt;Adam Aron’s class on climate change psychology&lt;/a&gt; gives us a template. This also has to include political activism; we can vote for parties that support carbon taxes and decarbonization; join grassroots advocacy groups; and support and participate in civil disobedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the research level, Adam Aron argues that cognitive neuroscientists can help the climate crisis by studying the mechanisms by which people acquire beliefs about climate change, how they propagate through their social networks, what kinds of messages they best respond to, and what motivates them to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mila.quebec/en/ai-society/visualizing-climate-change/&quot;&gt;For example, a group at MILA is working on generating flooded images&lt;/a&gt; of people’s homes so they can experience for themselves what it will be like to live in with a 6 foot sea level rise. The hypothesis is that people are emotional decision makers and will respond best to emotionally-loaded messages. These kinds of approaches are ripe to be studied from both a neuroscientific decision-making perspective and an econometric efficacy perspective. What causes people to graduate for disbelievers to believers? What causes people to move from belief to action? And how many tons of CO2 could we keep in the ground if we convinced 1,000 people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The power to invent&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many readers of this blog are technologists, engineers and programmers in addition to neuroscientists. Technological innovation will be crucial to limit climate change to 1.5 degrees. Software allows us to communicate climate change, to visualize it, predict it, plan for it, and mitigate it. Physical engineering will allow us to build the large-scale structures required to keep carbon in the ground. &lt;a href=&quot;http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/&quot;&gt;Bret Victor wrote an excellent blog post&lt;/a&gt; on how technologists can help climate change, and it is a very encouraging read. A  consortium of machine learning researchers, including Yoshua Bengio, Demis Hassabis and Konrad Kording wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.climatechange.ai/&quot;&gt;a sprawling 100-page paper with a companion website&lt;/a&gt; on how artificial intelligence can help climate change. By all means, if you’re a machine learning expert, pick a section in the paper labeled high leverage, and go work on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering is a very small part of neuroscience today, but it will grow in near future. Mainstream (i.e. 10M+ units) consumer-grade BCIs will likely appear on the market in the next 10 years. Meanwhile, decarbonization scenarios that will keep warming to 1.5 degrees will require sustained efforts over the next 80 years. Neuroscience research that might be considered far out has the potential to have massive impact in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning: speculation, thought experiments, future episodes of Black Mirror ahead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are opportunities at the growing convergence of AI and neuroscience. Suppose, for instance, that by studying the brain, we discover an algorithm that opens up a rich area of AI (e.g. reinforcement learning, multi-agent learning, few-shot learning, causal inference, etc.). Some of the applications of this algorithm could be used effectively to mitigate climate change. For instance, suppose one of the downstream applications is counterfactual reasoning in life-cycle analysis; then we could very easily optimize a supply chain to minimize the carbon footprint of a given product. In this case, we’re augmenting human reasoning using AI, itself inspired by human reasoning, with the end goal of tackling climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers are cognitive enhancers – Steve Jobs called them bicycles for the mind. People also use drugs to make themselves smarter, caffeine being the most salient example. People working on climate change may choose – indeed, may feel a moral imperative – to enhance themselves cognitively. The enhancement of well people (whether with nootropics, psychedelics or empathogens) is a taboo subject, but neuroscientists working on these areas  enhance the human potential to solve problems. The same point can be made about invasive BCIs for cognitive enhancement. Supplementing our memory, or having immediate access to a library of all human knowledge, could make us radically smarter, and more effective at fighting climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, humans could eventually choose to radically decrease their carbon footprint by leaving their physical bodies and uploading themselves to the cloud. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading&quot;&gt;While the capacity to emulate a single human brain in real-time using simplified biophysical models is not here yet, it should be feasible within the next 15 years&lt;/a&gt;. The cost of that simulation with today’s efficiency would be around a tenth of the power envelope of the United States. However, efficiency follows a similar trend to Moore’s law, with a doubling in operations per second every 1.5 years or so. At this rate, we could have whole brain emulation at a carbon intensity similar to that of 2019 human by 2055 – at which point uploading becomes carbon efficient, and rapidly more so over time. The carbon-negative technologies introduced in the 2060s might thus include foregoing our physical bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve highlighted three ways in which neuroscientists can help tackle the climate crisis: by changing their personal habits, by convincing others, and by inventing new ways to a carbonless future. We have to soberly evaluate our actions with respect to their causal impact, and live our lives accordingly. Neuroscience, like every sector of society, will have to change to tackle the defining challenge of this century.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;i style=&quot;color: #2c3338; background-color: #ffffff;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;“The sense of self is a hallmark of human experience. Each of us maintains a constellation of personal memories and personality traits that collectively define ‘who we really are'”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;So begins a &lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink0&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-23055-001&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, which reveals that who you “are” can easily be manipulated. Just imagining somebody else can alter all kinds of aspects of how you see yourself, even including your personality and memories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38542&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meghan Meyer at Dartmouth College and colleagues first asked 185 adults to recall a series of personal memories — a time they received good news or helped a friend in need, for example — and rate how they had felt during that event (on a scale ranging from completely negative to completely positive). Using the same scale, participants were prompted to imagine how others would have felt in reaction to the same events: both an “average American” and also a genuine friend who was similar to them in in personality, temperament, major likes and dislikes, beliefs and values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The participants were then given the original prompts again and asked to rate for a second time their own feelings at the time of the events. The team found these ratings had changed, to become closer to each participant’s assessments of how the others would feel. This effect was particularly strong when the other person was more similar to them — a friend, rather than an “average American”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;For the next study, a fresh group of participants rated themselves on 60 character traits (such as “charming” and “unreliable”), then rated both a friend who was similar to them and also an actual other person — in this case, Walter Cronkite, a former US news anchor — on a subset of 20 of these traits. Next, they rated themselves again. As in the previous study, the participants’ self-ratings changed, becoming closer to those for their friend in particular.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;In a second, remarkable part to this study, a very similar result was found when people were asked to imagine the characteristics of something radically different to themselves: the Empire State Building. The participants first rated themselves on various physical traits, such as being “clean” and “asymmetrical”, and then rated a similar friend and the Empire State Building. Finally, they rated themselves again — and as before, their own ratings had become more similar to those given for the two targets (and especially the friend). The team then went on to find that these “simulation-induced” changes in self-knowledge can still be in place 24 hours on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;How might thinking about other people, or even buildings, reshape your own self-knowledge? The researchers suspect that it happens because when you imagine how someone else looks or would feel and act in a given situation, you’re simultaneously retrieving memories about how you look and how you have felt and behaved in such situations in the past. When your own memories are retrieved, they become vulnerable to modification, which means those imagined reactions can influence your own real ones. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;For example, in thinking about how a friend might respond to being dumped, you may find yourself thinking, “Claire tends to be pretty thick-skinned”. When that knowledge and your relevant self-knowledge (eg. “I was embarrassed when I got dumped last year”) are retrieved simultaneously, considering your friend’s predicted response can tweak your own pre-existing self-knowledge. You might then recollect being less embarrassed about your own experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect might be especially potent when you’re considering someone who is similar (rather than different) to you, because thinking about such a person should trigger more self-related memories, which would then be vulnerable to being altered, the researchers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;So far, the researchers have only checked whether the changes they observed were still in place after a day. It’s not clear yet how long they might last, or whether they would result in any meaningful differences in behaviour. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;But the work does suggest that self-knowledge is just as susceptible to misinformation effects as other types of knowledge, the researchers conclude, adding: “Such findings offer a qualification to the argument that the self is ‘special’.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 More than five years after comments appeared on PubPeer about a 2012 paper in PLoS ONE with a raft of problematic images — and a deceased member of the group whom the corresponding author suggests might have been able to support the validity of the data — the journal has retracted the article.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gender inequality in the business world has been much discussed over the last few years, with a host of mentoring schemes, grants, business books and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/treasury-launches-review-into-barriers-for-women-in-business&quot;&gt;political activity&lt;/a&gt; all aimed at getting women into leadership positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens when this goal is achieved? According to new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspa0000176.pdf&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, unequal gender dynamics still prevail even at the very top. Nicole Votolato Montgomery and Amanda P. Cowen from the University of Virginia found that women CEOs are judged far more harshly than their male counterparts when a business fails ethically. However, when a failure is down to incompetence, they find, women receive less negative backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38534&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first experiment, 512 participants were given a news article to read about a car manufacturer, and then asked to fill out a survey on whether or not they would buy from the company. A third of participants read about an &lt;em&gt;ethical&lt;/em&gt; failure (the company had known of a vehicle’s defect but done nothing about it), a third read about a &lt;em&gt;competence&lt;/em&gt; failure (the company had not known about the failure) and a third simply read a description of the company. Gender of the company’s CEO was varied: some participants read that the CEO was named Adam, whilst others read they were named Abigail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were then asked how likely they were to buy a vehicle from the company, answered questions on the organisation’s competency, dependability and trust, and rated how severe they felt the failure was on a seven point scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an ethical failure had taken place, participants expressed less intent to buy a car from the company if they had read that the CEO was a woman than if they had read it was a man. But when the company &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; aware of the defect, they were more likely to report intent to buy if a woman was at the helm. There was no difference in intent for participants who read just the company description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second experiment, 416 participants read the same news article as those in the first — but in this piece of writing, female and male CEOs were described with either “communal” traits, stereotypically associated with women — e.g. “helpful”, “sensitive”, and “good at listening” —  or “agentic” traits associated with men — e.g. “independent”, and “works well under pressure”. Participants were then given the same survey questions as in the first experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When participants read about an ethical failure where the CEO’s traits were congruent with stereotypes — women as helpful, men as strong, for example — results from the first experiment held: intent to buy from the female-led company was lower. But this changed when the stereotypes were inconsistent with the CEO’s gender: participants were less likely to buy from an organisation led by a man described as “helpful” and “sensitive” than one led by a “independent” and “strong” woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team suggests that highlighting such traits in female leaders can “reduce the penalties for female-led organisations”. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2015/02/12/women-shouldnt-have-to-lead-like-men-to-be-successful/&quot;&gt;others argue&lt;/a&gt; that women leaders shouldn’t give in to the pressure of adopting typically “male” traits, and that being helpful and community-focused are actually positive things to bring to the board room. Leaning into stereotypes may not be the best way, long-term, to break them — but either way, it’s clear there’s still a way to go for women in business.&lt;/p&gt;

 A criminology professor at Florida State University whose work has been under the microscope for six months will have four papers retracted, Retraction Watch has learned. We first reported on the case of Eric Stewart, the FSU professor, in July, after Justin Pickett, one of the co-authors on one of the papers, posted a 27-page … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2019/11/19/criminologist-to-have-four-papers-retracted-following-months-of-scrutiny/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Criminologist to have four papers retracted following months of scrutiny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/Comment_preprint-image_blog-bubble3-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was co-written by Dan Morgan, Director of Community Relations; Rebecca Kirk, Associate Editorial Director, Madison Crystal, Brand Communications Manager; and Veronique Kiermer; Publisher and Executive Editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preprints enable authors to share their work early, openly, and in a way that is free from journal influence or stylistic preferences. They also open up possibilities for pre-publication commentary that have previously been limited to a group of trusted confidants and hand-selected (often anonymous) peer reviewers invited by the editors. The opening up of comments via email, Twitter, or on the preprint server has the potential to expand the number of voices involved in the peer review of manuscripts, to allow the development of a preprint in parallel with the formal peer review, and to accelerate the research process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore these opportunities, we recently launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/&quot;&gt;preprint commenting pilot&lt;/a&gt;, which will enable handling editors at PLOS Journals* to better access and utilize comments left on preprinted submissions for consideration in their review of the manuscript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the announcement speaks for itself, we also wanted to give more context for our work in engaging with preprints and facilitating comments more broadly. Driven by our work alongside the research community, these fall into three major strategic directions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. A more equitable platform for community review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS has always sought the most equitable systems of publishing, for all research and researchers. In preprints we have a posting and reviewing infrastructure that is not based on a closed database of reviewers end editorial board members, but open to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one conversation we might hear from editors who say they struggle to find reviewers for papers, and in another conversation we hear from scientists, especially early career researchers, who are looking for an opportunity to review or edit for a journal, but are not being invited. Editorial work is often labeled as a “volunteer” activity, but it is less a system of volunteering and more a system of being known and &lt;em&gt;chosen&lt;/em&gt;, in the current setup. And the best chance of being chosen, of course, lies with those who have been chosen in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By promoting preprints and their commenting infrastructure, PLOS is attempting to even more equitably open up editorial activity to all who have something to offer. And the various tools, vendors, publishers companies (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cshl.edu/transparent-review-in-preprints/&quot;&gt;TRiP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plaudit.pub/&quot;&gt;plaudit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.hypothes.is/&quot;&gt;hypothes.is&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006971333-Peer-Review&quot;&gt;ORCiD&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) are developing the infrastructure to enable it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Published outputs should be shaped by the &lt;em&gt;scholarly process&lt;/em&gt;, and not by publishers’ preferences or requirements. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS has long empowered scientists to publish great science. Our work as a publisher is essential and important, but it is not a proxy to judge the quality of our authors’ articles. Our journals are selective against a spectrum of criteria, but our efforts are always in &lt;em&gt;partnership with the community&lt;/em&gt; whose activities we facilitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some publishers, while they allow submissions that have been preprints, do not engage with them because they view them as a force that is too publisher- or journal-independent — a publishing movement that may one day reduce or even remove the need for journal brands completely. We see an opportunity to learn from our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, preprints represent the purest form of published output. While authors generally still follow standard article conventions, and many preprints have emerged from parallel posting alongside submission to PLOS, this is not a requirement. For PLOS it is extremely interesting to see how authors choose to write up their work when it is being posted on a preprint server, and not being “prepared” for a specific journal or editorial approach. Our hope is that a preprint culture helps empower authors to share their work early, often, and in their preferred way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. More editorial activity is better for all concerned, including researchers but also publishers, and may save everyone time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our pilot for flagging bioRxiv comments to editors is an attempt to see how useful such comments on preprints are for handling editors, how easy it is for us to identify and push them to the attention of editors, and whether this activity speeds up the reviewing process, increases the diversity of voices reviewing, AND encourages more people to comment on preprints. But the manuscript peer review will not solely rely on this new process–it is in parallel with the standard process and editors will consider the comments at their own discretion, based on how useful they determine the comments to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, for publishers, we believe there is always a need for more reviewers and more editors (especially when you operate one of the biggest journals in the world in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;!). We can’t think of a better way to expand the universe of relevant editorial activity than by both enabling a training &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;providing an open ground for new reviewers to demonstrate their expertise. The availability and openness of preprint comments, in conjunction with our new &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/&quot;&gt;published peer review history option&lt;/a&gt;, is finally surfacing the richness of these activities and resources and. And, as such, we look forward to the training and empowering of more diverse voices and to ever more early career reviewers to joining the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are expecting the results of the pilot to be mostly qualitative — the reality being that at the moment only 10% of bioRxiv preprints receive comments — but we will seek opinions from editors and authors about their experience and we will share our learnings broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/tweet.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-8897&quot; height=&quot;226&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/tweet-300x164.png&quot; width=&quot;413&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/siminevazire/status/1143465254980149248&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/siminevazire/status/1143465254980149248&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three strategic directions above focus on how engaging with preprints and comments may improve the publishing and reviewing process itself, and move it closer to a fully equitable, community-driven practice. But it would be remiss to not also mention the importance of the increased potential for credit for all research activity, which we will focus on in a future blog post. In short, and in advance, there are many ways that these preprint initiatives are natural extensions of our passion for surfacing credit for all researchers in their activities, already including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/07/author-credit-plos-and-credit-update/&quot;&gt;CRediT taxonomy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/06/youve-completed-your-review-now-get-credit-with-orcid/&quot;&gt;ORCID for Reviewers&lt;/a&gt;. More in due course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of open, please do leave us comments and questions below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*The commenting trial is available on submissions to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/&quot;&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/&quot;&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ntds/&quot;&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/pathogens/&quot;&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Body image can be a tricky enough thing to navigate in adulthood: for young people, it can be even more difficult. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4554432/&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that adolescence is a “pivotal time” for the development of positive or negative body image — and that poor body image can in turn have a devastating impact on overall self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how someone looks doesn’t just change how they feel about themselves — it can change the way other people treat them, too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.20171&quot;&gt;One 2013&lt;/a&gt; study found that weight was a factor in graduate school admissions, with overweight applicants less likely to receive an offer. And now &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjep.12322?af=R&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Educational Psychology&lt;/em&gt; suggests this bias can start before students are even in their teens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38519&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past research has found that obesity is related to poorer educational achievement, though exactly why has not been established. Kristin Finn and colleagues at Canisius College wondered whether it might come down to discrimination and stigma, pointing to several other studies that suggest this could be the case. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22531092&quot;&gt;2013 paper,&lt;/a&gt; for instance, found that obesity was related to &lt;em&gt;assessment&lt;/em&gt; of academic performance but not to standardised test scores: overweight children were just as smart but not as successful, as that research put it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this hypothesis further, the team recruited 133 teachers from suburban middle and high schools in New York State; the teachers were a variety of ages and &lt;span&gt;taught a range of subjects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Recruited at staff meetings, participants were asked to take part in a study ostensibly looking at the validity of school grading, and were given a short, handwritten essay on health and fitness to evaluate, written by an eleven-year-old student. The essays had been gathered from a separate classroom writing exercise and chosen precisely because they were of average quality — external educators had rated them neither excellent nor poor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were also provided with a picture of a young girl, purportedly the author of the essay — in one condition, a picture of a ‘healthy’ weight child, and in the other a picture of an overweight child. Photographs were, in fact, of the same girl — one was simply a digitally altered version, designed to add 20 pounds of weight.  After reading the essay, participants filled in a brief survey assessing the student and their essay, and also described their own beliefs about  biases in grading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, the team found that teachers believed characteristics such as race, gender, weight or attractiveness had “very little influence” on the grades they gave their students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But weight did in fact have a significant effect on the scores students received. Teachers were significantly more likely to recommend overweight students for tutoring or remedial help, judged their work as less neat than their non-overweight counterparts, and gave their essays lower grades overall — even though the essays were exactly the same. They also judged overweight students to have worked much harder than non-overweight students — perhaps because they were seen as less capable and therefore in greater need to try. Interestingly, even though teachers gave the overweight students lower grades, they didn’t consider the &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; of their essays to be any lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team suggests their findings illustrate the “weight-biased attitudes” often present in teachers: that although students can try just as hard or produce work of equally high quality, stereotypes about what it means to be overweight warp educators’ perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study only used images of white girls, so the way that weight interacts with other identities would be worth further research — how does weight interact with race, for example, and do the findings hold for male students, too? The team also notes that their research could be replicated with photographs that were not digitally altered or were full length, and the weight of teacher was also not taken into consideration: would an overweight teacher still hold the same biases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tackling bad body image in teenagers is a vital step towards the nurturing of happy, healthy adults. But to do that, deeply enmeshed attitudes towards weight will have to be undone. The first step may simply be acknowledging they exist — it’s notable that teachers were not aware that such biases affected the way they graded. Becoming more cognisant of the various factors that influence how we see other people is key. Overweight students are just as good: they should be treated as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjep.12322?af=R&quot;&gt;Weight bias and grading among middle and high school teachers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I know, I know, people will complain, but that is what I do. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Any brave soul willing to give it a go but who (like me) does not like to read long documents on the screen may like to print it out as a folded book. I have long used the Blue Squirrel software &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bluesquirrel.com/products/clickbook/&quot;&gt;ClickBook&lt;/a&gt; to do this. Alternatively, you can print booklets directly from word processing software like Word, and I am happy to send over a Word file to anyone who would like to do that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, the eBook is available as a pdf file &lt;a href=&quot;https://richardpoynder.co.uk/Jaws.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 Many people may be living life without a particular brain region - and not suffering any ill-effects.



In a new paper in Neuron, neuroscientists Tali Weiss and colleagues discuss five women who appear to completely lack olfactory bulbs (OB). 







According to most neuroscience textbooks, no OB should mean no sense of smell, because the OB is believed to be a key relay point for olfactory signals. As Wikipedia puts it:

		<link href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/609393366/0/oupblogpsychology/"/>
		<id>https://blog.oup.com/?p=143047</id>
		<updated>2019-11-16T14:30:07+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;In recent years, the term &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinx&quot;&gt;Latinx&lt;/a&gt; has become popular in academic settings in English to designate a group of people without reference to gender, which is designated by -o and -a endings in some Romance languages. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://medium.com/@ThinkNowTweets/progressive-latino-pollster-trust-me-latinos-do-not-identify-with-latinx-63229adebcea&quot;&gt;While academics and Twitter users have begun to use the term, only 2% of the U.S. population actually identifies with this word. &lt;/a&gt; Latinx has become so widely used that Elizabeth Warren has taken to using it on the campaign trail.  This has led to a reflection on its political implications in a recent Ross Douthat piece &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://nyti.ms/2JSDPcK&quot;&gt;in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/a&gt; The interesting question is why a term that is thought to help unify a large group of people would fail to gain wider traction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Spanish is my mother tongue, I can understand why this term would befuddle Spanish speakers.  From a linguistic perspective, it makes no sense to create a genderless word in a gender-marked language. Yes, the -o and -a endings signal the grammatical gender, such as in the terms &lt;em&gt;niño and niña. &lt;/em&gt;But the endings for the adult form are not always straightforward, such as in &lt;em&gt;el&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;hombre &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;la&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;mujer.&lt;/em&gt; In fact, all nouns carry grammatical gender and some of these end in -o/a (i.e. &lt;em&gt;la tierra)&lt;/em&gt; and others do not (i.e. &lt;em&gt;el arbol&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Finally, even within categories that have similar meanings there can be variation. In Spanish, it’s &lt;em&gt;el puma &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; la pantera. &lt;/em&gt;But in Italian, one would say &lt;em&gt;la tigre. &lt;/em&gt;Confused yet? Grammatical gender is confusing, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://lightonspanish.com/the-gender-of-animals-in-spanish/&quot;&gt;especially with regard to animals.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all this confusion, Spanish speakers lose a connection between sex and gender. No one would be insulted if they are considered part of &lt;em&gt;el pueblo Latino &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;la gente Latina. &lt;/em&gt;Just because someone says I am part of &lt;em&gt;la gente Latina&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t make me feel that they are referring only to women. For a speaker of this class of Romance languages, the notion that gender and sex are the same thing makes little sense. Yes, gender originates in sex but it is not the same thing when it comes to non-sexed nouns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem arises when we use a gender-marked Romance language term in English contexts. For example, one day I ran across a cover for &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; that characterizes Selena as “&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onnewsstandsnow.com/collections/newsweek/products/newsweek-selena-the-life-and-legacy-of-tejanos-queen?variant=7841788788789&quot;&gt;Tejano’s Queen&lt;/a&gt;.” I was confused by this. Did they mean &lt;em&gt;Tejano’s&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. people from Texas) music?  The word music was never used so I kept on reading.  I found that the special issue was “proud to present Selena, a 100-page tribute to the most beloved Tejano singer of all time.” Oh, so she was a Tejano singer and the reference was to music.  But, in fact, she would be &lt;em&gt;una cantante de musica&lt;strong&gt;Tejana&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;una cantante &lt;strong&gt;Tejana&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Either way, the gender would be feminine not masculine. &lt;em&gt;Tejana&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Tejano &lt;/em&gt;had been masculinized to the latter. This is not unusual for Anglophones. You might remember the once Terminator, and now ex-Governator, Arnold Schwarzenegger stating “No problemo.” The problem (no pun intended) is that it should be &lt;em&gt;No hay problema.&lt;/em&gt; Again, an Anglophone (probably the scriptwriters) masculinizes a Spanish noun. Spanish has two genders but for some reason Anglophones think there is only one. Thus, what grammatical gender is and is not becomes entirely lost when moving to a language where gender and sex are the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let’s leave my linguistic perch for a second and think about the implications of the term &lt;em&gt;X &lt;/em&gt;is. The term &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is sought as one that would be all inclusive. The term reminds me of algebra where &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; represents a variable that has no defined meaning.  As such it is perfectly suited for equations where a term is unknown.  In this case, it can take on any value and in human terms would represent a more inclusive term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with creating a new genderless word, is that it already exists in gender-marked languages that have a true neuter. There are two languages that come to mind when thinking about the lexical origins of English. One is German and the other is Latin. Of these two languages, Latin has the perfect solution. Not only does it contain a neuter but it also has a plural neuter, &lt;em&gt;Latinae.&lt;/em&gt; Rather than using a synthetically and anglophonically derived ending such as &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, we could opt for a more organic one that has its roots in the language that has influenced speakers across the planet. In that sense, &lt;em&gt;Latinae&lt;/em&gt; is all-inclusive and derives from a language that sought to create a genderless ending system. Latin is the natural language of science and the one used to represent complex concepts in English. &lt;em&gt;Latinae &lt;/em&gt;gets rid of a sex and gender bias, it is inclusive, and was actually used for that reason. Let’s go with a genderless solution from a gender-marked language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you miss the &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, you could tune in for reruns of &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;. Here, you would be presented with the motto “The truth is out there,” which also applies to our search for a genderless all-inclusive term &lt;em&gt;Latinae&lt;/em&gt; to replace &lt;em&gt;Latino/a/x.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verum illic&lt;/em&gt;, the truth is out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feature image credit:”Spanish dictionary” by Abigail Luke via &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.flickr.com/photos/185598731@N04/49090327886/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Flickr &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/a-linguists-perspective-on-the-popularity-of-the-word-latinx/&quot;&gt;The truth about ‘Latinx’&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/609393366/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/609393366/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/609393366/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/609393366/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/609393366/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/609393366/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/609393366/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/609393366/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/609393366/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/609393366/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/completing-your-verbs-infinitive-and-gerunds/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Completing your verbs—infinitive and gerunds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/universities-get-wrong-free-speech/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;What universities get wrong about free speech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/to-lie-doggo-an-idiom/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;“To lie doggo,” an idiom few people seem to know&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Dialysis-140x110.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an open access BMC Series journal that publishes original peer-reviewed articles on all aspects of the prevention, diagnosis, and management of kidney and associated disorders. The journal has been publishing articles for almost 20 years and has amassed more than 2,500 articles specific to the medical field of nephrology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journal is proudly affiliated with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://renal.org/&quot;&gt;Renal Association&lt;/a&gt;, a UK-based kidney-specific professional body, which has published guidance on best practice in the management of patients with kidney disease since 1995. These guidelines have been accredited by the UK’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nice.org.uk/&quot;&gt;National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/RACPG&quot;&gt;selection of these guidelines&lt;/a&gt; continue to be published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mark the journal’s 20th year of publishing, members of the journal’s Editorial Board and the Editors are delighted to announce that we will be launching a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/tag/bmc-nephrology/&quot;&gt;journal-specific blog&lt;/a&gt; to highlight the journal’s high-quality and topical published articles, which are of broad interest to nephrologists and researchers in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is involved in &lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt; blogs? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce that the journal has welcomed two Blog Editors to the Editorial Board, Daphne Harrington Knicely and Su Thavarajah, from John Hopkins University School of Medicine. Su and Daphne will be selecting journal content to highlight and writing the blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; “I’m excited to collaborate with Su on the BMC Nephrology Blog.  We look forward to highlighting the innovative articles from &lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt; and connecting them to clinical practice and patient care.” – Daphne Harrington Knicely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11444&quot; style=&quot;width: 169px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-11444&quot; height=&quot;199&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Daphne-Knicely-240x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;159&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Dr. Daphne Harrington Knicely&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Daphne Harrington Knicely is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Daphne is committed to medical education with involvement in multiple teaching programs at Johns Hopkins. Daphne has a special interest in patient education and outcomes and is the co-director of patient education within the Division of Nephrology at Johns Hopkins. She helped establish the Johns Hopkins Nephrology Patient Education Program and is dedicated to improving kidney disease awareness. Daphne is a member of several committees for the National Kidney Foundation serving Maryland and Delaware and has special expertise in diabetic kidney disease, solitary kidney, and renal replacement therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope that the blog will serve as a great conversation starter and introduce these publications to a broader audience.  There is so much exciting work being done in the nephrology field that many of our colleagues are not aware of. We hope this blog brings this work to the forefront” – Su Thavarajah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11445&quot; style=&quot;width: 168px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-11445&quot; height=&quot;198&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Sumeska-Thavarajah-240x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;158&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Dr. Sumeska Thavarajah&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sumeska Thavarajah is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Su is committed to education and dedicated to bringing community awareness on kidney disease through her work with the National Kidney Foundation serving Maryland and Delaware. Su has served as the Chairman of its Medical Advisory Board for the last six years and has been a member of the board since 2012. Much of Su’s work has focused on the development of patient education programs for dialysis and transplant options. She has been honored with the National Kidney Foundation’s Linda Cameron Award for Patient Services, for donating her time at community health screenings and assisting the Programs &amp;amp; Advocacy committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adding a blog to &lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt; seems to be the natural next step to promote the journal, highlight our new scientific publications, and putting them in context of current scientific trend with the help of our experienced blog editors, Daphne and Su.” – Bernard Jaar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11446&quot; style=&quot;width: 166px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-11446&quot; height=&quot;206&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Bernard-Jaar-227x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;156&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Dr. Bernard Jaar&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also supporting this project will be Dr. Bernard Jaar, also an Assistant Professor at John Hopkins University Medical School and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He is an associate faculty of the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research and a Senior Staff nephrologist at the Nephrology Center of Maryland.

For his dedication to the journal, he won Section Editor of the Year in 2014. Bernard leads the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/sections/epidemiology-and-health-outcomes&quot;&gt;Epidemiology and health outcomes&lt;/a&gt; section of the journal, with Deputy Section Editor, Dr. Laura Plantinga. Bernard is especially interested in the epidemiology of chronic kidney disease, survival in dialysis patients, and associated cardiovascular disease but also environmental factors and their effect on the kidney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I access the blogs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blogs will be posted regularly on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/tag/bmc-nephrology/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology &lt;/em&gt;blogs page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; We will also provide links to this page on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;journal’s homepage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could greater empathy help heal our current political divisions?&lt;/strong&gt; Not according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/empathy-is-tearing-us-apart/&quot;&gt;this &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; by Robert Wright. Researchers have found that more empathy for an “in group” may actually relate to greater hostility towards the “out group”. People with higher levels of empathy were more likely to be support no-platforming a speaker from an opposing party, for instance, and even showed more amusement when they read that a bystander in favour of that speaker had been hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38507&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Guardian’s&lt;/em&gt; “Science Weekly” podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2019/nov/08/taking-on-eysenck-one-mans-mission-to-challenge-a-giant-of-psychology-science-weekly-podcast&quot;&gt;focuses on the controversy surrounding work by Hans Eysenck&lt;/a&gt;, which purported to find strong links between personality and cancer risk&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s a great place to start if you haven’t been following the saga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/it-is-okay-to-lose-confidence-in-your-previous-research&quot;&gt;story by Dalmeet Singh Chawla&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Index &lt;/em&gt;highlights recent research from the “Loss of Confidence Project”, which aims to encourage scientists to declare when they’ve lost confidence in their past findings&lt;/strong&gt;. Half of respondents to an online survey said they’d lost confidence in some of their previous results, due to a combination of mistakes, misjudgements, and questionable research practices. However, less than 20% had publicly reported these doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The latest trend to sweep Silicon Valley is so-called “dopamine fasting,” in which people abstain from pleasurable or stimulating experiences for a period of time&lt;/strong&gt;. Is it perhaps just a fancy way of saying “taking a break”, couched in some pseudo-neuroscientific language? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/11/13/20959424/dopamine-fasting-silicon-valley-trend-neuroscience&quot;&gt;Sigal Samuel has the answers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media has changed the way we interact and communicate with each other — and in doing so, has threatened democracy as we know it&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s the argument of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/12/social-media-democracy/600763/&quot;&gt;feature in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Jonathan Haidt and Tobias Rose-Stockwell, which touches on some of the same issues we’ve explored here at &lt;em&gt;Research Digest&lt;/em&gt; this week, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/13/the-paradox-of-viral-outrage-public-shaming-inspires-further-outrage-but-also-increases-sympathy-for-the-offender/&quot;&gt;outrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/14/psychological-study-of-moral-grandstanding-helps-explain-why-social-media-is-so-toxic/&quot;&gt;moral grandstanding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pigs can now be added to the elite group of animals that are able to use tools&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/add-another-animal-to-the-list-of-tool-users-pigs/&quot;&gt;reports Karinna Hurley&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers at a zoo in Paris observed a Visayan warty pig called Priscilla using bits of bark to help dig out a nest. Other pigs even seemed to have learned the skill from her, they found. Check &lt;span&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the digging pigs in this video:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it about social media that makes discussions about controversial topics so caustic and unpleasant? A variety of reasons have been put forward — such as the tendency for outrage to self-perpetuate, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/13/the-paradox-of-viral-outrage-public-shaming-inspires-further-outrage-but-also-increases-sympathy-for-the-offender/&quot;&gt;we reported earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;. But now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223749&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;PLoS One&lt;/em&gt;, implicates a concept so far explored in philosophy rather than psychology. This is “moral grandstanding” — publicly opining on morality and politics to impress others, and so to seek social status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38492&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;To engage in moral grandstanding, it’s the motivation behind the comments or statements that really matters: the individual is seeking to gain status, rather than simply to express their sincerely-held beliefs. Moral grandstanding can take many forms, the researchers write: “in a quest to impress peers, someone may trump up moral charges, pile on in cases of public shaming, announce that anyone who disagrees with them is obviously wrong, or exaggerate emotional displays in taking ideological positions.” They may also ramp up the situation, seeking to out-do others in their outrage. This concern with increasing one’s influence, rank or social status is, of course, a common characteristic of discourse on social media.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Given its relationship with status-seeking, Joshua Grubbs at Bowling Green State University and colleagues figured that moral grandstanding should also be amenable to examination as a psychological phenomenon. They hypothesised that it would be characterised by strivings for dominance or prestige, and may be associated with personality traits related to status-seeking, such as narcissism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The team first designed a questionnaire to assess dominance- and prestige-seeking as sub-scales of “moral grandstanding motivations”. The ultimate short-form, 10-item scale asks participants the extent to which they agree or disagree (on a 7-point scale) with statements including “My moral/political beliefs should be inspiring to others” (relating to prestige) and “I share my moral/political beliefs to make people who disagree with me feel bad” (relating to dominance).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;In the first three studies — two on groups of students, and one on a nationally representative group of more than 1,000 US participants — the team administered their scale, plus a battery of other tests, including personality tests, questions about political affiliation and measures of the participants’ experience of political or moral conflict (whether — and how often — they’d experienced conflict in the home or got into fights on social media, for example, because of their political and moral beliefs).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;They found consistent results. Higher scores on prestige-seeking were associated with narcissistic extraversion and extraversion more generally, while the dominance aspects were strongly associated with narcissistic antagonism (a willingness to exploit others for personal gains), and related to lower conscientiousness, agreeableness and openness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Political ideology had no relationship with moral grandstanding scores. But higher scores on both sub-scales did correlate with greater reported conflict with people holding different political and moral views (and this wasn’t simply because of differences in participants’ personality traits).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further, month-long study provided preliminary evidence that individual differences in moral grandstanding are relatively stable over time. In this study, the team also found evidence that while dominance-related motivations predicted conflict with people with differing views on political and moral issues, prestige-seekers reported growing closer to other people with the same views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final study of 1,776 US adults revealed that both prestige- and dominance-strivings were associated with more self-reported social media behaviours consistent with grandstanding — re-posting something that a participant disagreed with to make fun of it, or reposting something that they agreed with to make themselves look good, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;“Collectively, these findings provide support for an account of moral grandstanding that conceptualises it as a status-seeking behaviour that is driven by status-seeking motives,” and that could explain some of the problems with social discourse, especially on social media, the team writes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The researchers do acknowledge limitations to their study. It relied on self-reports of conflicts and social media behaviour, for example. More work should now be done to build on the preliminary evidence, they argue, in part because of the urgent need to understand the potential real-world implications. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The long-term implications of grandstanding are not yet known,” they write, “though, should philosophical speculation hold true, it is likely that this phenomenon is associated with polarisation and break-downs in effective communication, particularly with outgroup members or in-group members whom one perceives as a rival.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223749&quot;&gt;Moral grandstanding in public discourse: Status-seeking motives as a potential explanatory mechanism in predicting conflict&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Such knowledge can be effectively utilised by healthcare professionals and decision makers if the appropriate techniques are employed to deal with high-volume, high-velocity, high-variety, and often arguable veracity user-generated content online. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-019-0921-x&quot;&gt;research article&lt;/a&gt;, published this month in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making&lt;/a&gt;, the authors aimed to investigate the potential of Twitter data for Hay Fever surveillance purposes and validate the effectiveness of &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;relevant&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; content curation using state-of-the-art Deep Learning models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11415 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/cell-phone-1245663_960_720-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why health surveillance from Social Media?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2014.01.002&quot;&gt;Numerous studies&lt;/a&gt; have already demonstrated that Twitter users openly share health-related information (i.e. symptoms, treatments) with their online networks. So far, real-time surveillance of infectious diseases (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2145600&amp;amp;picked=formats&quot;&gt;Influenza&lt;/a&gt;) from Social Media has been extensively investigated in literature, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7403639&quot;&gt;while allergic conditions still remain largely unexplored&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/chronic-respiratory-conditions/allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever/contents/allergic-rhinitis&quot;&gt;1 in 5 Australian suffered from Hay Fever in 2014-15&lt;/a&gt;, becoming one of the most common chronic respiratory diseases. Due to environmental changes and increasing pollution, Pollen Allergy is dangerously on the rise, not only in Australia, but also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldallergy.org/wao-white-book-on-allergy&quot;&gt;worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current attempts to Hay Fever estimation include either official statistics or marketing polls. More recently, the data obtained from GP prescriptions, hospital admissions, pollen rates, and antihistamine sales have been utilised. Existing approaches are both time-consuming and cost-intensive, and provide only a high level of detail about the condition (usually answers to pre-specified questions). Given the limitations, Social Media has become an attractive alternative as the real-time data is extracted automatically in an unobtrusive manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11416 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/allergy-1738191_960_720-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;Challenges associated with user-generated content&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the wealth of knowledge available on Social Media platforms, the raw form of user-generated content proves highly challenging in &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;relevant&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; content extraction (i.e. &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Hay Fever self-reports) due to a large number of advertisements, news, warnings, etc. (even though still related to Hay Fever). What is more, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/educ.1120.0105&quot;&gt;user-written posts frequently abound in grammatical errors, ambiguous phrases, creative expressions, and so on&lt;/a&gt;. For example, how to automatically identify that tweet &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘I’m not crying, it’s my Hay Fever playing up’ &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt;refers to the most common Hay Fever symptom (watery eyes)? Or how to train the system to recognise that &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;Telfast&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is the commercial name of popular Hay Fever medication without the extensive list of &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of the potential medications provided a priori?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deep Learning as promising solution for challenging content curation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in Machine Learning, in particular its sub-field called Deep Learning, show great promise in highly challenging user-generated content curation. Providing system with even relatively small sample of class positive and class negative examples (in natural language), and letting the model to identify the most distinctive features between both classes, has already proved successful in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29155996&quot;&gt;healthcare domain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.3390/app9061123&quot;&gt;beyond&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the implementation of state-of-the-art in Natural Language Processing word embeddings into the model training further improves the accuracy and robustness of the approach. That is, word-to-vector representation (word embedding) allows to account for syntactic and semantic linkages between words (&lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;similar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; words occur in &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;similar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; contexts). This is due to a nearby position of the conceptually-related terms in the projected vector space (e.g. &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;bee&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;honey&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are closer to &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;pollen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;spores&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;fossils&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt;). As a result, &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;tears&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; can be linked to &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;watery eyes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;sniffles&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;runny nose&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; without explicit rules definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;Case study of Hay Fever surveillance from Twitter in Australia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study conducted in Australia aimed to investigate the potential of Twitter data for Hay Fever surveillance purposes and validate the effectiveness of &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;relevant&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; content curation using state-of-the-art Deep Learning models (still in infancy in health informatics domain). The primary data was extracted over the 6-month period, covering the high pollen season. The number Hay Fever self-reports from Twitter users peaked around October and November, as expected. The accuracy of relevant posts detection (e.g. symptoms, treatments) was up to 88% for the highest performing model (GRU) and pre-trained word embeddings (GloVe). The major contribution of our work includes the implicit symptoms and emerging treatments automatic detection, without pre-defined rules specification. The results prove promising for real-time health surveillance from an alternative source such as Social Media source, and serves as an attractive complement to currently limited approaches to Pollen Allergy prevalence and severity estimation.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/BMCWordle-620x342-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Health Services Research&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– &lt;strong&gt;Cry for health: a quantitative evaluation of a hospital-based advocacy intervention for domestic violence and abuse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-019-4621-0&quot;&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Health Services Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that locating Independent Domestic Violence Advisors (IDVAs) in hospitals is an effective  response to domestic violence and abuse (DVA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DVA includes a range of types of abuse, including, but not limited to, physical, psychological, financial, sexual or emotional abuse. DVA can have severe health consequences, with survivors at higher risk of experiencing anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, loss of trust, suicidal behaviours and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11424 alignright&quot; height=&quot;168&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/mujer-domestic-abuse-300x168.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halliwell &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;present findings from a multi-site evaluation of hospital-based IDVAs conducted in the UK. Hospital IDVAs provide immediate support and advice to victims of domestic abuse, link victims to community-based support and provide hospital staff with expert training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study highlights the advantages of locating IDVAs in hospitals: IDVAs are more likely to engage with survivors at an earlier point in the abusive relationship, identify “hidden” survivors not visible to other services and provide access to longer-term community interventions and health-based services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of hospital-based IDVAs, however the study suggests these services offer a unique opportunity of effectively helping victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Geriatrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;strong&gt;Anticholinergic and benzodiazepine medication use and risk of incidence of dementia: a UK cohort study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recurrent prescribing of some common anticholinergic drugs may increase dementia risk, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1280-2&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; reveals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is at present no cure for dementia. However, dementia can be prevented by acting on modifiable risk factors. Long-term use of several medications such as anticholinergics and benzodiazepines has been suggested to increase dementia risk. These medications are highly used among adults for conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, depression, epilepsy and insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11425 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/old-walking-2-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Geriatrics &lt;/a&gt;gathers data from a UK prospective, multicentre cohort study, specifically designed to estimate the prevalence, risk factors and course of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings demonstrate that at 10 year follow-up, recurrent use of anticholinergic medications classed as ACB3 according to the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden scale (medications that may cause delirium) are associated with dementia. The cognitive decline particularly affects patients with a good baseline cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study indicates that long-term anticholinergic use should be avoided in older people. Anticholinergic use represents therefore a potentially important modifiable risk factor for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– &lt;strong&gt;How organisations promoting vaccination respond to misinformation on social media: a qualitative investigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organisations promoting vaccines face multiple challenges on social media, including spread of false information and anti-science attitudes. Misinformation relating to vaccines poses a significant health threat. It is associated with decrease in vaccination rates and a risk of disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media is a place where you don’t need to support your claims…It’s kind of like the Wild West in terms of making claims about immunisation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-7659-3&quot;&gt;Steffens &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; explored the strategies, perspectives and experiences of Australian professionals working to promote vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/a&gt; provides a better understanding of the current vaccine hesitancy and provides clear recommendations to address vaccine misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on their findings, the authors highlighted the need to engage with audiences to build trust, to respond to concerns about risks and communicate with openness prioritizing facts. The study also encourages partnership with organisations sharing similar values to create a strong collective pro-vaccine voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– &lt;strong&gt;A prospective study of maternal postnatal depressive symptoms with infant-feeding practices in a Chinese birth cohort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postnatal depression (PND) is a mental disorder characterized by a persistent low mood in new mothers. It is a serious condition that can affect mother´s ability to bond with the baby and have long-term consequences for the infant development and cognition.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11427 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/baby-feeding-200x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2559-1&quot;&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/a&gt; explored infant feeding behaviours among women who experienced PND in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results show that women with symptoms of PND have shorter breastfeeding duration, are at higher risk of exclusive breastfeeding cessation at 6 months and more likely to provide the supplementary formula to their infants in the first year of life. The study highlights the importance of screening for symptoms of PND as one of the possible factors of adverse feeding outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Bioinformatics&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– &lt;strong&gt;PlantSimLab: a modelling and simulation web tool for plant biologists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the molecular level, complex molecular networks control many biological processes. Integration of experimental biology and mathematical modelling is a valuable approach to study biological systems. However, one of the challenges faced by life scientists, is they usually lack the expertise to use mathematical models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11429 alignright&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/scientists-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-3094-9&quot;&gt;Ha &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; present a new tool that helps plant scientists use mathematical models for hypothesis generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PlantSimLab software was developed with the focus on plant biology with a team of plant biologist determining the different features and functionalities. This tool can be used by biologists without direct assistance from mathematicians or computer science specialists. The tool enables users to build, validate and use dynamic models to test hypothesis and explore results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-6094&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/woman-sitting-on-chair-while-looking-upwards-3126016-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;On February 21, 1875, one year before Alexander Graham Bell filed his patent for the telephone, a baby girl, Jeanne Louise Calment, was born in Arles, France. She was alive to witness the invention of the aeroplane, the cinema, on a trip to Paris, saw the Eiffel Tower being built and she reported she met Vincent Van Gogh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In 1997, the same year Princess Diana died, Calment finally passed away. She was 122 years and 164 days old. Although blind, almost deaf and confined to a wheelchair, Calment reportedly remained spirited and ‘alert as a hummingbird’ till the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The French called her ‘la doyenne de l’humanitè’ (the elder of humankind). Despite the occasional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/study-questions-age-worlds-oldest-woman-180971153/&quot;&gt;counter-claim&lt;/a&gt;, she still holds the &lt;a href=&quot;http://guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-person-(female)&quot;&gt;record&lt;/a&gt; for the world’s longest-ever living human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the final article of a series of lessons in brain health from our elders — those folk who lived the longest and healthiest. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calment lived an extraordinary life for a woman of her generation. She attended school until the age of sixteen and graduated with a diploma. At twenty-one she married a wealthy distant cousin and recounted to biographers the details of their active lifestyle within the upper society of Arles, pursuing hobbies such as fencing, cycling, mountaineering, swimming, hunting, playing piano and painting, and going to the opera in Marseilles. ‘I had fun; I am having fun,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her life was not without sadness. Calment survived her husband, her daughter Yvonne who died at thirty-six in 1934 and her grandson Frédéric who died in 1963.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked her secret to old age, Jeanne Calment attributed her longevity to immunity to stress and a good attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t afraid of anything. I was often reproached for that. I took pleasure when I could, I acted clearly and morally and without regret. I’m very lucky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calment reportedly ate more than two pounds of chocolate a week, treated her skin with olive oil, rode a bicycle until she was 100, and only quit smoking when she was 117 because she became too proud to ask someone else to light her cigarettes! Known for her wit, she is widely reported as saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve never had but one wrinkle, and I’m sitting on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard work, raw eggs, biking and no regrets. We clamour to learn their secrets, and typically the oldest of the old love to share their long-won wisdom. Calment once quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wait. For death and journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In an impressive feat of brain plasticity, an enriching life experience changed Jeanne Calment’s brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;When she was 118, the neuropsychologist, Karen Ritchie, visited a number of times over a six-month period to examine Calment and submit her to a battery of neuropsychological tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ritchie &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/drm/007/3-4.pdf&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Until this programme of testing was commenced J.C. had no contact with the outside world apart from the occasional greeting from medical staff and an annual visit from journalists on the occasion of her birthday. For the last three years she has spent her days alone in her room in her armchair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to records, Calment enjoyed contributing to the study by recalling the poems, fables and songs she had learned as a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;I don’t lack for anything. I have everything I need. I’ve had a good life. I live in my dreams, in my memories, beautiful memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Brain scans showed atrophy of Calment’s cortex, but her overall cognitive performance was, in fact, far better than might have been predicted from the extent of brain loss observed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There is no evidence at present of senile dementia . . . Executive functions (principally controlled by frontal areas), while having deteriorated from young adult levels, appear to be relatively spared . . . This raises the question of whether an initially high level of intellectual ability may have been a protective factor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Remarkably, over the six months of Ritchie conducting the testing program, Calment’s test scores &lt;em&gt;improved&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Her verbal recall, narrative recall, verbal fluency and mathematics scores improved from baseline to match those of the average seventy-five to eighty-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Environmental enrichment by way of social interaction from Ritchie and her team activated the latent plasticity in Calment’s exceptionally long-lived brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Jeanne Calment no doubt had memories that she didn’t share but there was one secret that she wanted to pass on: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Always keep your sense of humour. That’s what I attribute my long life to. I think I’ll die laughing. That’s part of my program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/bats-ntds_Image-4-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8883 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/bats-ntds_Image-4-1-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In the Northwest Indian state of Nagaland, local ethnic groups have conducted bat harvests for many generations as a source of food and traditional medicine. Now, authors of a recent PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0007733&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; show that these Nagaland bats may carry Ebola viruses, with the first report of filovirus reactive antibodies in both humans and bats in a region with no historical record of Ebola virus disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors note: “Our results reinforce the need to select sentinel sites for virus surveillance at the human-animal interface and highlights some of the gaps in our understanding of filovirus transmission and ecology,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/iceman-image_oct-blog.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8884 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/iceman-image_oct-blog-300x169.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ötzi the Iceman is a 5,300-year-old human mummy found frozen in ice approximately 3,200 meters above sea level in the Italian Alps. The preservation of his body, clothing, and gear is remarkable—and that’s not all. He was found alongside an abundant assemblage of plants and fungi, the subject of this recent PLOS ONE study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tiny flora provide big clues to the Iceman’s fate: 70% of the identified plant and fungi species are non-local and were transported to the spot in Ötzi’s gut and clothing or by mammalian herbivores whose droppings ended up frozen alongside the Iceman. These non-local species help confirm the path Ötzi took to his final resting place: several of the identified moss species thrive today in the lower Schnalstal valley, suggesting that Ötzi traveled along the valley during his ascent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author James Dickson adds: “Most members of the public are unlikely to be knowledgeable about bryophytes (mosses and liverworts). However, no fewer than 75 species of these important investigative clues were found when the Iceman (aka Ötzi) was removed from the ice. They were recovered as mostly small scraps from the ice around him, from his clothes and gear, and even from his alimentary tract. Those findings prompted the questions: Where did the fragments come from? How precisely did they get there? How do they help our understanding of the Iceman?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors painted two cows with white zebra-like stripes, two with black stripes, and left two cows unpainted as controls. After nine days, a mere 55 flies were observed on the zebra cows, compared with 111 on the black-painted cows and 128 on the control cows. Furthermore, the zebra-striped cows demonstrated fewer fly-repelling behaviors (like flicking their tails and shaking their heads) compared with the black-striped and control cows. These results suggest that painting zebra-esque stripes on cattle can prevent biting fly attacks without the use of pesticide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spend any amount of time online and you’re likely to see the same patterns repeat themselves over and over again: somebody says something offensive or controversial on social media, they’re met with anger and disgust, and they either apologise or double down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some, this cycle has become somewhat of a career, with the garnering of outrage forming the backbone of their (often incredibly tedious) public personas. But does responding to such toxic or offensive remarks, especially en masse, actually work? Or does it simply increase sympathy for the offender, no matter how bigoted their remarks were to begin with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550619853595&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science,&lt;/em&gt; the latter is more likely. The paper looked at the impact of viral outrage on convincing observers that an offender is blameworthy — and found that as outrage increased, observers believed it was “more normative” to express condemnation, but simultaneously believed that outrage was excessive and felt more sympathy for the offender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38476&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across seven studies, Takuya Sawaoka and Benoît Monin from Stanford University showed 3,406 participants offensive social media posts, such as a woman taking a selfie at a concentration camp and a man making a sexist comment about the Women’s March in 2017 — all inspired by things that had really gone viral. The number of outraged reactions was manipulated across conditions — in the non-viral outrage condition, participants read two outraged responses, with those in the other condition were shown ten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first few studies, participants were shown the post and asked to indicate how offensive and how funny they found it on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 7 (very). They then read the responses condemning the post, also inspired by real comments on the event, and were asked another set of questions. These included questions about intentionality, such as “how much do you think the poster intended to hurt people with what they said?”, and others relating to whether the participant believed the poster should be punished by the social media platform or by their friends and employers. Participants were also asked how sympathetic and outraged they were by the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that viral outrage was frequently perceived as disproportionate, leading to increased sympathy for the poster compared to the non-viral condition. But despite their sympathy, participants didn’t express any less condemnation for the poster when outrage was viral. That seemed to be because higher levels of outrage also meant participants felt condemnation was the norm, making them both &lt;span&gt;feel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;more outrage themselves and more likely to express it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In further studies, the team found the same pattern of results, regardless of how offensive the original post was, and whether the poster was a lay person or a high-status public figure. And interestingly, one study also showed that participants believed others were less sympathetic and more outraged than they were themselves — meaning concerns over so-called “outrage culture” may be overlooking how sympathetic we really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research highlights what the team describes as the “strange bedfellows” of outrage and sympathy: the complex, sometimes counterintuitive, interaction between the two. And while it may be a common way of expressing moral judgement, the team concludes that outrage has “limited efficacy” when it comes to actually persuading people that someone has committed a moral misstep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the research couldn’t reveal is how people respond when outraged comments don’t just number in the tens but in the thousands. When posts really do go viral, they have significantly more &lt;span&gt;than just two or ten &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;responses, and it’s unclear how this changes the way we respond — though the team speculates that it would only strengthen people’s beliefs that condemnation was excessive and increase their sympathy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would also be interesting to understand how viral outrage impacts social norms in a broader sense: whilst sympathy may increase in individual cases, does widespread, vocal outrage actually help change wider attitudes around sexism, racism or transphobia, for example?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might not be able to stop yourself responding to the next outrageous thing you see on your Twitter or Facebook feed — and when it comes to bigotry, that instinct is probably a good one. But, as this study shows, it may also be worth thinking of other strategies to ensure that deeply offensive beliefs are stamped out of public life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550619853595&quot;&gt;Outraged but Sympathetic: Ambivalent Emotions Limit the Influence of Viral Outrage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a short notification that the two neuroscience planets have moved to the
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; URL space. They can now be found at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuroblog.fedoraproject.org/planet-neuroscientists/&quot;&gt;Planet Neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuroblog.fedoraproject.org/planet-neuroscience/&quot;&gt;Planet Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planet instances on my personal space will remain functional for the next
few weeks till the end of November, after which I'll stop updating them. Please
update your links/bookmarks. Since this is all hosted on Github pages, setting
up permanent redirects is not easy but we'll see what we can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuroblog.fedoraproject.org/planet-neuroscientists/&quot;&gt;Planet Neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt; collects RSS feeds from various neuroscience blogs
and web-sites. This is a good read for non-experts. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuroblog.fedoraproject.org/planet-neuroscience/&quot;&gt;Planet Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, on
the other hand, collects RSS feeds from various publication sources. So, the
main content here will consists of peer-reviewed publications and pre-prints.
They are updated twice a day at the moment, which seems to work well enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add both these to your RSS feed reader by using the &quot;Feeds&quot; drop-down
in the top right hand corner. You can also download the complete blog-roll
there and choose individual feeds to add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are both hosted on the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/neurofedora&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora Github space&lt;/a&gt;. You can suggest more feeds to be added to
the planets too, either by opening an issue/pull request in the Github source
repositories, or by getting in touch with the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; team via any of our
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/communicating/&quot;&gt;communication channels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is volunteer driven initiative and contributions in any form always
welcome.  You can get in touch with us &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/overview/#_communicating_and_getting_help&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
We are happy to help you learn the skills needed to contribute to the project.
In fact, that is one of the major goals of the initiative---to spread technical
knowledge that is necessary to develop software for Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Deepak Panday will talk about the paper &quot;Unsupervised Feature Selection for Large Data sets&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last decade saw a considerable increase in the availability
of data. Unfortunately, this increase was overshadowed by various
technical difficulties that arise when analysing large data sets.
These include long processing times, large requirements for data
storage, and other technical issues related to the analysis of
high-dimensional data sets. By consequence, reducing the cardinality
of data sets (with minimum information loss) has become of interest
to virtually any data scientist. Many feature selection algorithms
have been introduced in the literature, however, there are two main
issues with these. First, the vast majority of such algorithms
require labelled samples to learn from. One should note it is often
too expensive to label a meaningful amount of data, particularly
when dealing with large data sets. Second, these algorithms were
not designed to deal with the volume of data we have nowadays.
This paper introduces a novel unsupervised feature selection
algorithm designed specifically to deal with large data sets.
Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Molecular_model_of_the_pre-pore_form_of_a_MACPF_protein_based_upon_the_structure_of_pneunolysin-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11383&quot; style=&quot;width: 294px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-11383&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/one.png&quot; width=&quot;284&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Fig 1: Lipids phase separate into hydrophobic bilayers&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipids are insoluble in water, so they are synthesized in a membrane bilayer that makes a separate phase, like a layer of oil forming on water (Figure 1). Since most lipid-synthesizing enzymes are localised to just one membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotic cells or the inner membrane of bacteria, there is a major question: how can lipids transfer to another membrane? A method that might work on the face of it is traffic of vesicles made&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from membrane patches. However, the data do not support this. Traffic of vesicles in eukaryotic cells cannot provide lipids to organelles such as lipid droplets, mitochondria and peroxisomes. Even more definitively, the vast majority of cells that require lipid traffic are bacteria with 2 membranes (such as &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;), which have no membrane vesicles. This means that life on earth solved the question of lipid traffic long before vesicular traffic evolved. This paper is part of a trend to return the field of lipid transfer back to it’s roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11384&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11384&quot; height=&quot;163&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/two-300x163.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Fig 2: Lipids, by analogy with crude oil, can be transported in small discrete amounts (barrels) or larger continuous amounts in pipes&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipids are trafficked to their intended location by Lipid Transfer Proteins (LTPs). These come in two types: ‘boxy’ LTPs that resemble lidded boxes that can select cargo lipids for transport across water filled gaps such as the cytosol, like an oil barrel that can be filled with crude oil; and ‘groovy’ LTPs that resemble half-pipes through which large quantities of cargo can flow (Figure 2). The pipes are relative new discoveries that suggest the intriguing possibility that lipids can simply slide from one membrane to another at so-called “membrane contact sites” where membranes come closest together. The typical gaps at these sites is 15-20 nm, which matches the lengths of the known half-pipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11385&quot; style=&quot;width: 315px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-11385&quot; height=&quot;414&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/three-221x300.png&quot; width=&quot;305&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Fig 3: LEFT: four types of “Groovy” LTPs have been identified in the intermembrane space (IMS) of bacteria: two pure TULIPs, one Chorein-N, which combines with a -taco rod, and one mixed. RIGHT: eukaryotic cells contain many TULIPs and Chorein-N LTPs at membrane contact sites, for example at ER-mitochondrial junctions. Mitochondria in some species have homologues of the bacterial Chorein-N protein. Transmembrane domains and protein receptors anchor LTPs to membranes to stabilise them in bridging conformations&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The featured paper by Tim Levine (UCL, United Kingdom) predicts the existence of multiple bacterial homologues of the two LTPs folds known to form “groovy” LTPs inside eukaryotic cells. One fold is the &lt;u&gt;tu&lt;/u&gt;bular &lt;u&gt;lip&lt;/u&gt;id binding (TULIP) superfamily, which have quite short hydrophobic grooves (up to 7 nm long) – too short to stretch all the way between two membranes where they contact one another. The other “groovy” fold is the Chorein-N domain found at the N-terminus of various proteins including the human protein chorein. The first description of this protein as a half-pipe in 2018 revolutionised thinking about lipid transfer. Chorein has the internal capacity to hold many lipids (&amp;gt;20), forms rods 20 nm long, and is localised to sites where two membranes come very close together. The featured paper shows that domains that are strongly homologous either to TULIPs or Chorein-N (and in some cases both) are widespread in bacteria (Figure 3). In addition, there are previously unknown homologues in mitochondria, presumably inherited from the bacterial ancestor of these symbiotic organelles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prediction of likely bacterial homologues of these LTPs points to what experiments should be done next to investigate modes of “groovy” lipid transfer in bacteria, the most simple and tractable cellular system. This can bring us a lot closer to working out how lipids reach their destinations in all cells.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/OS-blog_Nov-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog is part of our series on the Future of Open Science. Read previous posts &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/category/future-of-open-series/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Open Access has provided us the opportunity—and the responsibility—to think about how scientific inquiry and discoveries are presented to a broader community. So how can we ensure credibility in research communication &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;assessment? One answer to that is preregistration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Preregistration enables authors to deposit their hypothesis and study design or submit it for peer review at a journal before they begin conducting experiments. Why is that important? Earlier documentation and review can help address two persistent scientific problems: increasing the credibility of results and reducing the amount of time it takes to make scientific knowledge available. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More Complete Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Scientific discovery often begins with a question. Researchers then design a study that will test this hypothesis and ultimately inform the work of future researchers. But that work is not evaluated until the experiment is complete. Staging peer review at the end of research cycle puts a lot of focus on the results, and introduces the potential for bias.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Whether it’s the publisher’s inclination to give surprising results more consideration, the reviewers’ tendency to give more credence to results that support their own views, or the author’s inclination to highlight positive results and leave out null or negative outcomes; focusing on results can leave a lot of excellent research and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5696751/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;hard-earned knowledge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; on the cutting room floor. In so doing, we forget the aim of science is to investigate and ultimately add to our understanding of a subject—whether or not the outcome is what we expected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;By documenting this initial phase of research and opening it up to peer review, researchers get earlier feedback and the opportunity to collaboratively craft the best study design possible before conducting their experiments. By depositing or publishing this initial work, researchers are committing to follow a certain approach and ensuring that the final article—whatever the outcome may be—will be evaluated for its thoroughness and rigor. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Less Time to Publish&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Science is happening everyday, but we don’t have access to that knowledge until the work is complete. Scientific investigation is often under-way for years before researchers are able to write up their findings and submit a research article to a journal for peer review. That can take some time too. Between review, revision, and the possibility of submitting to multiple journals before your work finds the right home, it can take several additional months for that work to publish. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Not only does earlier assessment through preregistration make sense for producing the best science, it can also reduce the amount of time from completion to publication. Authors who receive a provisional acceptance at a journal based on their hypothesis and approach won’t need to shop their final article around to multiple publishers in order to find the right fit for their work, streamlining the submission and publication process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Increasing Trust in Science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Even if you’re not a scientist, preregistration has its benefits. As readers, policymakers, and professionals who rely on scientific research, preregistration provides an extra assurance of the credibility of the results. By counteracting implicit biases in the review process and encouraging authors and publishers to present more complete findings, we also get access to an unfiltered scientific record. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Preregistration is still in its early days, but it’s something we’ve been thinking about a lot at PLOS, and you can expect to hear more updates from us soon. Until then, stay tuned for next month’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/category/future-of-open-series/&quot;&gt;Open Science&lt;/a&gt; post where we look at how Open helps increase reproducibility. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rhi_willmot?lang=en&quot;&gt;Rhi Willmot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is your mental library a haven of accurate and well-informed facts, or are there mistruths hiding on the shelves? It’s natural to assume that we update our beliefs in line with the most recent and well-established evidence. But what really happens to our views when a celebrity endorses a product that becomes discredited by science, or when a newspaper publishes a story which is later retracted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcpy.1135?casa_token=vTrfj0IhcAQAAAAA%3AZszrlG9yF_KC10vGTmS2AQ6A3WzOUtRQDDD7Fs77OQu6J0TN12DqpLDH5Pf6tnDhA-wjT-fkMqziQSl5AA&quot;&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/em&gt; presents a novel take on this topic, by investigating the &lt;em&gt;continued influence effect. &lt;/em&gt;Anne Hamby and colleagues suggest that our likelihood of continuing to believe retracted information depends on whether or not it helps us to understand the cause-and-effect structure of an event. Crucially, the team proposes, we would rather have a complete understanding of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; things happen than a perspective which is more accurate, but less complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38462&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first study, participants read a scenario in which an unwell character takes medication that fails to cure him. Whilst one group was informed the drug was ineffective because the character took it at the wrong time, the other group was given no explanation. Both groups were told the character took the medication with a glass of lemonade, and were then informed the drug is ineffective if consumed with citrus-based drinks. Later, all participants were notified that this last fact was untrue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day later, participants were asked to recall why the drug had been ineffective. Those who received no explanation for the drug failure in the original anecdote were more likely to incorrectly reference the lemonade drink as the reason why the medication didn’t work — even though most remembered that this information had later been retracted. This suggests information we later discover to be false is harder to ignore when it fills an explanatory “gap” in a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea was further supported by a second study, in which participants read the following extract from a successful poker player: “I reach down and pull out my bottle of kombucha which I like to drink at poker matches. I take a long deep swig from the bottle. And I have clarity of mind. I fold.” One group of participants was informed kombucha supports mental performance whilst another group was told the drink increases muscular function. This allowed those in the mental performance group to infer a link between kombucha drinking and poker success, whereas the muscular performance group could not. Later, all individuals were told the link between kombucha and mental performance or muscular function was untrue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants who read that kombucha was related to mental performance were more likely to recall the false information as true, and more likely to attribute it to the poker player’s win. When offered a selection of beverages to drink after the experiment, this group was also more likely to select kombucha. Again, it seems that when information supports our understanding of a story’s cause-and-effect structure, it is particularly “sticky”, even when we are told it isn’t true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a final study, the team repeated the original failed-medication scenario, but gave half the sample a positive ending to the story, in which the patient changes other aspects of his routine and improves. The other half were given a negative ending, in which the patient is unable to receive further treatment and does not get better. The researchers found the retracted information about citrus drinks had less of a continued influence on those who read the negative ending. They suggest this is because we are more motivated to accurately understand what leads to negative outcomes, as this will help us survive similar experiences in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a whole, it seems we have a general bias toward creating a complete mental picture of an event, rather than one that is factually accurate but lacking a cause-and-effect explanation. However, Hamby and colleagues also indicate this bias can be overcome when we recognise that prioritising accuracy over completeness will help us in future, or when a retraction offers an alternative explanation for the cause-and-effect structure of an event. Research such as this therefore makes us more aware of the chinks in our mental armour — and better equipped to defend them.&lt;/p&gt;

 In May of this year, François-Xavier Coudert, a chemist at PSL University in Paris, had a question about a paper in Chemistry: A European Journal. Several days later, he had an answer — sort of — along with an apology for readers from Haymo Ross, the journal’s editor in chief. It turns out that there … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2019/11/12/after-ten-years-of-being-in-limbo-a-chemistry-paper-is-retracted/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;After ten years of being in limbo, a chemistry paper is retracted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

The health reporter at &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/smell-dating-4/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt; wrote about the underlying science in detail (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;major histocompatibility complex&lt;/a&gt;) and interviewed smell scientists, including Dr. Noam Sobel (founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smellspace.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SmellSpace.com&lt;/a&gt;), Dr. Richard Doty (author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/great-pheromone-myth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Great Pheromone Myth&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and Dr. Gary Beauchamp (Emeritus Director of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.monell.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Monell Chemical Senses Center&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creators of Smell Dating (&lt;a href=&quot;http://tegabrain.com/Smell-Dating&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tega Brain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://lav.io/projects/smell-dating/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sam Levine&lt;/a&gt;) consulted with olfactory scientists and provided an extensive reading list on the web site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most everyone agrees that  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3794443/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;odors evoke emotion&lt;/a&gt;, and the sense of smell has a unique relationship to &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13423-018-1545-3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;autobiographical memory&lt;/a&gt;. But, as Richard Doty asks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK200980/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;do human pheromones exist?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;While it is apparent that, like music and lighting, odors and fragrances  can alter mood states and physiological arousal, is there evidence that  unique agents exist, namely pheromones, which specifically alter such  states?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that scientific opinion on this matter is decidedly mixed, even polarizing, as I'll discuss in the next post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reference&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doty RL.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You wouldn’t like me when I’m angry”: for the more mild-mannered among us, Bruce Banner’s famous catchphrase may not resonate. But add some hunger — “you wouldn’t like me when I’m &lt;em&gt;hangry”&lt;/em&gt; — and many of us can start to relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being hungry, whilst a daily occurrence, can have multiple negative psychological impacts. For one, and most obviously, it simply doesn’t feel good, often leading us to the aforementioned rattiness of “hanger”. But acute hunger has also been &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.44.3.513&quot;&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to an increase in self-interest and a decrease in helping behaviour, too. If your resources are low, the theory goes, you’re much less likely to cooperate with others as you want to keep food for yourself and are unwilling to expend valuable resources like time and energy on helping others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t always the case — at least not according to a new piece of research from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12579-7&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt; Communications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The team argues that acute hunger doesn’t always have an impact on prosociality, even though people strongly believe it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38443&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Together with their colleagues, Jan Häusser and Christina Stahlecker from Justus-Liebig-University Gießen conducted four studies to examine the phenomenon. In the first, acute hunger was experimentally manipulated, with participants instructed not to eat anything after 10pm the previous night. Those in the control condition were given food before completing tasks, whilst those in the hunger condition were not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants completed the Public Goods Game, a task which sees players deciding whether or not to contribute money to a shared pool. A prosocial response would be the contribution of everything to the shared pot to maximise resources. But those who don’t behave in a prosocial way would also profit, receiving both contributions from the shared pot and their own resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite the first group’s hunger, they didn’t significantly differ in their contributions compared to the control group. This was even true in a second study, where sessions were scheduled later to make participants even hungrier, and control participants given a higher level of sugar before completing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third and fourth studies, students were recruited in front of a cafe before and after lunch, and had levels of prosociality measured through several tasks. These included a request to participate in a future, follow-up study — for absolutely no financial compensation. And again, the team found that hunger did not predict participants’ levels of prosociality: 45% of hungry participants agreed to volunteer for this future study compared to 47% of sated participants. Another task showed that these participants were &lt;span&gt;also&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;just as willing to share money with a partner as the non-hungry participants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite these findings, our beliefs about what happens when we need food are somewhat different. In an online survey, the team found that people &lt;em&gt;expected&lt;/em&gt; hungry people to be more selfish, less helpful and less cooperative. They also believed the same of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why the disparity? The team suggests such beliefs are grounded in the “widespread myth of self-interest” — the idea that people are essentially and inherently selfish. If we ascribe to this belief, of course it makes sense that we think people would shed all prosociality when times get tough: underneath the surface, after all, we care about ourselves more than anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, as the team points out, only apply to hunger “within the upper boundaries of the natural daily fluctuation typical in Western industrialized societies” — in other words, the results may not be relevant when considering the sort of existential hunger that many experience through poverty, war or natural disasters. The cafe studies also depended on subjective measurements of hunger, making it difficult to tell exactly how hungry participants were and therefore how this may affect their behaviour and choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the idea that people are not inherently selfish — even when going through unpleasant or uncomfortable experiences — may be a valuable takeaway. And as we continue to experience political and environmental turmoil, it may be a lesson we sorely need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12579-7&quot;&gt;Acute hunger does not always undermine prosociality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 On Twitter this week I joked that neuroscientists could save money on brain scanners by just asking people how active their brains are.







Why do we spend so much on neuroimaging and then rely on self-report measures of the other variables of interest? Why not self-report brain activity, how active is your amygdala 1-10? https://t.co/ph3A2Uc6zc— Neuroskeptic (@Neuro_Skeptic) November 6, 2019

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/drugs-2793133-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who inject drugs face many health challenges. Aside from the highly publicized overdose epidemic, people who inject drugs are at risk for several infectious diseases due to the unsterile nature of injecting drugs. These infections range from hepatitis C and HIV to bacterial and fungal infections. Some infections are limited to the skin, like abscesses. Other more serious infections occur when bacteria or fungus penetrate deeper into the blood stream. When these infections get into the blood stream, they have the potential to infect bones, the central nervous system or the heart, among many other sites. When the heart is infected, the heart valves are the main sites that become affected. This condition we term infective endocarditis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infective endocarditis is a serious condition with a high likelihood of death or other complications. Examples of these complications include heart failure or embolism – clots that break off the valve and block blood vessels. These clots can block blood vessels in organs such as the kidneys, lungs or brain, leading to death of a part of that organ. The mainstay of treatment are antibiotics and under certain conditions some patients may need surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We estimated that people who inject drugs were 47% more likely to die than people who do not inject drugs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the recent increase in the United States and elsewhere of injection drug use and, consequently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2717121/drug-associated-infective-endocarditis-trends-what-s-all-buzz-about&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;infective endocarditis&lt;/a&gt;, a debate has unfurled in the mainstream and academic literature investigating what to do when people who inject drugs need surgery for infective endocarditis. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/29/health/drugs-opioids-addiction-heart-endocarditis.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;public debate&lt;/a&gt; echoes the concerns doctors and surgeons face on a day-to-day basis when dealing with these cases. Health care providers attempt to improve health and therefore try to do everything possible for all patients, however, the recidivism of drug use poses some unique challenges to surgical intervention, even when otherwise medically indicated in this specific set of circumstances. Some providers have chosen to defer or deny surgery even when indicated, although others have proposed strategies that include signed-contracts agreeing to abstinence, multidisciplinary-team treatment approaches, and even a “three-strike rule.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11420 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;199&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/heart-2607178-300x199.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many studies from diverse medical centers around the world have provided some evidence of the risks of death and reinfection after surgery in people who inject drugs. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/69/7/1120/5257358?searchresult=1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; summarized many of these studies in a systematic review and meta-analysis. The authors reported that people who inject drugs have a similar risk of death compared to people who do not inject drugs at 30 days after cardiac surgery for infective endocarditis. In this type of study – meta-analyses – the published results of many studies are pooled using different statistical techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our objective was to estimate the risk of death and re-operation of people who inject drugs after cardiac surgery for infective endocarditis over a longer period of time. We also performed a systematic review and meta-analysis but extended our analysis to 5 and 10 years. We estimated that people who inject drugs were 47% more likely to die than people who do not inject drugs. We also estimated that people who inject drugs were more than twice as likely to require re-operation over the studied time period. Based on these estimates, at 5 years, people who inject drugs had a 62% chance of being alive compared to a 70% chance in people who do not inject drugs. Further, the average age of people who inject drugs in the included studies was 35 years compared to 51 years in people who do no inject drugs. This is concerning as people who inject drugs were younger, and hence, are less likely to suffer from other chronic diseases, they were still more likely to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;people who inject drugs were more than twice as likely to require re-operation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot know from the included studies why people who inject drugs were more likely to die or have a re-operation. We do have a major thought as to why and how to prevent it. Traditionally, people who inject drugs rarely receive treatment for their substance use disorders at acute care hospitals. Treatments like methadone, buprenorphine or long-acting naltrexone, exist and have been proven to be effective. The hospital visit is a lost moment when treatment for substance use could be provided but was not. Without treatment for the underlying substance use disorder, people who inject drugs are likely to continue injecting drugs after being discharged from the hospital, in turn, increasing their chance of reinfection and death. The source of the infection has not been addressed. We need to offer treatment to every patient with a substance use disorder at every chance we get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we provide evidence that people who inject drugs have worse outcomes after cardiac surgery than people who do not inject drugs. Although our data cannot answer the question of whether people who inject drugs should get surgery or not, we do know that interventions are urgently needed to bridge the gap in outcomes after cardiac surgery between people who do and do not inject drugs. Every effort should be made to provide evidence-based therapy for substance use disorders to people with these disorders when engaging medical settings. With the ever-increasing number of people who inject drugs engaging with our medical centers we should be ready to provide these treatments, and further develop strategies to improve on these treatments. This would save the lives of many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting kids to sit still during brain scans is notoriously difficult — but now researchers have developed an MEG scanner that is essentially a modified bike helmet. &lt;/strong&gt;The device could make it easier to measure brain activity in young children, as well as scan older participants as they perform activities they wouldn’t be able to do in a standard MEG scanner, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2019/11/05/to-help-fidgety-kids-researchers-made-a-brain-scanner-that-fits-in-a-bike-helmet/#.XcUgWTP7SUl&quot;&gt;writes Jennifer Walter at &lt;em&gt;Discover Magazine’s&lt;/em&gt; “D-Brief” blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38421&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some women apparently lack part of the brain that is key for processing odour, yet are still able to smell&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-women-who-lack-olfactory-bulbs-can-still-sense-smell&quot;&gt;Sofie Bates reports at &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers estimate that around 4% of left-handed women are missing the brain’s olfactory bulbs, &lt;span&gt;based on MRI scans that show no sign of the structures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The fact these people can still smell suggests that other areas of the brain may be able to compensate for the absence of olfactory bulbs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Animal owners may believe that ineffective treatments work on their pets because of a phenomenon known as the “caregiver placebo effect”&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/11/danger-pet-placebo/601489/?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;writes Emily Anthes at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; After giving a sick pet &lt;span&gt;medication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, people may be more likely to interpret ambiguous symptoms in a more positive way, for instance. Unfortunately, that can result in owners believing that their pets are responding to ineffective alternative therapies, and leave them blind to the continued suffering of their pets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a 1973 study, David Rosenham and seven other healthy volunteers pretended to be patients and got themselves admitted at psychiatric hospitals in the United States.&lt;/strong&gt; The experiment revealed the poor conditions of psychiatric care and the supposed unreliability of psychiatric diagnoses, and &lt;span&gt;has&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/20/textbook-fail-rosenhans-classic-on-being-sane-in-insane-places-covered-without-criticism/&quot;&gt;become a staple of psychology textbooks.&lt;/a&gt; But&lt;span&gt; in her new book “The Great Pretender”, Susannah Cahalan is left wondering whether the study really occurred as Rosenham claimed. Cahalan &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/11/02/stanford-professor-who-changed-america-with-just-one-study-was-also-a-liar/&quot;&gt;recounts her investigation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in an article at the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, while Alison Abbott &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03268-y&quot;&gt;reviews the book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychedelic drugs are receiving increased attention for their potential to treat depression and other mental health conditions&lt;/strong&gt;. But is the experience of a “trip” necessary for the effects of these drugs — or do they influence well-being through some other means? At &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa748k/psilocybin-for-depression-and-the-world-of-non-hallucinogenic-psychedelics&quot;&gt;Shayla Love talks to the researchers&lt;/a&gt; trying to untangle the mechanisms behind the drugs’ apparent clinical effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, we recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/08/29/further-evidence-that-acting-like-an-extravert-can-boost-wellbeing/&quot;&gt;reported on a new study&lt;/a&gt; suggesting (with some caveats) that acting like an extravert can boost well-being.&lt;/strong&gt; Now, over at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, introvert Sirin Kale &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/nov/07/faking-it-could-i-go-from-being-an-introvert-to-an-extrovert-in-one-week-&quot;&gt;performs an &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 1 replication&lt;/a&gt; of the study, going out of her comfort zone to spend an extraverted week attending gardening and walking groups, a dodgeball game and a Halloween party full of strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compiled by Matthew Warren (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@MattbWarren&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), Editor of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/&quot;&gt;BPS Research Digest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Break-ups are always hard, with love and companionship giving way to feelings of resentment and the souring of once treasured memories. Yet people often continue to harbour positive feelings towards their exes long after the relationship is over. And that may be particularly the case if you’re a man, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550619876633&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers have found that, in heterosexual relationships at least, men tend to view their exes more positively than do women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38408&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ursula Athenstaedt from the University of Graz and colleagues first discovered the effect when conducting research into whether people’s attitudes towards their exes could be altered. Across two studies, a total of almost 300 heterosexual participants completed a questionnaire about their attitudes towards their former partners, rating their agreement with 18 statements like “When I think about my ex-partner I get angry” and “My ex-partner has many positive traits”. The researchers’ experimental manipulation turned out to have no effect on these ratings — but instead they found that, overall, men tended to have slightly more positive attitudes towards their exes than women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team decided to further explore the finding in a third study. They gave the same attitude questionnaire to 612 new participants, all of whom had had a previous heterosexual relationship lasting at least 4 months; some were now in a new relationship while others were single. The participants also completed several other scales, such as rating the degree of social support they had received from their ex-partner, how much they used coping strategies like self-distraction or venting following their break-up, the reasons for breaking up, and their attitudes towards sex and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men again had more positive attitudes towards their exes than women, with an average score on the questionnaire of 3.57 (out of 5) compared to the women’s average of 3.11. But men and women also differed on several of the other measures as well. Men had a more “permissive” attitude towards sex (they were more likely to agree with statements like “I do not need to be committed to a person to have sex with her”), for example, and had received more social support from their exes than had women. On the other hand, women had used more coping strategies following their break-ups, and were more likely to say that their partner was the cause of the split. A subsequent analysis showed that these various factors could partly — but not completely — account for the differences between men and women in their attitudes towards exes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that the findings may stem from a combination of evolutionary and social factors. Men’s permissive sexual attitudes might make them &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/08/the-reasons-we-stay-friends-with-an-ex/&quot;&gt;more eager to keep open the possibility of sex with former partners&lt;/a&gt;, for instance — and so it makes sense to maintain a more positive attitude towards them. Similarly, men may hold a rosier view of their exes because they were a greater source of emotional support, whereas women tended to receive less support from their partners and more from other sources like friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whether these theories hold up remains to be seen. “While our studies document this stable gender difference, we do not know its specific origins. Even though both evolutionary and gender role theories provide some valuable insights, additional research is needed to pin down the key origins,” the authors acknowledge. And it’s also unclear how far the results generalise. Most notably, the study only included heterosexual participants, so doesn’t reveal much about the attitudes of men and women who are gay or bisexual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, having a more positive view of your ex may actually have a detrimental effect on subsequent romantic partnerships, the team suggests — so men’s new relationships may be particularly prone to difficulties. In other words, being grateful for your ex may actually make it harder to say “thank you, next”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550619876633&quot;&gt;Men View Their Ex-Partners More Favorably Than Women Do&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/featured2-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it important to include participants as partners? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal population-based cohort studies that assess health-related exposure outcomes can provide important knowledge about the needs of older adults, and are &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-842X.2006.tb00849.x&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;critical to our understanding&lt;/a&gt; of the aging process. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/hex.12158&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Listening to the voice of research participants&lt;/a&gt; is not new in ageing research. It is, however, important to distinguish between older adults as the subjects of research and older adults as &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40520-017-0750-7&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;partners in the research process&lt;/a&gt;. While issues of engagement can be similar, the relationship is quite different – involving older adults in decisions about the research process is about a shift in power – it is about building partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, we know relatively little about the priorities of older adults and the possible problems they experience when they participate in longitudinal population-based studies. Therefore, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1238-4?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our study&lt;/a&gt; aimed to explore older adults’ motives, understandings and experiences regarding participating in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10654-018-0459-8&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Studies&lt;/a&gt; (the H70 study) – multidisciplinary epidemiological studies examining representative birth cohorts of older populations in Gothenburg, Sweden, since 1971.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did we perform the study? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty-eight 70-year-old participants from the H70 study participated in nine &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9566.ep11347023&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;focus groups&lt;/a&gt; to discuss what made them agree to participate in the study and their experiences of the health examinations and questions, the self-report assessments they were asked to fill out, and the information that they had received prior to, during, and after the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, it was worth it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the H70 study was experienced on the one hand as intense, exhausting, and never-ending, and on the other hand as interesting, rewarding, challenging and beneficial – both for oneself and for others. Although the participants had critical opinions about the study as a whole, the results showed that they trusted the purpose of the study and the intentions of the researchers responsible for it. Research shows that &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11406-009-9218-0&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trust&lt;/a&gt; is considered an essential prerequisite for &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1525/jer.2008.3.4.35&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;involvement in health research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s new?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11400&quot; style=&quot;width: 303px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/fig1a-293x300.png&quot; width=&quot;293&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;from Dahlin-Ivanoff et al.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the focus groups, taking part in the H70 study was motivated by a perception that it would grant the participants access to thorough and systematic health examinations that they otherwise would not have access to due to their advanced age and seemingly ageist priorities in the Swedish healthcare system. If participation in research is a way to gain access to treatment, we must be concerned about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6939-14-40&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;context in which decisions on research participation are made&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the consequences this will have for research participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants also experienced limited control over the examinations, feeling that the information that they were given was insufficient, and that the purpose of various tests was hard to understand. This resulted in participants still having unanswered questions even while participating in the study. The H70 study is a complex environment that poses major challenges for participants’ ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0951484816639741&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;understand and use health information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some questions were also considered sensitive and difficult to answer. For example, the participants perceived certain questions as ageist, stereotyping and attributing certain characteristics to older adults based on their age. Other questions were perceived as heteronormative and discriminatory against all participants with other forms of sexuality and gender roles. However, our results also showed that if the participants felt safe and confident in the meeting with the person conducting the examinations, they did not find it difficult to be open and truthful when answering sensitive questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical implications &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study has provided us with knowledge concerning a number of problems that we have to consider in future follow-up examinations in the H70 study in order to ensure the quality of longitudinal studies of older adults. By including older adults as collaborators in research, their autonomy and self-determination can increase, as well as their ability to act on their own authority. For us as researchers, listening effectively to the experience and knowledge of older adults may lead to innovative lines of research, provide insight, and ensure that the research questions addressed are those that will benefit older adults the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to succeed with increased user involvement at all stages of the research process, we need to create supportive research environments with well-trained research staff that have access to the educational tools needed in order to secure the quality of the results the H70 study. This also includes development of tools needed to meet the needs of those older adults with lower health literacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many of us, saying thank you is a simple fact of life: someone does a nice thing, you express your gratitude. A lack of thanks when you feel it is due can certainly leave you feeling irritated, but on the whole we rarely think about the practice beyond the fact that it’s both considered polite and that it feels good to thank or be thanked. Indeed, much &lt;a href=&quot;https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/pdfs/GratitudePDFs/2Wood-GratitudeWell-BeingReview.pdf&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that expressing gratitude can lead to increased well-being and positive affect, including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-08033-003&quot;&gt;rise in happiness&lt;/a&gt;, and increased ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735810000413?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;recognise and adapt to various situational demands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But could giving thanks actually reinforce unequal power dynamics? The authors of a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167219879125&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin &lt;/em&gt;think so. They argue that expressing gratitude towards higher power groups can result in low-power groups ending up “pacified” and discouraged from advocating for their own interests, making saying “thank you” more problematic than we may have first assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38395&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inna Ksenofontov and Julia Becker from the University of Osnabrück designed several studies to test this hypothesis. In the first, participants were assigned to a low-power position as an “employee”. They were then asked to collaborate with another employee and a manager through computerised tasks, the completion of which would enter them into a prize draw. But the manager behaved unfairly, assigning himself easy tasks and giving employees those that were difficult or impossible to complete — meaning he kept the lottery tickets for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the first set, the manager contacted the participants and offered to give them easier tasks in the next round. Participants in the experimental condition were given three response options, all expressing thanks (e.g. “thank you very much”); control participants were given neutral options (e.g. “I have read the message”). Participants then indicated how willing they would be to protest against the manager’s actions on the employees’ behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who had to express thanks were less likely to confront their manager than those given neutral options, suggesting that the act of saying thank you had, in effect, pacified them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These participants were either forced to give, or not give, thanks — but what about when they had a clear choice to say thank you? In the second study, &lt;em&gt;voluntary &lt;/em&gt;expressions of thanks to high-power groups were measured, again to test whether they were negatively associated with intention to protest. In an online study, 125 participants were asked to imagine themselves interacting with a professor who had transgressed (by advising them to make changes to an assignment, but then grading them lower than expected) but then helped (by eventually giving them a higher score). They were then asked whether they would thank the professor or simply leave the classroom, and whether they would forgive the professor or admonish him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that 33.6% of participants said they would thank the professor, and again an analysis showed those who thanked him were less likely to complain about the professor’s behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the final studies, conducted online and in the lab, scenarios were created in which female participants had to decide whether or not to thank a high-power colleague who behaved in a sexist way, and indicate how likely they were to complain about this behaviour. Again, researchers found that expressing thanks motivated forgiveness, which in turn undermined intent to protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means, the team argues, is that expressing thanks can have a pacifying effect in situations defined by social injustice or inequality: by saying thank you, members of the lower-power group essentially “forgive” the high-power person and end up less willing to protest. This can be particularly striking in issues of human rights — the authors use the example of immigrants resisting demands to be “grateful” for citizenship, believing that doing so puts them at the mercy of higher power groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research does have some limitations — the researchers didn’t look at what happens when low-power groups &lt;em&gt;receive&lt;/em&gt; gratitude from high-power groups, nor did they analyse exactly &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; a person might thank someone in a position of power. As the team acknowledges, disadvantaged groups may use expressions of gratitude in attempts to advance their own status within a power hierarchy, so saying “thanks” may not always reflect a passive acceptance of the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this study does make clear is that even those social interactions we take for granted can have different meanings and implications in different contexts. None of this is to say that we should stop saying thank you to each other — after all, it’s an important social tool. But thinking a little more carefully about what it means, particularly for disadvantaged groups, could prove to be more useful than you might first assume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167219879125&quot;&gt;The Harmful Side of Thanks: Thankful Responses to High-Power Group Help Undermine Low-Power Groups’ Protest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This means &lt;strong&gt;“Doctor, I’m not dumb”&lt;/strong&gt; She went on to describe how she feels the sting of discrimination for not speaking English and how she dedicates her time trying to navigate her way through life, even just to find a doctor, like myself, who can speak in her own language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language skills specific to the patient-doctor encounter are critical for those who engage in clinical medicine around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we, the authors, were superheroes and could choose to have any power, we would choose omnilingualism – the ability to communicate seamlessly across languages and cultural contexts. The United States, like many other countries, is becoming increasingly diverse with immigrants from all over the world finding a new home here. As physicians, we meet patients from all walks of life who speak different languages. Listening to their journeys is one of the most inspirational parts of our work and communicating directly with linguistically diverse patients is important for building rapport and cultivating trust in the patient-doctor relationship and the broader health system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-019-1807-4&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Debate&lt;/a&gt;, published this month in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BMC Medical Education&lt;/a&gt;, we argue for medical schools to increase opportunities for medical language courses and integrate them into the curriculum with evidence-based teaching strategies, content about health equity, and standardized language assessments. Language skills specific to the patient-doctor encounter are critical for physicians who practice in the United States and for those who engage in clinical medicine around the world. Given the unprecedented interest in global health work among medical students, it is time to professionalize language preparedness as part of global health education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;To achieve our mission, we are actively working to integrate cultural humility and health equity into our curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many other medical schools, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hms.harvard.edu/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt; (HMS) offers non-English language training as part of the undergraduate medical curriculum. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://meded.hms.harvard.edu/medical-languages&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Medical Language Program&lt;/a&gt; includes elective language courses in beginner, intermediate, and advanced Spanish, Portuguese, and Mandarin. We also offer opportunities for students to do electives in other countries to solidify their language skills in addition to their clinical skills. The first medical Spanish course was started in the 1970s, and there are over 1000 alumni who have taken a language elective at HMS since then. Our mission is to promote awareness of and skills to address language barriers to achieving health equity by equipping medical students with language skills to provide language-concordant and culturally-humble care for diverse patient populations. To achieve our mission, we are actively working to integrate cultural humility and health equity into our curriculum. In addition, we are working toward standardizing assessments of language competency suitable for clinical encounters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope our Debate sparks discussions among leaders in medical schools about the importance of language instruction as part of undergraduate medical education.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Muhammad Yaqoob will talk about the paper &quot;Towards Explainable Artificial Intelligence&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, machine learning (ML) has become a key enabling
technology for the sciences and industry. Especially through
improvements in methodology, the availability of large databases
and increased computational power, today's ML algorithms are able
to achieve excellent performance (at times even exceeding the
human level) on an increasing number of complex tasks. Deep
learning models are at the forefront of this development. However,
due to their nested non-linear structure, these powerful models
have been generally considered &quot;black boxes&quot;,  not providing
any information about what exactly makes them arrive at their
predictions. Since in many applications, e.g., in the medical
domain, such lack of transparency may be not acceptable, the
development of methods for visualizing, explaining and
interpreting deep learning models has recently attracted
increasing attention. This introductory paper presents recent
developments and applications in this field and makes a plea
for a wider use of explainable learning algorithms in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Researchers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/10/trends-in-preprints/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;have told us&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; that posting manuscripts as preprints before—or at the same time as—submitting them to a journal is a great way to gain additional feedback from the community and improve their paper. Could the same community feedback also help improve the quality and speed of the review process at a journal? We’re launching a pilot to find out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Preprints are a valuable collaborative tool. They allow researchers to share their work earlier and more broadly, opening opportunities for the community to provide constructive comments before the work is formally published in a journal. However, the vast majority of preprint feedback is delivered in private communications to the authors, and this input is therefore happening independently from the journal peer review process. We want to change that by encouraging public community comments on preprints and exploring how they can complement formal peer review to help authors and editors develop articles more efficiently. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As part of our&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/05/power-to-the-preprint/&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;longstanding partnership&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), authors can opt-in to having PLOS post a preprint version of their manuscript to bioRxiv when they submit (nearly 4,000 preprints have been posted using this service!) Now, we’ve worked with CSHL to be alerted to the comments on those preprints posted by PLOS while they are under consideration at our journals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Starting today, PLOS staff will be checking comments left on preprinted submissions to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/&quot;&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/&quot;&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ntds/&quot;&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/pathogens/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; using the PLOS preprint posting service. Those comments that could be relevant to the scientific evaluation of the manuscript will be made available to the editor handling the peer review of the manuscript at PLOS. At the discretion of the handling editor, useful comments can then complement the peer reviews that they have commissioned. As they are communicated to authors by the editor, these comments can then become part of the published peer review history for the article upon publication—making the entire review process completely transparent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We hope this trial will provide greater opportunities for research communities to participate in reviews of preprints, while promoting transparency in peer review in general. We will be checking in with authors and editors to learn more about their experiences during this pilot, and look forward to sharing the results with you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of us crumble in the face of adversity, and struggle to recover, others quickly bounce back from even serious trauma. Psychological resilience is undeniably important in all kinds of areas of life, so understanding what underpins it, and how to train it – particularly in children — is of intense interest to psychologists.&lt;span id=&quot;more-38384&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Watch your language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Carol Dweck of growth mindset fame, to drive success in our children we should “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/12/how-praise-became-a-consolation-prize/510845/&quot;&gt;praise the effort that led to the outcome or learning progress; tie the praise to it&lt;/a&gt;,” as opposed to praising effort more broadly, or achievement alone. Research led by Victoria Sisk and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797617739704&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt; did challenge the idea that encouraging children to have a growth mindset (to believe that effort affects attributes like intelligence) increases academic achievement. However, there are certainly studies finding that focusing on a child’s actions, rather than who they “are”, helps them to withstand setbacks. As Emily Foster-Hanson and her fellow researchers at New York University note in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.13147&quot;&gt;study also published last year&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;em&gt;Child Development&lt;/em&gt;: “Setbacks and difficulties are common features of children’s experience throughout development and into adulthood,” so it’s important to examine the effects of category labelling — like “being smart” or “being a helper”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team’s study of four- and five-year-old visitors to the Children’s Museum of Manhattan found that setbacks were more detrimental to a child labelled “a helper” than a child asked “to help”. Children asked “to help” with tasks in which they were set up to fail (by being asked to put away a toy truck that fell apart as soon as they picked it up, for example) were more likely to go on to volunteer to help with other demanding situations. In contrast, the “helper” kids tended to avoid these and opt instead for low-effort tasks with a high chance of success, like putting away some crayons. Perhaps these kids were taking advantage of a quick, virtually-guaranteed way to restore a little of their dented “helper” image — one they weren’t about to risk even further by going for a challenging task. So, if you do want your kids to weather inevitable setbacks, resist asking them to “be” anything, like “my helper”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Engage in “strength-based parenting”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Strength-based parenting” entails deliberately identifying and cultivating positive states, processes and qualities in a child, explains Lea Waters at the University of Melbourne, Australia. “This style of parenting adds a ‘positive filter’ to the way a child reacts to stress. It also limits the likelihood of children using avoidance or aggressive coping responses,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Waters and her colleagues published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scirp.org/html/4-6901461_56129.htm&quot;&gt;preliminary study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Psychology&lt;/em&gt; that explored strength-based coping in a group of Australian primary school-age children. The team presented the kids with a few theoretical stressful scenarios — falling out with a friend over turns on a swing, and being the only one in class who hadn’t done a homework project that was due in the next day — and asked them to describe how they would respond. The children who came up with “positive” responses (like taking deep breaths to help them to cope with the homework challenge, and reminding themselves of happy times with the friend, or “using their kindness” and deciding to let the other child have more turns on the swing), and who indicated that their parents were aware of their strengths, and encouraged them to use them, also experienced less stress themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Waters and her team reported that &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41042-017-0007-x&quot;&gt;training in strength-based parenting could help parents, too&lt;/a&gt;. Parents who were taught how to identify and cultivate strengths in themselves and their children went on to feel more positively about their children and reported greater confidence in their ability to raise them successfully. Then in 2019, the team reported a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-018-9983-1&quot;&gt;link between strength-based coping and enhanced academic perseverance&lt;/a&gt; in adolescents. This work suggests that a “strength-based” approach may help with resilience to setbacks at school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try a strength-based approach with a child, the team recommends consciously identifying and fostering their abilities, talents and skills, and encouraging them to use them when faced with difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Don’t shield them from stress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennis Charney, a biological psychiatrist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai, New York, has studied all kinds of people who’ve been through traumatic experiences — from being a prisoner of war to suffering assault, or natural disaster — and identified factors that explain why some people bounce back, while others don’t. (His 2012 book, &lt;em&gt;Resilience&lt;/em&gt;, jointly-authored with Steven Southwick at Yale University, explains the findings in full. There’s also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://icahn.mssm.edu/about/leadership/resilience&quot;&gt;podcast based on the book&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being the kind of person who embraces tough challenges, rather than trying to avoid them, emerged as a key factor. To develop this, Charney recommends giving kids challenges that they can just about manage, and once they have achieved them, raising the bar a little each time. With his own five kids, he’d take them on long hikes, for instance, and get them just a little lost. During one of these trips, he recalls, one of his daughters told him that “out of her soul, she despised me”. (Now an adult, she willingly goes off hiking herself). Exposing kids to controlled stressful experiences allows them to develop a “psychological toolkit” of coping methods to draw upon in adulthood too, Charney maintains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Teach self-regulation skills &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explicitly teaching kids ways to regulate their responses to adversity builds resilience, helping them to do well in school and in life. This is the message from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00612/full&quot;&gt;a 2017 study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, of 365 Spanish children and young adults, aged 15-21, all of whom struggled academically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In research conducted for her &lt;a href=&quot;http://dadun.unav.edu/bitstream/10171/36188/4/TesisRaquelArtuch.pdf&quot;&gt;2014 PhD thesis&lt;/a&gt;, Raquel Artuch-Garde at the International University of La Rioja found that self-regulation and resilience are key factors that can determine academic success or failure. For the more recent study, she and her colleagues gave the participants a resilience scale (which asked about their perceptions of support and their ability to tolerate negative situations) and a self-regulation questionnaire (which explored their ability to make and stick to goals and to persevere at a task). They found a clear relationship between scores on both. Participants who were better able to learn from mistakes — which was considered to be a crucial aspect of self-regulation — had a greater tolerance for negative situations; in other words, they demonstrated greater resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-regulation involves analysing and setting specific task-related goals, monitoring and evaluating your performance, managing your emotions throughout, and learning from whatever went wrong. The recent study suggests that teaching children these kinds of skills could help with resilience, too. “The research shows the relationship between two essential non-cognitive skills: resilience and self-regulation, that are equally or even more important than cognitive aspects in the educational process of students at risk of social exclusion,” Artuch-Garde says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Focus on “quantity time” and group activities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998, Iceland launched a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rannsoknir.is/en/ipm/&quot;&gt;national initiative&lt;/a&gt; with the aim of slashing alcohol and drug use among teens. But the way the programme was set up meant that &lt;a href=&quot;https://mosaicscience.com/story/iceland-prevent-teen-substance-abuse/&quot;&gt;it did not only this, but much more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through funded sport, art and music classes, teenagers were given alternative ways to feel good. Among new measures targeted at adults, parents were encouraged to spend more time with their kids (not just limited “quality time”) and to talk more to their children about their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National questionnaires showed a huge adoption of both these strategies between 1997 and 2012 — and during the same period, Iceland went from having some of the worst statistics for teen alcohol and drug use in Europe to having the best. “This is the most remarkably intense and profound study of stress in the lives of teenagers that I have ever seen,” commented US-based consultant Harvey Milkman, in 2017. “I’m just so impressed by how well it is working.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towns and municipalities in many other countries &lt;a href=&quot;https://planetyouth.org/&quot;&gt;have now adopted the model&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2019, Chile announced that it would roll out its own version of the Icelandic programme nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Icelandic initiative was not set up to “train resilience”, but in bringing families closer together and increasing access to sport and cultural activities, it is producing physically and psychologically healthier teenagers — kids who find it easier to resist drugs, and who should be better equipped to cope with challenges in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It couldn’t have happened, however, without the full backing of the government, local mayors, other public officials and schools. In other communities that are adopting the model, and that are seeing the benefits, local mayors and policy-makers have either instigated or come on board to drive similar programmes within their community. An individualistic focus on improving self-regulation, for example, in your own kids is one thing. But when everyone gets together to support all the teens within a community, or a country, the results can be remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;NeuroFedora logo&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://neuroblog.fedoraproject.org/images/NeuroFedoraLogo01.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 30%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/design/issue/602&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora logo by Terezahl from the Fedora Design Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have been busy working on our first deliverable so this post is a little
overdue. Since we now have quite a bit of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/compneuro-tools/&quot;&gt;software for computational
neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;
available to use in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt;, the obvious next step was to try and make
this even more easily available to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-31/&quot;&gt;Fedora 31&lt;/a&gt; based Comp Neuro ISO image is now ready, you can get it &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/install-media/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For more
information on what this contains, and how it is created, read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;fedora-community-deliverables&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fedora Community deliverables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fedora community generates a bunch of deliverables for users. The main
ones, of course, are the primary editions: the workstation, the server edition,
CoreOS, Silverblue, IoT. They can all be obtained from the community website at
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://getfedora.org&quot;&gt;https://getfedora.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these are ready to use and have gone through a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/31/Schedule&quot;&gt;thorough development
cycle&lt;/a&gt; that includes a
stringent &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA&quot;&gt;Quality Assurance (QA)&lt;/a&gt; cycle.
These are &quot;live&quot;, so they can either either be used directly off the ISO image
without having to install them, or they can be used to install a Fedora based
system. Them being &quot;live&quot; makes them a great tool for temporary work---grab an
ISO, start up a virtual machine, use Fedora to do your work, destroy the
virtual machine when done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these are the main deliverables, the Fedora community also generates
other media for our diverse user base. These are classified as &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://spins.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;Spins&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://labs.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;Labs&lt;/a&gt;. While the Workstation is based on the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gnome.org&quot;&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt; desktop environment, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://spins.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;Spins&lt;/a&gt;
provide Fedora users other desktop environment based images: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://kde.org/&quot;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://lxqt.org/&quot;&gt;LXQT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://xfce.org/&quot;&gt;XFCE&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://mate-desktop.org&quot;&gt;Mate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_(desktop_environment)&quot;&gt;Cinnamon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sugarlabs.org/&quot;&gt;Sugar on a stick (SAOS)&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://labs.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;Labs&lt;/a&gt; are similar, but instead of focussing on the desktop environment, they
include customised sets of software required for particular purposes:
Astronomy, Design, Python, Security, Robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;the-fedora-community-change-process&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Fedora Community Change Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We therefore, submitted a community change proposal to permit us to generate
another Fedora Lab image, one for computational neuroscience. You can read the
proposal &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Comp_Neuro_Lab&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/program_management/changes_policy/&quot;&gt;Changes process&lt;/a&gt;
allows community members to propose new changes to aid the community. Depending
on their scope, they can either be &quot;System wide&quot; or &quot;Self Contained&quot; changes.
The &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/Z4NKZUX3SJXOC6QAC72AOEYECSS4JSKT/&quot;&gt;community discussed our proposal&lt;/a&gt;,
and the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/&quot;&gt;FESCO&lt;/a&gt;) has &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/2237&quot;&gt;approved it&lt;/a&gt; as a change for the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/32/Schedule&quot;&gt;Fedora 32&lt;/a&gt; release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, from &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/32/Schedule&quot;&gt;Fedora 32&lt;/a&gt; onwards, a Comp Neuro Lab image will be generated by the
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.pagure.org/releng/&quot;&gt;Fedora Release Engineering Team&lt;/a&gt; as an
official Fedora community deliverable, and it will feature on the Fedora &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://labs.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;Labs&lt;/a&gt;
website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;fedora-31-comp-neuro-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fedora 31 Comp Neuro Image&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/32/Schedule&quot;&gt;Fedora 32&lt;/a&gt;, however, is still in the works. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-31/&quot;&gt;Fedora 31&lt;/a&gt; was only released
recently. Therefore, in the meantime, as a Beta test, the NeuroFedora team is
generating an ISO based on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-31/&quot;&gt;Fedora 31&lt;/a&gt; ourselves.  You can get it &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/install-media/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is based on the Fedora Workstation, which is an excellent &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gnome.org&quot;&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt; based
operating system for users. To the Fedora Workstation, we added a variety of
simulators and analysis tools that are used in computational neuroscience, such
as: auryn, bionetgen, calcium-calculator, COPASI, qalculate, getdp,
genesis-simulator, gnuplot, moose, nest, neuron, neurord, octave, paraview,
python3, brian2, ipython, nest, neuron, libNeuroML, neo, nineml, PyLEMS, and
smoldyn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also includes the complete Python Science stack: matplotlib, jupyter
notebook, numpy, pandas, pillow, scikit-image, scikit-learn, scipy,
statsmodels, and sympy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use these tools, please give it a go and see what you think. You can
contact us using one of our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/communicating/&quot;&gt;communication channels&lt;/a&gt; (also
linked in the top bar of this site). If you use a tool that is not included in
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; yet, you can also suggest it for inclusion using &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://goo.gl/forms/j6AJ82yOh78MPxby1&quot;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is volunteer driven initiative and contributions in any form always
welcome.  You can get in touch with us &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/overview/#_communicating_and_getting_help&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
We are happy to help you learn the skills needed to contribute to the project.
In fact, that is one of the major goals of the initiative---to spread technical
knowledge that is necessary to develop software for Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/how-to-nurture-a-healthy-brain-for-life-part-7-of-your-brain-at-100/"/>
		<id>http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/?p=6073</id>
		<updated>2019-11-05T05:11:13+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-6075&quot; height=&quot;491&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/woman-standing-near-yellow-petaled-flower-2050994.jpg&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part 7 of a series of lessons in brain health from our elders — those folk who lived the longest and healthiest. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theneuroscienceacademy.mykajabi.com/100-year-old-brain-pdf&quot;&gt;Click here to download the entire series as a PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dementia, memory loss and cognitive decline are robustly related to old age, and AD is one of the leading causes of death globally. So, is the payoff for a longer life memory loss and poor brain health in our final years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, I’ve look to two sources — those exceptionally old folks who remain in robust physical and mental health until the very end of their lives, and our evolutionary past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over millennia, Mother Nature has equipped us to survive and thrive in the wild. Our brains evolved such that from the womb to the tomb we’re required to move, eat well, sleep, immerse ourselves in nature, avoid stress, love and befriend, and seek meaning. These requirements neatly match the everyday life prescriptions followed by the world’s longest-living people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevention is our best defence and the research on dementia is clear. Those of us who lead mentally, socially and physically stimulating lives have reduced risk of age-related brain disease. If we live as close as possible to how Mother Nature intended, while reaping the rewards of our modern healthcare, there is every chance we can add not only years to our lives but life to our years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our human ancestors likely evolved facing similar survival challenges to other species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas the need to acquire food was a major day-to-day challenge during much of our evolutionary history, today we live with a constant oversupply of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, our intellectual challenges focus on work or education, rather than the challenge of acquiring food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientist and ageing researcher, Prof Mark P. Mattson writers in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/25576651/&quot;&gt;Ageing Brain Reviews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular intellectual challenges are critical for brain development and a successful career, and recent findings suggest that intermittent exercise and energy restriction can further enhance and then sustain the functional capabilities of the brain during aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather like an animal in the wild, our intellect evolved to function optimally when we’re motivated towards a goal, slightly hungry, and on foot, a state Mattson likens to &lt;em&gt;‘Hunger Games’ bolstered brainpower. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30089-9&quot;&gt;2017 Trends in Neurosciences&lt;/a&gt; paper, University of Arizona researchers David Raichlen and Gene Alexander support Mattson’s case that our brains are a product of our evolutionary history and our past as hunter-gatherers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They argue as humans transitioned from a relatively sedentary ape-like existence to a more physically demanding hunter-gatherer lifestyle, starting around two million years ago, we began to engage in complex foraging tasks that were simultaneously physically and mentally demanding, and that may explain how moving and thinking came to be so connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the parts of the brain most taxed during high cognitive load tasks such as foraging (the pre-frontal cortex, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex) are the same areas that show vulnerability in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When faced with inactivity as is so common in our modern-day life, our brains adaptively reduce capacity as part of an energy-saving strategy, leading to age-related brain atrophy…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence from modern science and ancient wisdom is clear. How we eat, move, sleep, form relationships and find meaning is intimately connected to how our brains grow, think, feel and, ultimately, age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. The best exercise for your brain is physical exercise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brains and nervous systems evolved to move us around and to sense and perceive the world. Our cognitive prowess and human intellect evolved while we were on foot. Our brains evolved, not to think or feel, but to control how we move. Therefore, moving is the best way we know to keep our brains fit and well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininstitute.ca/docs/final_report_obi_pa_alzheimers_february_25_2013.pdf&quot;&gt;Canadian review&lt;/a&gt; of twenty-four randomised control trials and twenty-one prospective cohort studies calculated that at least one in seven cases of AD could be prevented if everyone who is currently inactive took up exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People living in Blue Zones people don’t run marathons, wear Fitbits, or join Crossfit gyms. Instead, they live in environments that constantly ‘nudge’ them into moving without thinking about it. Jeanne Calment rode her bike till she was 100, and lived in a second-story apartment with no lift until she was 110.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Eat real food, not too much, mostly plants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ancestors and their smart brains were trotting across the landscape hunting, fishing and foraging for food. We evolved to eat food from the rivers, forest and sky. We are also adaptable, and the many versions of a healthy ‘diet’ vary by country, culture (and today by social media platform). What sets those who live the longest apart is not the minutiae of their diet and balance of nutrients gained from fats, protein or carbohydrates, but the absence of refined processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence from epidemiological studies such as the Blue Zones and clinical trials strongly implicates a Mediterranean-style diet slows brain ageing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And most recently, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://foodandmoodcentre.com.au/smiles-trial/&quot;&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; in Australia proved successful in treating depression by encouraging young people with depression to up their consumption of vegetables, fruits, wholegrains, legumes, fish, lean red meats, olive oil and nuts, while reducing their consumption of unhealthy ‘extras’ foods, such as sweets, refined cereals, fried food, fast-food, processed meats and sugary drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we eat, we’re consuming not only nutrients but energy in the form of calories. Researchers, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dunedinstudy.otago.ac.nz/&quot;&gt;Dunedin Study team&lt;/a&gt;, are now unravelling the relationships among calories, lifespan, healthspan and cognitive health. Calorie restriction (eating less) and intermittent fasting (fasting on and off) increases longevity in all species thus far observed, from yeast to rodents to primates — it’s assumed the same is true for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This notion ties back to the ‘Hunger Games’ concept whereby our brains evolved to function most optimally when we’re hungry and looking for food. Eating less benefits our glucose control, cholesterol and may produce mild neuronal stress which engages signalling pathways that improve the ability of the brain to resist ageing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dietary advice for brain health can be summed up by Michael Pollen’s famous adage,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat real food, not too much, mostly plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Get more sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As earthlings, our biological rhythms are determined by the rising and setting of the sun. Our sleep patterns, when hormones are released, our blood pressure and body temperature, ebb and flow in sync with day and night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern-day life with its artificial lighting late at night, alarm clocks, shift work, iPhones in bed, and jetlag, is very good at interfering with our natural sleep patterns. As a basic biological function, sleep is overlooked and underappreciated, and globally, modern humans are chronically sleep-deprived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep deprivation (even a few hours a night) impacts cognition, mood, memory, and learning, and long-term leads to chronic disease including depression, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, all risk factors for developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good night’s sleep every night should be a priority, not a luxury. And my personal daily indulgence, a short afternoon nap, consolidates memory, sparks creativity and smooths your rough emotional edges, giving you greater control over your thoughts and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Challenge your mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lab mice kept in bare cages with no toys or places to explore show greater rates of age-related cognitive decline compared to their counterparts kept in enriched novel environments full of toys, tunnels and mazes. As we’ve discussed, humans are no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who stay mentally engaged in life and constantly challenge themselves to step out of their comfort zone have reduced risk of age-related cognitive decline and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children have a natural tendency to run and play, whereas adults tend take life more seriously. We don’t lose the need for novelty and pleasure once we grow up. Game playing, whether it be video or online, traditional board games, dancing, or team or individual sports, has been shown to alleviate boredom, anxiety, depression, loneliness, despair and even physical pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/add-life-years-uncovering-secrets-successful-ageing-dr-charlen-levitan/&quot;&gt;Charlene Levitan&lt;/a&gt; said to me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t stop playing and learning because we get old, we grow old because we stop playing and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Find your place or moment of calm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One pervasive theme I came across writing my &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/book/&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; was how stress ‘gets under our skin’ to influence our mental and physical health decades later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all stress is bad, but chronic or toxic stress, especially life events that are out of our control, have deleterious effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to buffering stress is to find ways to improve your perceived ability to cope with whatever life throws your way. Find peace amid the chaos. Find your place or moment of calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence is mixed whether or not stress causes dementia, but it’s clear stress hormones alter risk for anxiety, depression, obesity and cardiovascular disease, which in turn increase dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More has been spoken or written about the practice of mindfulness meditation in recent years than any other previously free stress-relief practice. With good reason. Paying attention to your breath, which is a core component of many mindfulness practices, reduced anxiety and depression, and improves sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue Zones people have in place varied daily rituals that reduce or buffer the impact of stress in their lives. Activities include prayer, napping and happy hour with friends. (I’ll add walking the dog or enjoying a good book to the mix.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Connect with family and friends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we foraged, caught or hunted our food, we trotted back to our tribe. Being socially connected to other people protects against stress and because socialising involves many cognitive functions such as thinking, feeling, sensing, reasoning and intuition, friendships contribute to cognitive reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old age brings ‘costs of survivorship,’ and a ‘thinned’ social landscape. Richard Setterson &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15427609.2015.1071944&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We lose people with whom we shared many experiences, who are central to our identities, and who are no longer there to validate — or to question — our memories or accounts. This kind of identity loss also occurs with the death of older generations, as we are pushed up the family ladder and, once at the top, become orphans in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2010 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/20668659/&quot;&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 148 studies including 300 000 people who were tracked for 7.5 years after completing surveys of how often they met with family and friends, found socially connected folks live longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flipside, loneliness was associated with late-life loss of cognition, including elevated blood pressure, depression and poor sleep. The startling conclusion of this report was that the influence of social isolation on the health and risk of death was comparable to smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Seek out meaning and purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With purpose and meaning comes positive emotions — love, compassion, and appreciation — which counteract stress and support a healthy brain throughout life. Blue Zones residents are members of faith communities and find meaning and purpose through spirituality. Living a meaningful life seems an unlikely addition to a book about the brain, but ‘purpose in life’ is a concept in neuroscience that links to robust brain and mind health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purpose, defined as the tendency to derive meaning from life’s experiences and to possess a sense of intentionality and goal-directedness that guides behaviour, can be quantified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study published in Archives of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897172/&quot;&gt;General Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; in 2010 examined the association of purpose in life with risk of AD in more than 900 elderly people living in residential care. During the seven years of follow-up, greater purpose in life was associated with a substantially reduced risk of AD, such that a person with a high score on the purpose in life measure was approximately two and half times more likely to remain free of AD than a person with a low score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you figured out why you’re here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s your north star? Your ‘ikigai’. Your ‘plan de vida’? There are possibly many clever strategies to find meaning of your life — somewhere in the nexus of passion, skillset, employment opportunity, education and service to others. William James the psychologist said in 1920,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve come across a simpler way. Over the years, I’ve taken taken stage with Paul Baldock, a bone biologist at Sydney’s Garvan Institute of Medical Research. We called on to share our wisdom, purpose and what we’ve learned on our career paths in science. Baldock has developed a novel formula for every decision he makes in the research lab, career, and life. He simply asks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it awesome? Does it help?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part 7 of a series of lessons in brain health from our elders — those folk who lived the longest and healthiest. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theneuroscienceacademy.mykajabi.com/100-year-old-brain-pdf&quot;&gt;Click here to download the entire series as a PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether we like it or not, our parents play a big part in who we become as adults. From our taste in music to our social values, their imprint often stays with us, good or bad, well past childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now new &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0192513X19875772&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that we still rely on them well into mid-life — at least when it comes to our health, that is. Alexandra Kissling and Corinne Reczek, a team from the Ohio State University, found that while we look to our mothers in much the same way we do when we’re children — asking them for advice and hoping they’ll be there to help us through periods of bad health,  for instance — fathers act more like “cautionary tales”, examples of what not to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38370&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore this phenomenon, the team conducted 90 qualitative interviews with midlife adult children: 45 gay, lesbian and straight couples aged between 40 and 60 years old. As they interviewed the couples, the researchers examined the influence of both the participants’ parents and their in-laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each participant, interviewed separately from their spouse, was asked open-ended questions about their &lt;span&gt;their health and their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;relationship with their family, such as “tell me about your relationship with your parents and your spouse’s parents”. More specific and targeted questions were also introduced, including “how do your parents support you during hard times” and “do your in-laws talk to you about their health?”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, many participants explained that family provided support throughout illness or injury — helping out after surgery, for example, or providing material support through the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. This provided a boost to well-being for both children and their partners, with the extra support often allowing partners to continue going to work and managing the household alongside caring for their spouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But 37 participants described parents as acting as “cautionary tales” — making a positive impact on their health, but doing so by acting as warnings. And this was particularly true of fathers. “Adults in our study talked about how they were affected by their fathers having really poor health behaviors, like smoking or heavy drinking,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.osu.edu/fathers-are-cautionary-tales-about-health-for-some-adults&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Kissling. “They really wanted to make sure they didn’t make the same mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the continued support of mothers in adulthood could be related to “intensive mothering” — the idea that mothers are not only primary caregivers but that they also put everything into parenting, often placing the needs of their offspring before their own. “The level of caring never stops, and mothers are there to help their children even as adults,” Kissling explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much we can read into these results is up for debate, however. Self-reporting is not always the most accurate way to measure impact: many of our behaviours run contrary to what we might say, on paper, we believe or feel. It’s easy to imagine that this could particularly include our relationships with our parents: as the researchers note themselves, we are often “closely intertwined” with members of our family, meaning we don’t always have the emotional distance to judge how those relationships impact us. In cases where familial relationships are difficult or complex, this may be even more true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample size, 90, is also small, especially when you think of the multitude of family dynamics that play out across the wider population. In non-traditional family set-ups — single parent or same-sex families, for example — these findings may not apply. And in a society in which gendered norms are currently being renegotiated and rethought, it’s hard to say how long these particular relationships and assumptions about the roles of mothers and fathers will last. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/dec/01/meet-the-couples-who-share-parental-leave-and-its-highs-and-lows&quot;&gt;Advances&lt;/a&gt; in parental leave may mean the practice of “intensive mothering” levels out, for instance: mothers may traditionally have done the bulk of a family’s caring activities, but this is by no means set in stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But however our parents actually do impact our health, this research does provide important insight into how we &lt;em&gt;perceive &lt;/em&gt;this impact. Though we may not always have the most accurate or objective understanding of how our family relationships work, understanding the way we experience them is still worthy of attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0192513X19875772&quot;&gt;Intensive Mothers, Cautionary Tale Fathers: Adult Children’s Perceptions of Parental Influence on Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of today’s scientists and philosophers believe that human beings are just physical objects, very complicated machines, the essential part of which is our brain which is sometimes conscious.  My belief is that on the contrary each human consists of a body which is a physical object, and a soul which is an immaterial thing, interacting with their body; it is our soul that is conscious and is the essential part of each of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One argument for this comes from the structure of our brains. Our brains consist of a left and a right cerebral hemisphere and a cerebellum. Our conscious lives depend on the operation of the upper part of each cerebral hemisphere, the cerebral cortex. Occasionally patients with severe epilepsy originating in one hemisphere have that hemisphere removed. It is a recent neuroscientific discovery that, whether surgeons remove the left hemisphere or the right hemisphere, the patient thinks and behaves in much the same way as before (except for not having epileptic fits), at least in the respect that his memories remain largely the same and his character is not very different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgeons are now just beginning to be able to reconnect severed spinal nerves, and they are on the way to being able to connect a severed spinal nerve to a new nerve obtained from elsewhere. The nerves which connect brain parts with other brain parts are nerves of the same kind as spinal nerves. Hence it should become possible for surgeons to remove one hemisphere by severing the nerves which connect it to the rest of the brain and join the severed nerves to another brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now suppose that both hemispheres are removed from a person whom I will call Alexandra and also from two other persons, Alex and Sandra. Alexandra’s left hemisphere is then connected to Alex’s brain, and Alexandra’s right hemisphere is connected to Sandra’s brain. Then both of two subsequent persons would claim to be Alexandra, since their one cerebral hemisphere obtained from Alexandra would provide them with Alexandra’s memories and character. Each of them would have equal claims to be Alexandra, and there would seem to be no possible subsequent experiment which could show which (if either) of them was Alexandra. Now consider one such person, for example the person who has Alex’s body. It is logically compatible with everything we could possibly discover about her body and brain, her memories and character that she is Alexandra; and logically compatible with everything we could possibly discover that she is not Alexandra. So there must be something else about her which we are not able to observe which would make her Alexandra – if she is Alexandra; and the absence of which would make her not Alexandra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That something cannot be a material part, since we know everything about all the material parts already (they are what constitute her new brain) and they do not suffice to make her who she is; so it must be an immaterial part that is a soul. We go where our soul goes. Under normal conditions our soul goes where our brain goes; but under abnormal conditions, such as when the brain is divided, it is unknowable where our soul goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured image credit: “Beige liquid illustration photo” by Paweł Czerwiński via &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/Q5oCIFL2xKc&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/our-souls-make-us-who-we-are/&quot;&gt;Our souls make us who we are&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/608711226/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/608711226/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/608711226/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/608711226/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/608711226/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/608711226/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/608711226/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/608711226/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/608711226/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/608711226/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/brexit-when-psychology-politics-clash/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Brexit: when psychology and politics clash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/fake-news-gone-viral-how-misunderstanding-scientific-uncertainty-leads-epidemics/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fake news gone viral: How misunderstanding scientific uncertainty leads to epidemics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/how-meningitis-almost-conquered/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How meningitis has (almost) been conquered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

Nor am I especially knowledgeable about the differences between &lt;a href=&quot;https://backpackerverse.com/medium-channeling/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mediumship vs. channeling&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mediumship is mostly about receiving and interpreting messages from other worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mediums often deliver messages from loved ones and spirit guides during readings.&lt;br /&gt;. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...channeling is often about receiving messages from other types of entities, such as nature spirits, spirit guides, or even angels.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Channelling&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;channelers are free to make stuff up as they go along&quot;&gt;Channels&lt;/a&gt; can communicate with a broader class of non-corporeal entities, for instance Mahatma Ghandi or Cleopatra (not only the dead relatives of paying clients).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What seems to be uncontroversial, however, is that Channels who enter into a trance state to convey the wisdom of Gandhi may experience an altered or “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/38561-channeling.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;expanded&lt;/a&gt;” state of consciousness (regardless of the veracity of their communications). This permuted state of arousal should be manifest in the electroencephalogram (EEG) as an alteration in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15377585&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spectral power&lt;/a&gt; across the range of frequency bands (e.g., theta, alpha, beta etc.) that have been associated with different &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/20/7082.short&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;states of consciousness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A group of researchers at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://noetic.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;'a research center and direct-experience lab specializing in the intersection of science and human experience'&quot;&gt;Institute of Noetic Sciences&lt;/a&gt; adopted this view in a study of persons who claimed the ability to channel (&lt;a href=&quot;https://f1000research.com/articles/8-67/v2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wahbeh et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;). The participants (n=13; 11 &lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd NA6bn&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e24Kjd&quot;&gt;♀, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;2 &lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd NA6bn&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e24Kjd&quot;&gt;♂&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) were on average 57 year old white women of upper middle class socioeconomic status, representative of the study site in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_County,_California#Places_by_population,_race,_and_income&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Marin County&lt;/a&gt;, California. The authors screened 155 individuals to arrive at their final sample size.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Among the stringent inclusion criteria was the designation of being a Channel who directly and actively conveys the communications of a discarnate entity or spirit (rather than being a passive relay).&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The participants were free of major psychiatric disorders, including psychosis and dissociation (according to self-report). Oh, and they had the ability to remain still during the channeling episodes, which was advantageous for the physiological measurements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The participants alternated between channeling and no-channeling in 5 minute blocks while EEG and peripheral physiological signals (skin conductance, heart rate, respiration, temperature) were recorded. At the end of each counterbalanced session (run on separate days), voice recordings were obtained while the participants read stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lfcLf7VnybU/Xb5WMBQLxLI/AAAAAAAAM-Y/fdTxFxNuQqg00oWzlMtZmYQyQHTs_hyfQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Channel%2B-%2BNoChannel.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;455&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;181&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lfcLf7VnybU/Xb5WMBQLxLI/AAAAAAAAM-Y/fdTxFxNuQqg00oWzlMtZmYQyQHTs_hyfQCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Channel%2B-%2BNoChannel.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to the authors' predictions, they found no significant differences between the channeling and no-channeling conditions for any of the physiological measures, nor for the EEG analyzed in standard frequency bands (theta 3–7 Hz; alpha 8–12 Hz; beta 13–20 Hz and low gamma 21–40 Hz) across 64 electrodes. I'll note here that the data acquisition and analysis methods were top-notch. The senior author (&lt;span class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://arnauddelorme.com/eeglab/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arnaud Delorme&lt;/a&gt;) developed the widely used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15102499&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EEGLAB toolbox&lt;/a&gt; for data analysis, which was described in one of the most highly cited articles in neuroscience&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;&quot;&gt;.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Modest differences in voice parameters were observed: the channeled readings were softer in volume and slower in pace. The authors acknowledged that the participants could have impersonated an alternate voice during the channeling segments, whether consciously or unconsciously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So does this mean that channeling is a sham? The authors don't think so. Instead, they recommended further investigation: “future studies should include other measures such as EEG connectivity analyses, fMRI and biomarkers.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is a rather esoteric population, so I won't fault the researchers for having a small sample size. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;“The channeler goes into a trance state at will (the depth of the trance  may vary) and the disincarnate entity/spirit uses the channeler’s body  with permission to communicate &lt;i&gt;directly&lt;/i&gt; through the channeler's  voice, body movements, etc. (rather than the channeler receiving  information mentally or otherwise and then relaying what is being  received).”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I was rather critical of a previous study by this research group, which was ultimately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00173/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;retracted&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;i&gt;Frontiers in Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;.

What has changed?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u59jZctaKXY/XbsOETmAnYI/AAAAAAAAn5o/xy48ytfUcb0Js5vVKD4LsOn16gsAVtdHQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Vijay%2BPix%2BYim%2BGulmarg_edited1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;937&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1366&quot; height=&quot;219&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u59jZctaKXY/XbsOETmAnYI/AAAAAAAAn5o/xy48ytfUcb0Js5vVKD4LsOn16gsAVtdHQCNcBGAsYHQ/s320/Vijay%2BPix%2BYim%2BGulmarg_edited1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last year a group of European research funders calling themselves cOAlition S launched a radical new open-access initiative dubbed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plan S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The aim: to ensure that all research papers resulting from work they fund are made immediately freely available on the internet. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plan S has been controversial, not least because its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;principles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; outlaw** the use of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_open-access_journal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;hybrid OA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (although a transition period is permitted if time-limited “transformative arrangements” are put in place). By banning** hybrid OA, some researchers have complained, cOAlition S is effectively telling them where they can and cannot publish. This they believe to be an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20181107234431569&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;infringement of their academic freedom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For their part, publishers worry that the plan is being introduced too quickly and has not been thought through properly. As a result, some say, it could have “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms1900864&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;serious unintended consequences for the integrity of the scientific literature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;”. And while the initial start date for Plan S has been extended from 2020 to 2021, there continue to be concerns that the timescale is too aggressive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;More importantly, while the Plan S &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;implementation guidelines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;permit open access to be provided by publishing in open access journals, on open access platforms, or by depositing papers in a repository without embargo, most believe that the practical outcome of the initiative will be a near-universal pay-to-publish environment in which the main beneficiaries will be the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;publishing oligopoly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, not the research community. Essentially, say critics, courtesy of new-style Big Deals (aka “transformative agreements”) commercial publishers will be able to continue profiting excessively by migrating their current exorbitant profits to the new OA environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;How successful has Plan S been? On launch cOAlition S consisted of 11 funders. Today that number is still just &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/funders/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Significantly, the coalition has failed to persuade public funders in the US or China to join (these two countries are the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;largest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; publishers of research papers in the world). At the same time, it has lost members: the Swedish funder &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2019/06/why-did-riksbankens-jubileumsfond.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Riksbankens Jubileumsfond&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;pulled out in June, and the Italian funder &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/apacx/status/1167461519124246531?s=20&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Compagnia di San Paolo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;left cOAlition S in August. On the other hand, some believe that Plan S has so alarmed publishers that the coalition has already achieved its objective (depending on what one believes the objective to be). &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is, however, clearly problematic that cOAlition S has remained an essentially European initiative. For this reason when, in February, the Indian Government’s Principal Scientific Adviser, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blogger.com/null&quot; name=&quot;_Hlk23342073&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._VijayRaghavan&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Professor VijayRaghavan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;posted a series of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PrinSciAdvGoI/status/1095266653930024960&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tweets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; saying that India was joining cOAlition S the news was greeted with great excitement by cOAlition S &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/robertkiley/status/1095301069675085824?s=20&quot;&gt;members&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;as well as by Plan S supporters like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Moedas/status/1095701070624550912?s=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;the European Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Moedas/status/1095701070624550912?s=20&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Carlos Moedas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The news was greeted with less enthusiasm back home in India, with concerns raised about the cost implications, the likely impact on small journals and publishers, and the way in which it would allow commercial publishers to continue to profit excessively from the research community – see&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, for instance, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cis-india.org/a2k/blogs/should-india-adopt-plan-s-to-realise-open-access-to-public-funded-scientific-research&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/the-sciences/six-concerns-over-india-joining-the-plan-s-coalition-for-science-journals&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://confluence.ias.ac.in/plan-s-model-of-research-publication-a-serious-and-unwarranted-drain-on-money-meant-for-actual-research/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Following Prof. VijayRaghavan’s tweets, however, radio silence set in, with no confirmation that India had formally joined, or any updates on the status of its plans. For this reason many ears pricked up last Friday when, during a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjS7fgnNJtc&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;lecture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; he gave at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iisc.ac.in/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;IISc Bangalore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;to mark Open Access Week, Prof. VijayRaghavan commented, “We are not committed to whatever Plan S does or does not do.” This sufficiently piqued the interest of &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/author/mukunth&quot;&gt;Vasudevan Mukunth&lt;/a&gt; that he sought out Prof. VijayRaghavan and asked for clarification, which led to an interview in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/the-sciences/plan-s-open-access-scientific-publishing-article-processing-charge-insa-k-vijayraghavan&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Wire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; where it was confirmed that India no longer plans to join cOAlition S. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I had been trying to interview Prof. VijayRaghavan for some months, I too was piqued by his comments and so took to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RickyPo/status/1187726568854052865?s=20&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to again invite him to answer the questions I had sent him in June. He agreed and below are his answers to an updated list of questions I emailed over to him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;The Indian context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So why did India change its mind? It turns out that while little was being said in public there has been a lot of internal discussion taking place in India about open access and Plan S. This has led to a consensus that India needs to find an OA solution more suited to its specific needs. As Prof. VijayRaghavan commented to &lt;i&gt;The Wire&lt;/i&gt;, Plan S “is by definition a Eurocentric approach … We will work with them to learn about what they’re doing ... [but] ... What we do will be what we think is best for our context.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What this will mean in detail is not entirely clear at the moment. However, current thinking is reflected in a document published recently by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;three Indian national academies called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://insaindia.res.in/pdf/Publication_of_Literature.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Suggestions for a National Framework for Publication of and Access to Literature in Science and Technology in India&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This document (as one might expect) argues that all scientific literature arising from public-funded research should be available in the public domain. It also recommends that there should be an explicit provision in research grants to pay publication charges (APCs) so that papers can be made open access. In addition, it says, preprints should be encouraged, and India’s various national repositories should be “synergised, strengthened, and harmonised into a single national institutional system.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Importantly, the document also says that researchers should have “the choice of final destination for the publication of their work”. This assertion alone would seem to put India’s thinking at variance with Plan S, which by banning** hybrid OA is expected to significantly reduce the number of journals that European researchers will be able to publish in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, the framework document proposes as an optimum choice what it calls a “One Nation-One Subscription” model. This would seem to imply that the government will negotiate the licensing of paywalled content directly with publishers – which would be a departure from current practice where individual Indian research organisations negotiate their own licensing contracts, the details of which are kept secret. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In short, it seems that India is still moving towards a national open access policy, but wants to develop its own approach rather than join cOAlition S. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It has taken India a while to get to this point. OA advocates have been calling for a national OA policy for some years, and i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;n 2017 they even drafted a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zenodo.org/record/1002618#.XRDBuuhKhhE&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;proposed policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and invited organisations like the University Grants Commission (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ugc.ac.in/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;UGC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;), the Department of Biotechnology (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dbtindia.nic.in/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DBT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) and the Department of Science and Technology (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dst.gov.in/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) to sign up to it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;While nothing came of this effort, a number of institutional policies have been in place in India for some years, including the policy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://openaccessindia.org/indias-top-scientific-departments-announces-oa-policy/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;introduced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in 2014 by the DBT and the DST (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dst.gov.in/sites/default/files/APPROVED%20OPEN%20ACCESS%20POLICY-DBT%26DST%2812.12.2014%29_1.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3BQKrwDGWb1X77c_TvbFMLdpQDgKtlpV8yVEi5GlzOrj7P1HrTTygAY4E&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). These policies are essentially &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access#Green_OA&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;green open access&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; policies in which researchers are asked to post all their final accepted manuscripts (post-prints) either in a relevant institutional repository or in one of the Ministry’s central repositories (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dst.sciencecentral.in/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dbt.sciencecentral.in/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). These policies, however, are recommendations rather than requirements, and most researchers appear to have ignored them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Judging by the framework document, it would seem that all the necessary elements for a national open access policy are in place and have been considered. The secret will lie in putting these elements together in a way that works, and which does not produce unintended consequences. Creating a national open access policy is not unlike playing a difficult game of chess.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is worth noting here that the open access movement has always had two primary objectives. First to solve the accessibility problem (i.e. provide open access). Second, to solve the affordability problem (i.e. reduce the costs of scholarly communication). It has been learned over the years, however, that getting researchers to engage with open access is very difficult and OA policies often have the effect of increasing rather than reducing costs – not least because the research community needs to continue paying licensing fees to get access to paywalled content &lt;i&gt;plus&lt;/i&gt; pay publishing fees to enable researchers to make their papers OA in the journals they want to be seen in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is for this reason that Plan S has banned** hybrid open access (which leads to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rluk.ac.uk/the-costs-of-double-dipping/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;double dipping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) and it is why transformative agreements are becoming so popular. The latter combine licensing fees with publishing fees in a single agreement that is (theoretically) cost-neutral. It does not, however, solve the affordability problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;India seems to be taking a different approach, insisting that publishers agree to “capped subscriptions” and “capped APCs”, with the aim both of making its research open access while also lowering costs. How this will work in practice, and whether it is possible to persuade publishers to buy into the idea, has yet to be established. Discussions are apparently only just beginning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What does not help is that researchers are addicted to the Impact Factor and other proxy measures of quality. It is this that has allowed commercial publishers to acquire the power over the research community that they have, and which allows them to effectively name their own price for the services they provide. As Prof. VijayRaghavan puts it below, researchers have been chasing the “derivatives of science” rather than science itself that. “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The publishing industry feeds this monster of narcissism and the monster is addicted to the food.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sridhar Gutam, Founder &amp;amp; Convenor of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://openaccessindia.org/author/gutam2000/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Open Access India&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; agrees with Prof. VijayRaghavan. “Authors in India are obsessed with commercial publishers and impact factors, and they are willing to pool money in order to pay the APCs needed to get published in OA journals like &lt;i&gt;Nature Reports&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Frontiers&lt;/i&gt;, and PLOS,” he says. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And as noted, simply exchanging subscription fees for APCs is unlikely to reduce the costs of scholarly communication (unless India can persuade publishers otherwise). “What India should do therefore is introduce a national mandatory green open access policy requiring that when researchers publish in subscription journals they self-archive copies in online repositories. This provides open access without the need to pay an APC,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; says Gutam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, he adds, Indian scholarly societies should be publishing their own journals using open source software like Open Journal Systems (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;OJS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). “Peer reviewing is voluntary, publication software like OJS is free of charge and open-source, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://portal.amelica.org/ameli/?fbclid=IwAR3f0BHeGJyqAw4tJ9r9d_ieLVFrsUGymnqYVNRJSSXGKp6dYqSv-VLPnEU&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;AmeliCA XML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; – which allows journals to convert Word documents to the various online formats – is now also free and open source. Why should we be incurring huge costs in APCs?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, India would still need to pay licensing fees if it wants continuing access to the huge backlog of paywalled content publishers have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interestingly, the approach being adopted by Plan S is theoretically compatible with what Gutam calls for. The problem is that the aggressive timescale set by cOAlition S does not allow sufficient time for the development of much in the way of alternative platforms and open-source journals, and the guidelines it has set for repository-based open access are too onerous and too costly. Meanwhile, the fad for transformative deals is being driven by the narcissism that Prof. VijayRaghavan complains of, plus the convenience they offer for librarians. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whether India can find a better model than Plan S remains to be seen. The truth is that there are no easy options here. That is why 18 years after the Budapest Open Access Initiative people are still scrabbling around for solutions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;The interview begins …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;In February you posted a series of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PrinSciAdvGoI/status/1095266653930024960&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;tweets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;saying that India was planning to join cOAlition S. I understand that India has changed its mind? Can you say why? What about Plan S no longer seems appropriate for India?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have not had formal interactions with cOAlition S since February. Internally (within India), we have better clarity on the ways we would like to proceed. This is what we will focus on and should there be substantive overlap with what cOAlition S finalises, that will be good, and also likely is my guess. Fundamentally, the nature and complexities in India are substantially different from Europe – our focus is on what will be meaningful here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q: What is it about Plan S specifically that no longer seems appropriate for India?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s perhaps is inappropriately posed. We are focusing on what is appropriate for India, and I’ve outlined that. As you can see there will be aspects that overlap with cOAlition S. As we have delved deeper, we see complexities and requirements here that we need to address. We will hear from Plan S and others on their progress and tell them about ours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q: Three Indian national academies recently published a set of recommendations for a national policy on open access. I assume this was at the request of the Indian government. I believe the optimum choice that the academies have proposed is what it calls a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blogger.com/null&quot; name=&quot;_Hlk23324877&quot;&gt;“One Nation-One Subscription” model.&lt;/a&gt; That seems to imply licensing content from publishers. An &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/the-sciences/plan-s-open-access-scientific-publishing-article-processing-charge-insa-k-vijayraghavan&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Wire&lt;i&gt; indicated that India will likely be introducing a green OA model. How do you envisage these two approaches working together in practice?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;We welcome the academies’ views. We will also continue to have wide engagements with researchers and students. We then hope to have formal discussions with major publishers. It’s too early to commit to a route. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q: What is a “One Nation-One Subscription” model?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s the academies’ phrase, is it not? So, best to ask them. From the government’s perspective, publishers now have portfolios that are akin to making cable TV channel choices with different rates for each portfolio. Some normalisation is needed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q: The academies’ recommendations also say that government research grants in India should include an explicit provision for paying APCs. Might this not mean that costs will go up for India as a result?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not if there is an APC cap and that is paid independent of your grant. The aim is to capture the current costs accurately. Separately calculate what we assess as reasonable costs for services such as quality reviewing etc. And see how we can go from the first, down to the second. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q: In order to keep costs down Plan S seems more focused on “transformative” deals in which agreements are signed with publishers where the publisher provides both access to its paywalled content &lt;u&gt;plus&lt;/u&gt; publishing rights to allow researchers to publish their papers open access. What are your views on this approach and why would it not work for India?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;In our view, all content should be accessible and not behind a paywall, including archival content. All publicly funded research should be freely accessible. These are areas where there is much overlap with Plan S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;That value has a price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q: In the lecture you gave last week, you said India plans to negotiate “capped subscriptions” and “capped APCs” with publishers for the country. How hopeful are you that you will achieve that? I do not believe that India is eligible for initiatives like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.research4life.org/&quot;&gt;Research4Life&lt;/a&gt; or for reduced or waived APCs. How likely is it that publishers will agree to these capped fees? What leverage can India bring to bear on publishers here?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;‘Classical” publishers, learned societies, open-access journals all bring value. That value has a price. On the other side, publicly supported knowledge should not be behind a paywall, and the costs of publishing should not be exorbitant, and should be calibrated for economies such as India, where the rupee-dollar exchange rate means steep differentials in the ability to pay. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are sensible solutions possible, and we will put these on the table. I am sure that the publishers will participate to deliver a viable, correct and principled solution. The present situation is none of the three. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q: In your lecture, you also stressed the need for access to research to be provided not just for the research community, but for every citizen. Uruguay’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/PortalTimbo/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Portal Timbo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; and Egypt’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Knowledge_Bank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Knowledge Bank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; are national portals where content has been licensed from a range of scholarly publishers and aggregated on one site, and anyone in the country can access that content. Is that what you have in mind?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blogger.com/null&quot; name=&quot;_Hlk23325027&quot;&gt;The &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ndl.iitkgp.ac.in/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;National Digital Library of India&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is doing this. Not yet through licensing. But, yes, we will explore other models here too and will discuss with their proponents. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q: Plan S is not the only open-access game in town today. Under the aegis of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amelica.org/en/index.php/2019/01/10/amelica-vs-plan-s-mismo-objetivo-dos-estrategias-distintas-para-lograr-el-acceso-abierto/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;AmeliCA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, for instance, Latin America is proposing a different approach based on national journals and open access platforms. It has also co-founded (with UNESCO) the Global Alliance of Open Access Scholarly Communication Platforms (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.unesco.org/news/launch-global-alliance-open-access-scholarly-communication-platforms-democratize-knowledge&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;GLOALL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;) in order to propagate this model. What do you think are the pros and cons of this approach as compared with Plan S? Might it turn out to be closer to Indian needs than Plan S? Do you see a possibility that the open access movement could splinter, and the scholarly communication system splinter in the process, with the South taking a different approach to the North?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have not yet explored these models in detail, though I am aware of them. We will discuss with them and with cOAlition S too, of course. There are key differences between North and South, there is a South in the North and a North in the South. So, a binary is simplistic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are discussing access for all of India. I think this will actually integrate the scholarly communication system, rather than splinter it. This is about scientists and citizens everywhere. Publishers are the vehicles that carry the message, but the directions, the speed, the access and the cost of travel should not be determined by the marketplace, in the main. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Nationally capped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q: There has been some concern about Plan S’s decision to ban** &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_open-access_journal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;hybrid OA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and to insist that the liberal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;CC BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;licence must be attached to all papers.

What are your views on these particular issues?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;All research should be openly available upon publication. The use of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ArXiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; etc. will be encouraged. Subscription fees should allow access to all articles in the journal, with the costs of subscription nationally capped – APCs should be borne by funding agencies and there should be negotiated caps on all these. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q: Is open access in your view solely about increasing access to research, or should it also be viewed as a way of reducing the costs of scholarly publishing?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both. Access to quality publishing has costs, of course. But context-dependent reasonable costs will be there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q: In your lecture you said that India currently pays 1,500 crores ($211 million) a year for subscriptions and 150 crores ($21 million) for APCs. In your interview with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Wire&lt;i&gt; the journalist suggested that the APC figures are likely much higher. (He thought the figure should properly be more in the region of 985 crore). I get the feeling that no country in the world knows how much its researchers are paying for open access and this might be a particular issue in the Global South. For instance, a &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zenodo.org/record/3464868#.XbVNtej7RhG&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;recent study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;indicated that 60% of researchers that had paid an APC in the developing world had had to fund it themselves. How problematic is this when trying to develop a national policy on open access?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;The publishers know. We can get better and better estimates, of course, but it will be simplest for the publishers to put that on the table. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q: In your lecture you seemed to imply that there is really no need for intermediaries in scholarly communication anymore. Do you think that publishers are no longer needed? If they are still needed, how does their role need to change?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Publishers will not perish, nor should they. But their current forms will change. The way research is assessed and used in academia needs to change too. Publishers need to change. Quality need not be excessively expensive and does not have to be the enemy of access. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q: One of the benefits of a national OA policy, perhaps, is that researchers can also be encouraged to post their papers in preprint servers like arXiv prior to the peer review process taking place. This allows research to be shared more quickly. What future role do you see for preprints in scholarly communication?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Preprint servers such as arXiv are very important. They are the foundation for scholarly communication and ‘journal publishing’ should be built on this foundation and follow this and not be separate or confrontational. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;The monster of narcissism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q: In your lecture, you also said words to the effect that any achievement made by a researcher needs to be viewed as an achievement not for the individual but for the whole community. Can you expand on that and its implications for the Indian research community?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Globally, not just India. All, with very, very rare exceptions, scientific success is built principally by the efforts of many contemporaries and on the work of many more predecessors. Singling out individuals as icons through awards, fellowships and honours of certain kinds has resulted in many scientists chasing these derivatives of science rather than scientific questions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The publishing industry feeds this monster of narcissism and the monster is addicted to the food. When confronted, the successful (by these metrics) point to the many good features of this egregious system, and there is a point here. There is indeed science of different qualities and valuing those and recognising quality is very important. Therefore, those individuals who are so recognised must see themselves as one of the many of high-quality who will never have any recognition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;They must also strive to enhance the spread of quality-science. Hiring, awards and promotion committees need to step back, think, and not conflate precision (IF etc) with accuracy (the value of the work). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q: You say, “All, with very, very rare exceptions, scientific success is built principally by the efforts of many contemporaries and on the work or many more predecessors. Singling out individuals as icons through awards, fellowships and honours of certain kinds has resulted in many scientists chasing these derivatives of science rather than scientific questions”. In your lecture, you also said this but then highlighted a record in The National Digital Library by a famous Indian scientist. Do you not think there is a kind of contradiction there? Is it not inevitable that individuals considered particularly talented will always be singled out?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Individuals will get singled out and individuals do matter. Just two points. First, chase the science, not the derivative (journals, awards etc). Second, when recognised, acknowledge the team and bat for the team. You are ‘special’ because of the team, in very large measure.  And, there are many like you, and better, who were not recognised as ‘special’. So, a wee bit of humility may not be such a bad thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q: In connection with this you said that researchers need to get beyond the current obsession of where they publish. One reason why open access has struggled to make headway is that researchers are evaluated, rewarded and promoted based on the Impact Factor and/or prestige of the journals they publish in, and these journals are usually subscription journals. The 2012 San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/read/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;DORA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;) was intended to address this problem, with signatories asked to commit to “not use journal-based metrics, such as Journal Impact Factors, as a surrogate measure of the quality of individual research articles, to assess an individual scientist’s contributions, or in hiring, promotion, or funding decisions”. I believe you have personally signed DORA, and one of the directors of the National Center For Biological Sciences is on the DORA board, as previously was the Wellcome Trust DBT project head. But I am not aware that many Indian research institution have signed up to DORA. Do you envisage the Indian government directing them to commit to the principles of DORA?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I said in my interview. There is nothing to stop institutions from changing from within. Else, change may well come from outside. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q: As you will know, the global research community has been struggling to cope with the rise of predatory publishing, a phenomenon some claim is a direct consequence of pay-to-publish gold open access. India has been a particular victim of this. It is also the location of a number of predatory publishers, and last year the US Federal Trade Commission obtained a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/152-3113/federal-trade-commission-v-omics-group-inc&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;summary judgement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; against one Indian predatory publisher, which has been told to pay a $50 million fine. What are your views on predatory publishing and its impact on the research community in India? How much of a problem is it and what is the Indian Government doing to address the problem?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A menace here and everywhere. The Government is addressing this and is constantly alert to addressing the extraordinarily innovative predatory publisher community as each instance emerges. Such hydras will keep coming. Strong internal standards, messaging and strong action when such publishers are detected is needed. Yes, pay-to-publish gold open access has a (negative) role here, perhaps. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;----&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;** Update 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; November 2019:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It has been suggested to me that my use of the words “ban” and “outlaw” in connection with hybrid OA in the above text is not strictly accurate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I also cited a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06178-7&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from September 2018 which states “As written, Plan S would bar researchers from publishing in 85% of journals, including influential titles such as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let me try to clarify.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/&quot;&gt;Principle 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of Plan S reads, “The Funders do not support the ‘hybrid’ model of publishing. However, as a transitional pathway towards full Open Access within a clearly defined timeframe, and only as part of transformative arrangements, Funders may contribute to financially supporting such arrangements”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Subsequent to the publication of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; article, cOAlition S published its “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coalition-s.org%2Fprinciples-and-implementation%2F&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Ceaf32c4b4e404aa27cb708d75ecc2f2e%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637082103375774307&amp;amp;sdata=Y2DWdcf2oPLOTeTs3zshKuOCOFZOnz0SO0TN0v0TTJE%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;&gt;Guidance on the Implementation of Plan S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;”. Under the funding section of Route Two to compliance in that guidance, it states, “cOAlition S funders will not financially support ‘hybrid’ Open Access publication fees in subscription venues.” Note the addition of the word &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;financially&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;That section also says, “Authors [can] publish in a subscription journal and make either the final published version (Version of Record (VoR)) or the Author’s Accepted Manuscript (AAM) openly available in a repository.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It might, therefore, be more accurate to say that cOAlition S moved from a position in which was outlawing hybrid OA to one in which it does not support it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Technically, therefore, Plan S does not now ban authors from publishing in a hybrid journal, so long as they pay the APCs themselves and immediately post the AAM or VoR online with a CC BY licence attached. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;So, I accept that my use of the words “ban” and “outlaw” might be a little strong, and that the figure of 85% is now out of date (I have removed that from the text). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;However, I do believe that, in practice, Plan S will prevent researchers from publishing in hybrid journals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here is why I say that:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since Plan S funders won’t cover fees for hybrid journals researchers will be strongly discouraged from publishing in a hybrid journal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is worth noting that the guidance document also says, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“cOAlition S urges individual researchers, research institutions, other funders, and governments not to financially support ‘hybrid’ Open Access publishing when such fees are not part of transformative arrangements.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moreover, I really doubt that most researchers will read beyond Principle 8 (which is ambiguous) or, if they do, understand (or want to spend time understanding) the nuances of the guidance document.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since it seems authors will also need to post copies of hybrid OA articles in a repository in tandem with publication, and with a CC BY licence attached, this will (in my view) be a further strong disincentive to publishing in a hybrid journal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

By serving as a provider on the Science Exchange platform, we are able to rapidly start projects with these clients, since all work is covered by Science Exchange’s standardized agreement and no further legal steps are required. Furthermore, the platform has made project management, invoicing, and payment much easier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A large review of studies published over the past 40 years has found little evidence that cannabis is helpful in treating mental health conditions like depression and anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2221327-there-is-little-evidence-that-cannabis-helps-mental-health-problems/&quot;&gt;Ruby Prosser Scully reports&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers say that &lt;span&gt;people should be wary of claims by companies producing medical cannabis, and that t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;here is a need for more large-scale, well-controlled studies into the effects of the drug on different conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38355&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“As more data points come in, understanding and interpretation become more complete — and more nuanced. Mischel’s original work on the marshmallow test wasn’t wrong. It was simply incomplete.”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://elemental.medium.com/the-ongoing-controversy-over-the-marshmallow-test-b495db1809be&quot;&gt;Erman Misirlisoy explores the “squishy” legacy of the marshmallow test&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Elemental&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another classic experiment has also been revisted this week: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benjamin &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Libet’s work on free will. &lt;/strong&gt;In a 1983 experiment, Libet famously found that particular patterns of brain activity come before people’s conscious decision to make a movement&lt;span&gt; — &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;a finding that, it was originally claimed, showed free will to be an illusion. Since then, Libet’s findings have gone through various interpretations and re-interpretations  — and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2019/10/31/the-ghost-of-libet-returns/#.XbxE8jP7SUl&quot;&gt;Neuroskeptic has written about the latest iteration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;over at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discover &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having narcissistic tendencies is related to lower levels of stress and depression&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inverse.com/article/60534-dark-personality-trait-depression-mental-health&quot;&gt;reports Emma Betuel at &lt;em&gt;Inverse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Research suggests that narcissism is related to “mental toughness” and that this may provide a buffer against stressors — though there’s still work to be done to disentangle cause-and-effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can science ever explain consciousness? &lt;/strong&gt;Not by using our current scientific approaches, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/science-as-we-know-it-cant-explain-consciousness-but-a-revolution-is-coming-126143&quot;&gt;says Philip Goff at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;who argues in favour of a kind of “panpsychism” which conceptualises consciousness as a property of all matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, the week wouldn’t be complete without some spooky Halloween links&lt;/strong&gt;. Our own &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/10/31/spook-me-please-what-psychology-tells-us-about-the-appeal-of-halloween/&quot;&gt;2014 piece on the psychology of Halloween&lt;/a&gt; has proved very popular this week; elsewhere Frank T McAndrew &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/why-do-we-like-to-visit-scary-houses-that-creep-us-out&quot;&gt;explores the appeal of haunted houses&lt;/a&gt; while Rosemary Counter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/10/28/why-do-so-many-kids-see-ghosts-we-asked-some-psychologists/&quot;&gt;asks psychologists why so many kids claim to see ghosts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you can always count on psychologists and neuroscientists to bring their A-game to Halloween decorations, as demonstrated on Twitter this week:&lt;/p&gt;

 Last month, I blogged about the famous Libet experiment and how this 1983 study, which was once heralded as undermining the concept of free conscious will, has now been reinterpreted in a less radical way.



Libet et al. found an electrical potential, the Readiness Potential (RP), that emerged in the brain about 1 second before the onset of voluntary movement. The key finding was that the RP also preceded the conscious intention to move. This seemed to suggest that the brain was 'deciding to m</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often when we discuss the replication crisis in psychology, the main focus is on what it means for the research community — how do &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/30/its-getting-increasingly-difficult-for-replication-crisis-sceptics-to-explain-away-failed-replications/&quot;&gt;research practices need to change&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, or which &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/06/theres-another-area-of-psychology-where-most-of-the-results-do-replicate-personality-research/&quot;&gt;sub-disciplines are most affected&lt;/a&gt;? These are all important questions, of course. But there’s another that perhaps receives less attention: what do the general public think about the field of psychology when they hear that supposedly key findings are not reproducible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a new paper in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/em&gt; should make for concerning reading. Across a series of studies involving a total of almost 1,400 participants, the researchers find that not only do low rates of reproducibility decrease public trust in the field, but that it may also be tricky to build that trust up again.&lt;span id=&quot;more-38338&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their first study, Tobias Wingen at the University of Cologne and colleagues gave participants a description of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/&quot;&gt;Reproducibility Project&lt;/a&gt;, a large 2015 study in which researchers attempted to replicate the results of 100 psychology findings. That project found that while 97% of the original results showed a statistically significant effect, only 36% of the replications did. But the participants in the new study were not told about these results — instead, they were asked to guess how many studies had successfully replicated.  They also rated their trust in psychology, answering questions like “I trust the psychological science community to do what is right”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, participants guessed that about 61 studies successfully replicated — much higher than the actual results of the project. But there was also a significant relationship between participants’ predictions and their trust in psychology: the lower their estimates of the number of successful replications, the lower their trust in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these data are only correlational — but a subsequent study suggested that learning about poor reproducibility actually &lt;em&gt;leads&lt;/em&gt; to lower trust. Participants again read descriptions of the Reproducibility Project, but this time they were told that a low, medium, or high number of the studies had replicated (39, 61 or 83 studies respectively). Those in the low reproducibility group subsequently rated their trust in psychology as significantly lower than those in the high reproducibility group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can this trust be regained? In further studies, the team didn’t have much luck on this front. In one, participants were given reasons for the low reproducibility rate: they were either told that it was due to researchers using questionable research practices like only publishing surprising results, or that it was because research is hard and small differences in studies can have a big impact on the findings. These participants didn’t rate their trust in psychology any differently from those who received no explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust wasn’t even any better when participants read that research practices had improved since the original project showing low reproducibility. In the final two studies, some participants were told about ways that the field has recently become more open and transparent — in one study they were even given the (pretend) results of a new project, which supposedly showed that now 83% of recent papers could be successfully replicated. But these participants still didn’t rate their trust in psychology any higher than those who only read about the original project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It perhaps won’t come as much of a surprise that replication failures can erode trust in psychology. But the more worrying finding is that that trust seems hard to repair. The researchers are at pains to highlight that their study doesn’t necessarily mean that there is no benefit in telling people the reasons behind poor reproducibility, or in explaining the ways that the field is becoming more transparent, as there could be small effects that their study didn’t pick up on. Still, they conclude, it also doesn’t provide any evidence that these strategies are effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, reading a few sentences about research practices may not be sufficient to rebuild trust: perhaps more in-depth explanation and education could be useful. But on the other hand, most members of the public probably do get their psychology education from short snippets in news reports (and blogs!), similar to those used by the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s the solution? We could just not tell people about failures to replicate — but as the authors rightly point out, “covering up low replicability is neither an ethical nor an effective way to handle the problem”. Instead, they suggest the first step may simply be to continue working on improving replicability in the field. Although it’s not yet clear whether this will have immediate effects on people’s perceptions, the study did show that the greater the rate of successful replications &lt;span&gt;in the first place, the higher people’s trust, they write. “Thus, if replicability is constantly high, public trust in psychology might rise.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550619877412?journalCode=sppa&quot;&gt;No Replication, No Trust? How Low Replicability Influences Trust in Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2019/10/31/arxiv-ng-project-explanation/"/>

		<updated>2019-10-31T12:00:25+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">
 &lt;p&gt;For arXiv to continue to provide reliable and rapid dissemination of research, our technical infrastructure needed to be modernized. As reliable as our classic system has been, its codebase and technologies have become antiquated and very difficult to maintain and extend. Over more than 20 years, it has evolved organically into a complicated monolith, comprised of disparate and sometimes unclear visions.  Trying to move such a system forward is not sustainable and would push it beyond its limits. Therefore, in 2017, we launched the arXiv Next Generation (arXiv NG) project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the goals of arXiv NG?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incrementally replace the classic system. &lt;/strong&gt;Gradually phase out components from the&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; monolithic, mostly Perl legacy codebase, by replacing them with services written in Python.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve the scaling, failure tolerance, and availability of the infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt; M&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;ove to a cloud-based infrastructure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopt open source practices to have higher engagement with external developers.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Nearly all NG code is in public GitHub repositories under &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT&quot;&gt;MIT license&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modernize user interfaces. &lt;/strong&gt;A&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;ddress critical accessibility issues and provide greater &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;compatibility with mobile devices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamline development workflows. &lt;/strong&gt;Operate on s&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;horter release cycles, enabling more (and more frequent) stakeholder feedback.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the main attributes of the architecture and its technologies?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintainability: &lt;/strong&gt;Adopt&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; mainstream, well-supported technologies, like Python, Docker and Kubernetes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolvability&lt;/strong&gt;: Move towards a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;modular, service-based architecture where “sticky” interdependencies are minimized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility: &lt;/strong&gt;M&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;ove away from a monolithic data architecture. Our data architecture should align with durability and evolvability goals, which vary across the platform.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better support for complex moderation and administrative workflows: &lt;/strong&gt;Provide &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;support for quality assurance processes and better visibility and control over the submission, moderation, and announcement processes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better API support and partner integrations: &lt;/strong&gt;A&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;dopt modern standards for data serialization, authentication and authorization, as well as documentation. Increase overall throughput of APIs, and expose valuable backend services to trusted clients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do we seek input from users about features?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we planned the arXiv NG project, we conducted a series of surveys of our users and moderators to get feedback about the issues and improvements our community wants to see. We continue to accept feature requests and bug reports &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;via &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:help@arxiv.org&quot;&gt;help@arxiv.org&lt;/a&gt; and our feedback collectors on arxiv.org, and we also seek user input from all of our stakeholders in focus groups and direct outreach during our alpha/beta testing. This feedback continues to inform our planning and priority setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do we set priorities?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things we want to accomplish to modernize our infrastructure and begin to improve for our community, so how do we prioritize what will be accomplished, how, and when? Three general rules govern how we set priorities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Impact on core mission:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; How does work effect our core mission of supporting rapid dissemination, high service reliability, durability of data, and accessibility?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Technical dependencies and technical debt:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Implementing solutions in the legacy codebase, and possibly out of sequence with arXiv NG, means that some work must be performed twice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opportunity cost:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Is timing important due to external factors, such as the need to maintain compliance with standards and regulations?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Final decisions on IT prioritization are made by the IT Lead, with direction from the Executive Director and Scientific Director, and with input from stakeholder groups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Helpful links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Jurnal Club session Shabnam Kadir will present the paper
&quot;Clique topology reveals intrinsic geometric structure in neural correlations&quot;,
by C. Giusti, E. Pastalkova, C. Curto and V. Itskov, Arxiv Prepr., pp. 1–29, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detecting meaningful structure in neural activity and connectivity data is
challenging in the presence of hidden nonlinearities, where traditional
eigenvalue-based methods may be misleading. We introduce a novel approach
to matrix analysis, called clique topology, that extracts features of the
data invariant under nonlinear monotone transformations. These features
can be used to detect both random and geometric structure, and depend only
on the relative ordering of matrix entries. We then analyzed the activity
of pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampus, recorded while the animal was
exploring a two-dimensional environment, and confirmed that our method
is able to detect geometric organization using only the intrinsic pattern
of neural correlations. Remarkably, we found similar results during
non-spatial behaviors such as wheel running and REM sleep. This suggests
that the geometric structure of correlations is shaped by the underlying
hippocampal circuits, and is not merely a consequence of position coding.
We propose that clique topology is a powerful new tool for matrix analysis
in biological settings, where the relationship of observed quantities to
more meaningful variables is often nonlinear and unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that tomorrow a catastrophe wipes out 99% of the world’s population. That’s clearly not a desirable scenario — we would all agree that a peaceful, continued existence is preferable. Now imagine that the disaster kills everyone, wiping out the human race. Most of us would rate that as an even worse occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do we see the relative severity of these different possibilities?  Is there a bigger difference between nothing happening and 99% of people dying, or between 99% and 100% of people being wiped out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://wmpeople.wm.edu/asset/index/cvance/videos&quot;&gt;thought-experiment&lt;/a&gt; was first posed by the philosopher Derek Parfit, who thought most people would believe the first difference is greater — after all, going from business-as-usual to &lt;em&gt;almost &lt;/em&gt;total annihilation is a big step. He, on the other hand, felt the second difference was greater by far: even if just a tiny fraction of humans survive, civilisation could continue for millions of years, but if humanity is wiped from the face of the Earth, then it’s all over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-50145-9&quot;&gt;a new study in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has found that, like Parfit predicted, most people don’t seem to share his view of human extinction as a “uniquely bad” catastrophe — until they are forced to go beyond their gut feeling and reflect on what extinction really means in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38322&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Stefan Schubert and colleagues at the University of Oxford surveyed 183 Americans on their opinions on human extinction. Almost 80% believed extinction would be bad, and participants also strongly agreed that human extinction should be prevented and that we have a moral obligation to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then gave 1,251 members of the British public five variations on Parfit’s thought experiment.  The first group were asked to rank the following three scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;(A) There is no catastrophe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;(B) There is a catastrophe that immediately kills 80% of the world’s population. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;(C) There is a catastrophe that immediately kills 100% of the world’s population.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Most participants ranked A as the best scenario and C as the worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then asked participants “In terms of badness, which difference is greater: the difference between A and B, or the difference between B and C?” Less than a quarter of people responded that that the difference between B and C was the greater of the two, suggesting that “most people did not find extinction uniquely bad”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest this may be because people instinctively focus on the immediate victims of a catastrophe, and the leap from no deaths to 80% seems greater than that from 80% to 100%. So for two further groups they tweaked the scenarios to encourage participants to focus less on the fact that billions of people would be dying. In one, participants read that the catastrophes would sterilise people rather than kill them, and in the other they read that the catastrophes would affect zebras rather than humans. In these cases, around 45% rated extinction as uniquely bad (that is, they rated the difference between B and C greater than the difference between A and B) — significantly more than in the first group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, encouraging participants to focus on the long-term consequences of the scenarios led to an even greater number of people seeing extinction as uniquely bad. One group was explicitly asked to consider the fact that only the extinction scenario would leave no future for humanity, while another were told that if 80% of people died, the remaining population would recover and go on to form a utopian society. In this condition more than three-quarters of participants rated the B vs C difference as the greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results suggest that although we believe human extinction is a bad thing, it’s not until we’re forced to think beyond the immediate, short-term consequences that we tend to agree that extinction is a far worse outcome than any other. This was supported by the additional finding that people were more likely to consider B vs C  as the greater difference if they scored higher on a test measuring “cognitive reflection” — the ability to override gut instinct and reflect on the answer to a question. “This could mean that deliberative thought-processes lead to finding extinction uniquely bad, whereas intuitive thought-processes lead to the opposite conclusion,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this real-world test of a philosophical thought experiment matter? We’re living in a time where climate change and technological progress puts humans at growing risk of extinction, say the researchers, yet we’re not doing enough to protect against these existential risks. The results suggest that there are cognitive biases in play that could partly explain why that’s the case, and that encouraging people to reflect more carefully might help overcome these. After all, the team conclude, “if it is right that human extinction is uniquely bad, then we should arguably invest much more in making sure it does not happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

 In a recent Retraction Watch guest post on the “Eysenck affair,” James Heathers notes the extraordinary possibility that as many as 61 Hans Eysenck publications might be retracted. I believe this figure is a significant underestimate. This reckoning has been a long time coming. The issues surrounding Eysenck’s 1980s/1990s collaboration with Ronald Grossarth-Maticek and their … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2019/10/30/61-retractions-for-controversial-psychologist-hans-eysenck-thats-a-significant-underestimate-says-his-biographer/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;61 retractions for controversial psychologist Hans Eysenck?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an ever-increasing focus on environmental sustainability, more and more of us are changing how — and what — we consume. We’re encouraged to recycle; charges on plastic mean we take our own shopping bags to the supermarket; and market research suggests that campaigns against fast fashion have been partly responsible for a rising interest in second-hand clothing. But how do these kinds of behaviours relate to our well-being? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/YC-10-2018-0867/full/html&quot;&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Young Consumers&lt;/em&gt; suggests that buying green may not be the way to personal bliss, and that instead we should be focused on curbing our materialistic urges altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38311&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how our consumer choices affect our well-being, Sabrina Helm &lt;span&gt;at the University of Arizona &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and her team &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;looked at the “culturally entrenched materialistic values” that influence millennials. The researchers were interested in two specific kinds of behaviour:  “green buying”, which refers to buying products that limit impact on the environment, and reduced consumption, which involves repairing or reusing things rather than buying replacements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team started with data from a longitudinal research program in which almost 1,000 college students completed online surveys, initially during their first year, aged 18 to 21, and subsequently three and five years later. The students completed scales measuring their level of materialism, and how often they engaged in proactive financial behaviours such as saving. The team also constructed a 7-item scale to measure proactive environmental behaviours, including both green buying — such as purchasing items made from recycled materials — and reduced consumption behaviours. Personal well-being, life satisfaction, financial satisfaction and psychological distress were also measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the results showed that the more materialistic a person was, the less likely they were to engage in reduced consumption. But they were still likely to engage in green buying — perhaps because it still involved obtaining new items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is evidence that there are ‘green materialists,'” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/10/191008155716.htm&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Helm. “If you are able to buy environmentally friendly products, you can still live your materialist values. You’re acquiring new things, and that fits into the mainstream consumption pattern in our consumer culture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These materialists should think twice, however: those with lower levels of consumption also reported higher personal well-being and lower psychological distress, but green buying had no link to well-being at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We thought it might satisfy people that they participated in being more environmentally conscious through green buying patterns, but it doesn’t seem to be that way,” Helm said. “Reduced consumption has effects on increased well-being and decreased psychological distress, but we don’t see that with green consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s &lt;span&gt;important to note that the data gleaned from the research was not causal, but merely correlational. People with higher levels of materialism may be less happy for other reasons, or happy people may be more likely to engage in reduced consumption, not the other way around. And it’s also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;possible that those with high levels of materialism are unlikely to be made any happier by reducing their consumption — after all, the factors influencing that materialism are complex and often deeply embedded in the social and cultural fabric of our lives, and undoing these desires may be slightly less straightforward than we might hope. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in consumer habits are obviously not going to be the tipping point when it comes to climate change — as we probably all know by now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change&quot;&gt;71% of global emissions&lt;/a&gt; are caused by just 100 companies. So whilst Helm notes that reduced consumption is “more important from a sustainability perspective,” how much single use plastic we purchase on a daily basis is unlikely to make a significant impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how we feel about these issues will undoubtedly develop as the clock ticks on climate change: understanding how to navigate our role in environmental issues is only going to get more pressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/YC-10-2018-0867/full/html&quot;&gt;Materialist values, financial and pro-environmental behaviors, and well-being&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;More than ever, humans need to find new ways to connect to other animals. In the United States alone, over 150 million people have a pet. There are over 10,000 zoos worldwide, with each of the larger zoos having several thousand animals. These and millions of other animals rely on humans for their survival. It wasn’t always like this. When humans were hunter-gatherers, we were immersed in animal life and had deep respect for other animals who didn’t need us to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This changed when humans began to domesticate other animals thousands of years ago. Humans are not going to become hunter-gatherers again. But does that mean we need to experience our relationship with other animals as our domesticating them, as our taking care of them? What we mostly have now are two kinds of &lt;em&gt;parent-child&lt;/em&gt; relationships with animals. One kind is the domineering parent to the submissive child. To make wild animals safe, they are made to be submissive, like “breaking” a wild mustang. The other kind is the loving nurturant parent to the dependent child…even when they are adult animals. This is the most common relationship today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there another way we can relate to animals today? Yes! We can work to be &lt;em&gt;animal whisperers&lt;/em&gt;.  How can we do this? By experiencing shared reality with them in an &lt;em&gt;adult-adult &lt;/em&gt;relationship. We have all heard about horse whisperers. The true horse whisperers signal to the horse that what matters to the horse also matters to them. Over time this builds trust. The horse and the whisperer become partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it is not just horses. Many humans have dogs whom they love and care for. But does that make them dog whisperers? Dog trainers recognize as the highest level of human–dog relationship the &lt;em&gt;adult–adult &lt;/em&gt;relationship. What is this? A dog and its human partner approach another dog. The dog wants to play with this other dog. But it first looks to check how their human partner is reacting to this other dog. Is my partner having a positive or a negative reaction to this other dog? If positive, then approach. If negative, then avoid. Importantly, the complementary situation for the human also occurs. Is my dog, my partner, having a positive or a negative reaction to this other dog? If positive, then approach. If negative, then avoid. This is an equal, adult–adult relationship where the human and the dog as partners learn from each other how to react to a third party. From the beginning, they know this third party matters to both of them. They have &lt;em&gt;shared relevance&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adult-adult relationship with another animal is not just about the animal learning to trust the human. It is about the human taking turns with their animal partner about who takes the teacher role and who takes the learner role. It is about humans trusting their animal partner as someone to learn from. And it is even more than this. In this way, humans can learn from their animal partner about what matters in the world, what in the world is worthy of attention. The humans should signal their respect for the animal, their gratitude that the animal has taught them something about the world that they did not know before. This is the kind of respect of and learning from animals that we had as hunter-gatherers. Simply put: We should say thank you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can this be done with a partner who does not have language or the knowledge that we have? Most of us have already had this experience with a partner who does not have language or the knowledge that we have…and they are called children. Most of us have experienced seeing the world in a new way with a very young child who directs our attention to something we overlooked or ignored that the child teaches us is worthy of our attention. We all know how magical that can be. And when we partner with a child to learn from that child what matters in the world, the child experiences that he or she is being respected by us, is someone we can learn from. It is no longer just a parent to child interaction. And we should thank them too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our animals can do the same for us if we treat them with respect and pay attention to what they know that we do not—creating a shared reality with them when they are the teachers and we are the learners. And we can initiate shared reality interactions by looking for and noticing what is grabbing their attention that we could learn about. Moreover, it is not just learning from pets. We can also learn from our billions of farm animals. Have you ever seen a cow jumping for joy in the fresh spring grass? It makes you appreciate fresh spring grass in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all need to become animal whisperers. That will be great for the animals. It will be great for our relationships with them. And it will be great for our learning about the world in which we live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: Image by Drew Hays via &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/u3o7il8s1Fc&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/how-to-communicate-with-animals/&quot;&gt;How to communicate with animals&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/608381440/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/608381440/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/608381440/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/608381440/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/608381440/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/608381440/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/608381440/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/608381440/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/608381440/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/608381440/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/introducing-the-nominees-for-place-of-the-year-2019/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Introducing the nominees for Place of the Year 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/brexit-when-psychology-politics-clash/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Brexit: when psychology and politics clash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/seven-events-that-shaped-country-music/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Seven events that shaped country music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 A recurring theme in evolutionary psychology is that humans did not evolve to live in the modern world. Homo sapiens emerged in the harsh conditions of small hunter-gatherer societies of the Pleistocene era. Then, in just a few thousand years, we found ourselves in a very different world of big cities, fast food and all the rest. This change happened so suddenly that evolution had no time to adapt us to the new world.



As one early evolutionary psychology text put it, “Few fear motor cars</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going home from dinner out with a friend or a Sunday family lunch, you may notice you feel slightly more full than you normally do after eating. And while some of this may have to do with how many potatoes your mum insists you eat, &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/110/4/842/5552759/?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; seems to suggest that there could be something else going on. Researchers analysing dozens of past studies on the “social facilitation” of eating have confirmed that people do tend to eat more when eating in groups than alone — and have come up with several social and psychological mechanisms that could explain our increase in consumption in company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38296&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helen Ruddock at the University of Birmingham and colleagues embarked on a meta-analysis of 42 studies on the social facilitation of eating, including experimental research, where participants were observed eating alone and with others, and non-experimental studies, where participants recorded consumption in a food diary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review confirmed past findings, suggesting that we eat more when we’re with friends or family and are more likely to moderate the way we eat when we’re with people we don’t know. In that case, rather than pigging out, we choose smaller portions and eat less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In studies using diary techniques, meal sizes were between 29% and 48% larger when eating with friends than when alone: one study found that an average of 23% more calories were consumed when eating in company. Three studies also found greater social facilitation effects for fatty and protein-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis also uncovered additional social factors that influenced how much people ate. Women tended to eat smaller portions in front of men, whether they were strangers or friends, and overweight people ate smaller portions in public for fear of being seen to overeat — one study found these groups would eat 18% less food when with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People want to convey positive impressions to strangers,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2019/10/dining-with-friends-and-family.aspx&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Ruddock. “Selecting small portions may provide a means of doing so, and this may be why the social facilitation of eating is less pronounced amongst groups of strangers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do we eat more when we’re with others? The team suggests it could be to do with the way our ancestors ate food, sharing it to protect against future food insecurity. Thousands of years on, many of us have no problem accessing food, but the mechanism remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or as the team put it, the “recent and rapid transition to a dietary landscape in which food is abundant has created forms of evolutionary mismatch… in the case of social facilitation, we have inherited a mechanism that ensured equitable food distribution but which now exerts a powerful influence on unhealthy dietary intakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more obvious social factors, too: eating with others is, simply put, fun, and we therefore receive an “enhanced reward from social eating”, leading us to potentially over-consume. Overeating in company is also viewed less negatively than doing so alone, giving us permission to eat more with others. And if you’re a regular chef for friends and family, you’re likely to associate providing food with praise, giving you a self-esteem boost and strengthening relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next time you feel guilty about overindulging with friends? Fear not — you were simply strengthening your social bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/110/4/842/5552759/?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;A systematic review and meta-analysis of the social facilitation of eating&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6064 alignright&quot; height=&quot;332&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/grandma-824867_1280-300x199.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part 6 of a series of lessons in brain health from our elders — those folk who lived the longest and healthiest. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theneuroscienceacademy.mykajabi.com/100-year-old-brain-pdf&quot;&gt;Click here to download the entire series as a PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re all dealt our unique genetic deck of cards at conception. What matters is how we choose to play our hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These wise words were spoken by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.florey.edu.au/science-research/scientist-directory/professor-anthony-hannan&quot;&gt;Professor Tony Hannan&lt;/a&gt;, Head of the Epigenetics and Neural Plasticity Laboratory at the Florey Institute in Melbourne. His focus is on understanding how genes (nature) and the environment (nurture) contribute to the healthy brain and to specific brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re trying to work out a little more about the complex interactions between genes and the environment, and how this translates into susceptibility to neurological and psychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannan and I first met in Oxford, where he was a postdoc working a few doors along the hall from my dusty ground floor corner lab. He was also delving into the new frontier of nature, nurture and brain plasticity research alongside renowned neurobiologist Colin Blakemore. During this time, Hannan worked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://sci-hub.tw/10.1038/35008142&quot;&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt; that had the human gene for Huntington’s disease (HD) embedded into their DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, HD is a brain disease passed down from parent to child that causes uncontrollable dance-like or jerking movements (chorea), dementia and depression. Up until that point, Huntington’s was considered to be 100 % genetically-determined but Hannan delayed the onset of the disease with environmental enrichment. The environmental enrichment Hannan is referring to is scientist-speak for rodent housing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to their cousins in the wild, lab animals live rather minimalist, unstimulating lives with basic access to food, water and nesting material. Animals in the wild survive by foraging for food and those most adept at outsmarting their predators and competing for resources thrive. It’s reasonable to consider control laboratory animals as ‘couch potatoes’ that, compared to rodents in the wild, are sedentary, overeat and experience little cognitive challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simulate life in the wild, Hannan spilt his HD mice into two groups. Half maintained their couch-potato existence, and half were moved to live in environmentally enriched conditions with access to tunnels, ladders, blocks, mazes and running wheels. Hannan says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discovered that giving this increased sensory and cognitive stimulation and physical exercise delayed the onset of Huntington’s disease in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannan’s startling discovery was the first to demonstrate the benefits of enriching experiences on the progress of HD, ‘the epitome of genetic brain diseases’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Education is equivalent to environmental enrichment in lab animals.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years spent in formal education is a potential predictor of cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overwhelmingly, the evidence shows that people who attend university undergo a slower cognitive decline in older age, and are less likely to develop AD. Someone who left school at 15 will show poorer cognitive performance in old age compared to someone who stayed at university and gained a graduate degree. Although there is recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25516261&quot;&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; about cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Certain kinds of challenging jobs also have the potential to enhance and protect the brain.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So another way to maximise your cognitive prowess is to work as a doctor, air traffic controller, financial analyst or in some other mentally-demanding profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635733&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; analysed 4182 retirees who’d worked in a wide variety of jobs and had been doing the same type of work for roughly twenty-five years before they retired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mental requirements of the job e.g. analysing data, developing objectives and strategies, making decisions, solving problems, evaluating information and thinking creatively, were matched assessed alongside each retiree’s mental functioning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retirees who had worked in jobs with greater mental demands were more likely to have better memories before they retired, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; more likely to have slower declines in memory after retiring than people who had worked in jobs with fewer mental demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is cognitive reserve?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work, education or any type of intellectual enrichment that involves a lot of thinking, analysing, problem-solving, creativity and other complex mental processing help build ‘cognitive reserve’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive reserve refers to the brain’s resilience or ability to cope despite damage or degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Yaakov Stern, one of the earliest proponents of the notion, explains,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people with a high degree of cognitive reserve, AD pathology will still occur, but people are somehow able to compensate for that damage. Some won’t ever be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s because they don’t present any symptoms. Some individuals have a greater number of neurons and synapses, and somehow those extra structures provide a level of protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does that leave you if you’re not a university-educated air traffic controller with a side gig in medicine? Is it ever too late to build cognitive reserve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the answer is ‘no’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intellectual enrichment goes beyond education and employment.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2014 Mayo Clinic report found that engagement in cognitively stimulating activities two or three times a week after the age of sixty-five, such as reading books and magazines, playing games or music, artistic activities, craft, group activities, social activities and computer activities, all help. Engaging in these activities at least three times a week during mid- and later life will help delay the onset of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannan’s discovery was published in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://sci-hub.tw/10.1038/35008142&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;in 2000 and paved the way for hundreds of studies since extolling the virtues of exercise and cognitive challenge to enhance neuroplasticity, and prevention or treatment disease and injury. He hopes the new discoveries in the field of neuroplasticity have implications for how each of us may protect our brain from the relentless weathering of ageing and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

Brexit was supposed to be about sovereignty but it is really about ownership and taking back control as championed by the political populism that is sweeping across the Western world. Most people aren’t populists but they can easily become so. One reason is uncertainty for the future, which makes people more inclined toward the far right. In their &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062696199/can-it-happen-here/&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the current political environment, psychologists Karen Stenner and Jonathan Haidt concluded that a third of adults across Europe and the US were predisposed to authoritarianism, while 37% were non-authoritarian and 29% were neutral. However, when we feel we are under threat or perceive that our moral values are being eroded, we seek reassurance from leaders who articulate strong, resolute visions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hypothesis received support in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB689GB690&amp;amp;q=Kakkara,+H.+and+Sivanathan+In.+(2017),+%E2%80%98When+the+appeal+of+a+dominant+leader+is+greater+than+a+prestige+leader%E2%80%99,+Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences,+114,+6734%E2%80%93+9.&amp;amp;spell=1&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq47Xb9aflAhVUoXEKHe4DCF4QBQgtKAA&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 140,000 voters, across sixty-nine countries over the past two decades, which revealed that those experiencing the greatest economic hardship voted for populist candidates unless they reported a strong personal sense of control. However, economics still does not explain why the populists also received the support of the predominantly rich, white males for whom hardship was not a primary concern. Ronald Inglehart, a political scientist, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cultural-evolution/34F637928AB1AA87B6409C28B4DFC9F5&quot;&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; that, in addition to economic inequality, we are witnessing the effects of a “silent revolution” backlash brewing among the older generation, who see social changes in the younger generation as a threat to their traditional values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/trump-brexit-and-rise-populism-economic-have-nots-and-cultural-backlash&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the shifting political landscape, Inglehart discovered that the economic hardship account could not explain all the data he analysed from the demographics of voters for 268 political parties in 31 European countries. A silent revolution would explain why older members of society vote for populist politicians. Each generation wants to take back control of the values they hold most dear from the current generation who they believe are squandering them. Inglehart concludes that “these are the groups most likely to feel that they have become strangers from the predominant values in their own country, left behind by progressive tides of cultural change which they do not share.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voters are also unduly fearful of the future. In virtually all the key dimensions of human well-being life is much better than it was only a few hundred years ago. And yet most of us think the world is going to hell in a handcart. This is a phenomenon known as declinism– the belief that the past was much better than the present. Most citizens in prosperous countries &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/317051/enlightenment-now-by-steven-pinker/&quot;&gt;overwhelmingly believe&lt;/a&gt; that the world is getting worse. Declinism is a distorted perspective that plays into the hands of right-wing politicians who stoke the fires of nationalism and protectionism. The reasons for declinism are many, from various biases in human cognition (including rose-tinted nostalgia and the tendency to pay greater attention to future dangers, especially if you are already wealthy) to fact that bad news gets more coverage than optimism. Social media amplify these concerns by providing a constant stream of unfiltered perspectives and biases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declinism explains why extreme actions and politicians seem warranted when you hold unreasonable fears for the future. In 2012, YouGov &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/%20articles-reports/2012/02/07/%20britains-nostalgic-pessimism&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that most UK citizens they surveyed thought that since the Queen’s coronation in 1953 Britain had changed for the worse, with the greatest proportion endorsing this negative view among the over sixties.  However, when the pollsters asked whether the quality of life for the average person had improved, respondents overwhelmingly agreed that it had. People can objectively recognize better healthcare, better education, and a better quality of life but this does not translate into an appreciation that things are getting better overall. When asked whether the world was getting better just before the Brexit referendum, only 11% thought the future would be better, with 58 per cent saying that it was getting worse. Again, the older participants were, the more pessimistic their responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Brexit comes down to tribalism and ownership. The trouble with ownership is that we become irrational when we feel threatened by loss. Who we are is not simply our bodies and minds, but our property, our relationships, our jobs, our opinions and our beliefs. And if someone threatens to take any of them away, we fight to keep control even when it is not in our best interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured image credit:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;“EU United Kingdom” by Elionas2 via &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/illustrations/eu-united-kingdom-2016-problem-1473958/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixabay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/brexit-when-psychology-politics-clash/&quot;&gt;Brexit: when psychology and politics clash&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/608241682/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/608241682/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/608241682/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/608241682/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/608241682/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/608241682/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/608241682/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/608241682/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/608241682/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/608241682/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/how-brexit-may-have-changed-parliament-forever/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How Brexit may have changed Parliament forever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/introducing-the-nominees-for-place-of-the-year-2019/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Introducing the nominees for Place of the Year 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/brexits-challenge-maritime-security/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Brexit’s challenge to maritime security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recent review has found that there are many good reasons to be humble&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/21/health/psychology-humility-pride-behavior.html&quot;&gt;writes Benedict Carey in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. People who score higher on humility are more curious and open-minded, for instance, and less aggressive towards people with different beliefs.&lt;span id=&quot;more-38284&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can the same joke have one person in hysterics but leave another just rolling their eyes?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/the-mystery-of-what-makes-a-joke-funny-but-only-to-some-people-125769&quot;&gt;Sophie Scott explores why humour is so subjective&lt;/a&gt; over at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re surprisingly adept at concentrating on a single person’s speech when there are other conversations going on around us — a phenomenon known as the “cocktail party effect”.&lt;/strong&gt;  Now a new study has revealed what’s going on in the brain as we filter out these distracting sounds to focus on a single speaker, &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1733395/how-the-brain-listens-to-one-voice-could-improve-hearing-aids/&quot;&gt;Katherine Ellen Foley reports at &lt;em&gt;Quartz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; work that could one day help develop better hearing aids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We all have that friend who plays fast and loose with the facts in their conversations. But why do they do it?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2019/oct/25/inside-the-mind-of-the-bullshitter-science-weekly-podcast&quot;&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Guardian’s &lt;/em&gt;“Science Weekly” podcast&lt;/a&gt;, Ian Sample talks to psychologists who are trying to understand the mind of the bullshitter (and check out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/22/the-results-are-in-from-the-first-study-of-what-encourages-and-deters-people-from-bullshitting/&quot;&gt;Digest piece&lt;/a&gt; on a paper from one of the podcast guests, John Petrocelli).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claims that social media is “destroying a generation” are misplaced,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/social-media-has-not-destroyed-a-generation/&quot;&gt;writes Lydia Denworth at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The story takes a look at some of the the flaws of early research into the effects of digital technology &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; and explores how researchers are now attempting to conduct more rigorous studies that get into the nuances of media use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finally, babies appear to have some kind of sense of counting long before they can actually count out loud, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/children-can-understand-counting-years-earlier-than-previously-believed/&quot;&gt;according to this story on &lt;em&gt;BBC Science&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Focus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers found that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;even 14-month-olds seem to understand that particular number words are associated with specific quantities. Scroll down to the end of the piece for an adorable video of the research.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/10/OpenScienceBlog-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;By Sara Rouhi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Director of Strategic Partnerships, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Open Access Week draws to a close, I find myself reflecting on my brief time so far at PLOS — how six months fly by! — and what I understand “open” to mean now compared to when I started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS’ position as an early adopter of the APC business model, and the pioneer of the “megajournal,” proved to a generation of publishers that there was a real need for new means and avenues to publish and read — a demand that accounts for the astronomical&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2018/01/10/future-oa-megajournal/&quot;&gt; growth&lt;/a&gt; of PLOS ONE 2006-2014 (all&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/09/open-access-megajournals-lose-momentum-publishing-model-matures&quot;&gt; predictions&lt;/a&gt; of megajournal decline aside). Along with others, we helped set the stage for the mainstream conversation we are having about OA in the scholarly communication sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with most of the OA conversation now dominated by the notion of a &lt;em&gt;transition&lt;/em&gt; to OA, what does this mean for those native OA publishers, like us, who are already OA, and have been for years? If our focus as an organization is to “ensure that research is discoverable, accessible, and useful…to create a more &lt;strong&gt;equitable system&lt;/strong&gt; of scientific knowledge and understanding…” (emphasis mine), are we done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My six months at PLOS has shown me that the answer is definitively NO. Being “open” has to evolve beyond Open Access in order to stay aligned with the PLOS mission. As Dr. Katie Corker commented in her closing&lt;a href=&quot;https://cos.io/blog/open-science-is-a-behavior/&quot;&gt; remarks&lt;/a&gt; at the&lt;a href=&quot;https://improvingpsych.org/&quot;&gt; SIPS&lt;/a&gt; conference in 2018,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I want us to think hard about classifying Open Science as a &lt;strong&gt;behavior&lt;/strong&gt;. Not as an identity. Not as a value. It is a set of practices that you do in order to make your work transparent to others, checkable and scrutinizable by others in the community.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critical to this set of practices is making publishing itself accessible and maximally inclusive and, as we have been noting for some time, &lt;strong&gt;APCs are not that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next stage of Open Access has to include models and research objectives that remove barriers to both access AND being published. If authors, or their research budgets, have to pay APCs we are always leaving critical communities out in the cold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early-career &lt;a href=&quot;https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/16-things-about-ecrs/&quot;&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; (or their budgets) can’t always afford APCs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many fields don’t receive grant funding that can cover APCs. (Hello, humanities/social sciences!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Funding and publishing practices in other parts of the&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/08/08/amelica-before-plan-s-the-latin-american-initiative-to-develop-a-cooperative-non-commercial-academic-led-system-of-scholarly-communication/&quot;&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; don’t align with Open Access as modeled by the Global North, meaning many researchers globally do not have the funds to participate in author-funded models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Open for whom?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity in&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openaccessweek.org/&quot;&gt; Open Access&lt;/a&gt; is exactly what publishers should be examining as we continue to evolve our ideas around open. As I said at the SSP New Directions&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lisalibrarian/status/1179413329292464128&quot;&gt; Seminar&lt;/a&gt; in October, “”If APCs are the end point [of this current transitional period fueled by Plan S], we’ve made reading open and publishing closed.” This is not the end point we hoped for and not the end point we should settle for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As PLOS asks “What next?” regarding open, we are going back to our roots and re-examining the business models and vehicles that can make it all happen and keep it sustainable. &lt;em&gt;Open for whom?&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;open how?&lt;/em&gt; These are the questions at the core of our considerations, and we are examining a mixed economy as part of our future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the challenges we (and most other native OA publishers) face are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this time of transition, we don’t have anything to “flip.” Our content is already open and closing it is obviously not an option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have no existing subscription legacy pricing (and hence no immediate base from which to derive new kinds of pricing that are not APC-based).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;APCs cannot cover the cost of higher selectivity. Bigger publishers can afford to have journals that lose money because their larger stable of offerings can simply balance things out. But PLOS only has seven journals (even if ONE happens to be among the biggest in the world…).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Models that we are already exploring are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bundled APCs — lump sums for annual recurring spend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;While, yes, this is still fundamentally an APC model, it is in high demand by institutions like the California Digital Library and European consortia, helps free authors from feeling it is their responsibility to manage payments, and may finally free us all from the phrase “author pays”!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Journal supporter-based models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A collective action model where group of institutions share the cost for supporting a subset of journals — this is particularly suitable for our more selective journals PLOS Biology and PLOS Medicine. The challenges around this model are not small — it has to have the right combination of incentives and “consequences” to make it compelling to participants (especially as many organizations cannot pay for something that’s already free). We’re working on identifying that combination of carrots and sticks and have great library partners helping us on this (so thank you!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transitional models — bridge funds to give us time to pilot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are exploring partnerships with other funders and publishers to maintain near-term revenue while piloting. While not a particular model in itself, it underscores the importance of trialing and piloting things to get it right and understanding that maybe the next model is one we haven’t thought of yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, these are exciting times for me, PLOS, and all those who are still committed to evolving Open Access. I hope this is enough to pique your interest in what PLOS is exploring to address equity in open knowledge. Please continue to watch this space, and please don’t hesitate to reach out to me at the email below if you are at an institutional library, or other organization, and feel you can help us move towards the new business models that will keep open access evolving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the theme of OA week itself can imply OA is not yet for everyone, we know we are not done.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/10/OpenScienceBlog-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Pa9&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 8.0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;A9&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 9.5pt;&quot;&gt;Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Publisher, Open Research, PLOS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: the following perspective was published as part of Digital Science’s annual survey and report,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalscience.figshare.com/articles/The_State_of_Open_Data_Report_2019/9980783&quot;&gt;The State of Open Data 2019&lt;/a&gt; ,&lt;/strong&gt; to coincide with global celebrations around Open Access Week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest barrier to research data sharing and reuse seems to be a matter of trust, and in particular trust in what others may do with researchers’ data if it is made openly available. The 2019 State of Open Data survey revealed that more than 2,000 respondents had concerns about misuse of their research data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about data misuse represent a multitude of issues; fears that errors could be found in their work, or that the data could be misinterpreted or research participant privacy be compromised. Researchers might also be concerned that their data will be reused for purposes they did not intend, such as commercial exploitation, or for misleading or inappropriate secondary analyses.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2019 survey provides insights from one of the largest pools of respondents ever, but this particular barrier – concerns about misuse of data – should not come as a surprise. It is supported by several previous surveys which, when combined, total many thousands of researcher opinions.1,2,3,4 With such compelling evidence that these researcher concerns exist, there is an ever-more important need to explore why they persist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical problems, including where, how and when to share research data, have received much attention.5,6 However, concerns about misuse, alongside the potential to lose publication opportunities (“fear of being scooped”), or going against the more conservative data sharing culture in their own field of research often feature amongst researchers’ top concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features of technological solutions, such as the ability to share data privately in repositories before publication, and policy-level support for researchers’ reasonable first use of their data8 go some way to addressing this issue of trust. However, trust is more a matter of culture than technology. With repositories being used by around a quarter of researchers9,10 investing in people rather than infrastructure may be a more pressing issue to change research culture, as Dr Marta Teperek, who coordinates one of the largest institutional data stewardship programmes at TU Delft in the Netherlands, has concluded.11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in skills and training for individual researchers is one possible solution, although Professor Barend Mons has argued that data stewardship, like computer programming, is too specialist a task to expect all researchers to undertake. He recommends that universities provide one data steward for every 20 researchers.12 Like most difficult problems, there is rarely a single solution. Experimentation and collaboration are essential if we are to enable researchers to build greater trust in the power of data reuse to advance science – in the same way that the unbridled reuse of content helped grow the world wide web so rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholarly publishers have made good progress in the first step towards changing research culture to support data sharing by raising awareness through the implementation of journal research data policies in the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At PLOS we have invested significantly in people and processes to support a strong journal data sharing policy since 2014.13 We are seeing a steady increase year-on-year in the proportion of PLOS authors who use a data repository.14 Although less costly for publishers, journal policies that only encourage data sharing have much lower levels of compliance.15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many papers subject to a journal data sharing policy now published it is possible to explore actual data sharing behaviours, and the benefits of sharing, at a large scale. A study of more than half a million PLOS and BMC papers found that researchers who stored their data in a repository were associated with an average 25% increase in citations to their research papers.16 This is important given that the 2019 survey suggests that a full citation to research papers remains the strongest incentive for researchers to share their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While more publishers must invest further in data sharing support for researchers, we should be encouraged by collaborations between publishers and other stakeholders to enable data sharing to be more effective and rewarding. In 2019 the STM Association is collaborating with a Research Data Alliance initiative to implement consistent journal data sharing policies.17 There are indications from some large publishers that they will focus on strengthening journal policies, signalling the importance of a greater commitment than only encouraging data sharing, or “data available on request”. As publishers, we can help to build trust with researchers by being open ourselves: open with our content; our data; our policies; and open with our own data sharing insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are undoubtedly costs associated with implementation of strong policies and solutions for data sharing but, to paraphrase Dr Jean- Claude Burgelman at September 2019’s CODATA Beijing conference, open science is ultimately an investment, not a cost.18 Open science, and indeed open research, is an investment in creating more reliable and reusable knowledge for the future. While data sharing culture and fears over misuse of data persist in today’s research environment, with so many organizations invested in finding innovative solutions to the problems that prevent optimal data sharing, we can remain optimistic that these barriers will ultimately be broken down in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
