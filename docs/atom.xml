&lt;p&gt;For me, dreams and creativity have always been wound tightly together. As a teenager leafing through my dad’s &lt;i&gt;Heavy Metal&lt;/i&gt; comic strip anthologies, it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Nemo&quot;&gt;Little Nemo in Slumberland&lt;/a&gt; (about a character who has fantastic dreams) that stunned me the most. When I became a psychology researcher, I was fascinated with altered states and formed a short-lived dream research group with my fellow PhD students – somnambulant life seemed so mysterious, and the then-received wisdom that dreams were just brain static was becoming untenable. Today, outside of my science hours, I perform improvisational theatre, most intensively with The Dreaming, a surrealistic troupe mimicking dream-logic. And in recent years, I’ve made my sporadic dream-logging into a habit (tip: keep a voice recorder by your bed and capture everything you can without worrying about sense or structure). Could this habit make me more creative? According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jocb.168/full&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Creative Behavior&lt;/i&gt;, it could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-29424&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with my own sense that dreams feed creativity, there are a number of anecdotes that press the same message: Mendeleev’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/02/08/mendeleev-periodic-table-dream/&quot;&gt;discovery of the periodic table&lt;/a&gt;, Elias Howe’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_Howe%23Invention_of_sewing_machine_and_career&quot;&gt;conception of the lock-stitch sewing machine&lt;/a&gt;, Descarte’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://physics.weber.edu/carroll/honors/descarte.htm&quot;&gt;road to the scientific method&lt;/a&gt; and James Cameron’s ideas for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/james-cameron-came-up-terminator-during-dream-2015-6&quot;&gt;The Terminator&lt;/a&gt;, were all apparently inspired by dreams. What’s more, evidence suggests that greater dream recall is correlated with measures of creativity. This could simply be because creative people remember their dreams better (maybe finding them more interesting). To show that dream recall actually benefits creativity you really need an experimental setup, which is just what Mauricio Sierra-Siegert and his team at the Colegiatura Colombiana attempted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers asked their undergraduate sample to twice complete a measure of creativity, 27 days apart. The measure, the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking, involves working ambiguous visual fragments into full pictures, which judges then rate for their creative content. For example, someone might work a couple of isolated curves into the number eight, a snowman, or an intricate snaking hydra with faces depicting different political figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days between the assessments, 55 of the participants spent time each morning writing up the dream content they could remember from the night before. A 32-strong control group wrote instead about a vivid event from the previous day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning and end of the study, the participants also reported how often they remembered their dreams. Those in the dream condition who started out remembering the fewest dreams – the bottom third of the group – showed an increase, from remembering one dream a month to one a week on average, suggesting that the dream diary exercise had been effective (the lowest scorers on dream recall in the control group also showed an increase during the course of the study, perhaps due to “regression to the mean”, but their increase was not as great as that shown by participants in the dream condition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did keeping a dream diary lead to a creativity boost? The Torrance test of creativity can be scored in terms of “raw” features like the volume of ideas, degree of extra details, and abstractness of titles of the drawings, and although the dream loggers showed an improvement in these raw scores, so did the control group (and indeed, so too did a third, non-intervention group who simply took the test twice, suggesting a benefit to performance owing simply to practice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the test can also be scored by evaluating more closely the content of the images, rating qualities such as the degree of emotional expressiveness, presence of narrative to the imagery, humour, richness of imagery and presence of fantasy. These are the sort of creative elements commonly associated with dreams, and indeed, the dream-logging participants showed improvements in their creative content scores whereas the control participants did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By repeatedly bringing their waking-state attention back to the workings of dream consciousness, Sierra-Siegert and his colleagues suggest the participants in the dream diary condition were encouraging a “cross-fertilization” between the two modes, making more accessible the creative leaps and elaboration common to dreams. Repeated referral to dream content similarly characterised the explorative leaps of the surrealists, and many of our most distinctive film-makers, from David Lynch to Christopher Nolan, blend or explore elements across these boundaries to create their work. If you desire to be creative along these lines, it seems worth paying attention to what your dream life has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

 Earlier this week I tweeted a link to a Quora post which, I felt, was rather silly. The post was a response to the question &quot;Are people with very high IQs generally happy?&quot; and it answered in the negative:
Let’s say high IQ is a blessing which comes with a terrible price. And each and every person with reading east from 135 has paid that price.

HIgh IQ persons usually have also extremely vivid and wide spectrum of emotions and emotional life, and when they are happy, they are in rapture, and</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cortical neurons receive balanced excitatory and inhibitory synaptic
currents. Such a balance could be established and maintained in an
experience-dependent manner by synaptic plasticity at inhibitory
synapses. We show that this mechanism provides an explanation for the
sparse firing patterns observed in response to natural stimuli and fits
well with a recently observed interaction of excitatory and inhibitory
receptive field plasticity. The introduction of inhibitory plasticity
in suitable recurrent networks provides a homeostatic mechanism that le
ads to asynchronous irregular network states. Further, it can
accommodate synaptic memories with activity patterns that become
indiscernible from the background state but can be reactivated by
external stimuli. Our results suggest an essential role of inhibitory
plasticity in the formation and maintenance of functional cortical
circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skipping your morning coffee before a lecture or an important meeting is probably a bad idea, according to new research. Of course you will be less alert, but more than that, the research team at the University of Tasmania say that the cravings you experience will impair your ability to memorise new information. Reporting their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09658211.2017.1282968&quot;&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Memory&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers also found that their participants were unaware of how caffeine cravings had affected them – suggesting that if we try to learn things when desperate for a coffee we are at risk of being overconfident about what we’ve taken in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-29343&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants were 55 regular coffee drinkers (average age 30 years) who drank at least one coffee per day and who at least sometimes found themselves thinking about when they will get their next caffeine fix (another 11 participants were excluded because they didn’t describe experiencing these feelings often enough).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memory challenge was to learn 100 unrelated word pairs, such as POND-BOOK. Following this, the participants were tested on their ability to recall the second word in each pair (given the first word). They were also tested on their recognition memory, which involved selecting the correct second word for each pair from a multiple-choice list of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most important, before the memory challenges began, half the participants were placed in a state of craving. They’d been asked to refrain from any coffee that day, and then they were teased cruelly with a &lt;span class=&quot;hw&quot;&gt;cafetière&lt;/span&gt; of coffee, which they poured into a cup, but were not allowed to drink. They were also encouraged to pay attention to the smell and colour of the drink. The other participants acted as controls – they drank coffee as usual earlier that day, and they poured themselves a jug of water and imagined their favourite holiday (this was to give them a task that was fairly similar to the craving induction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The control participants significantly outperformed the caffeine craving participants on both recall and recognition memory. “Cravings trigger consumption schemas and the inhibition of these schemas requires cognitive resources, leaving fewer resources available for other cognitive tasks,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another detail is that the participants had been asked to estimate how well they thought they would do at the two kinds of memory test. The judgments of the caffeine craving participants were adversely affected – they were less able to judge the accuracy of their answers than the control participants and this meant they were more overconfident in their upcoming performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A weakness of the study is that there was no baseline control group of non-coffee drinkers, who were not craving coffee but also hadn’t had the benefit of coffee. This means it’s possible the results can be explained by coffee’s memory enhancing effects, rather than coffee craving having detrimental effects. However, Matthew Palmer and his colleagues who conducted the research think this is unlikely since findings for caffeine having memory enhancing effects have been mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09658211.2017.1282968&quot;&gt;Caffeine cravings impair memory and metacognition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 Commensal bacteria are believed to have important roles in human health. The mechanisms by which they affect mammalian physiology remain poorly understood, but bacterial metabolites are likely to be key components of host interactions. Here we use bioinformatics and synthetic biology to mine the human microbiota for N-acyl amides that interact with G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We found that N-acyl amide synthase genes are enriched in gastrointestinal bacteria and the lipids that they encode interact with GPCRs that regulate gastrointestinal tract physiology. Mouse and cell-based models demonstrate that commensal GPR119 agonists regulate metabolic hormones and glucose homeostasis as efficiently as human ligands, although future studies are needed to define their potential physiological role in humans. Our results suggest that chemical mimicry of eukaryotic signalling molecules may be common among commensal bacteria and that manipulation of microbiota genes encoding metabolites that elicit host cellular responses represents a possible small-molecule therapeutic modality (microbiome-biosynthetic gene therapy).

 Studies on the distribution and evolution of organisms on oceanic islands have advanced towards a dynamic perspective, where terrestrial endemicity results from island geographical aspects and geological history intertwined with sea-level fluctuations. Diversification on these islands may follow neutral models, decreasing over time as niches are filled, or disequilibrium states and progression rules, where richness and endemism rise with the age of the archipelago owing to the splitting of ancestral lineages (cladogenesis). However, marine organisms have received comparatively little scientific attention. Therefore, island and seamount evolutionary processes in the aquatic environment remain unclear. Here we analyse the evolutionary history of reef fishes that are endemic to a volcanic ridge of seamounts and islands to understand their relations to island evolution and sea-level fluctuations. We also test how this evolutionary history fits island biogeography theory. We found that most endemic species have evolved recently (Pleistocene epoch), during a period of recurrent sea-level changes and intermittent connectivity caused by repeated aerial exposure of seamounts, a finding that is consistent with an ephemeral ecological speciation process. Similar to findings for terrestrial biodiversity, our data suggest that the marine speciation rate on islands is negatively correlated with immigration rate. However, because marine species disperse better than terrestrial species, most niches are filled by immigration: speciation increases with the random accumulation of species with low dispersal ability, with few opportunities for in situ cladogenesis and adaptive radiation. Moreover, we confirm that sea-level fluctuations and seamount location play a critical role in marine evolution, mainly by intermittently providing stepping stones for island colonization.

 &lt;p&gt;
 The pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases is poorly understood and there are few therapeutic options. Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive neuronal dysfunction and loss, and chronic glial activation. Whether microglial activation, which is generally viewed as a secondary process, is harmful or protective in neurodegeneration remains unclear. Late-onset neurodegenerative disease observed in patients with histiocytoses, which are clonal myeloid diseases associated with somatic mutations in the RAS–MEK–ERK pathway such as BRAF(V600E), suggests a possible role of somatic mutations in myeloid cells in neurodegeneration. Yet the expression of BRAF(V600E) in the haematopoietic stem cell lineage causes leukaemic and tumoural diseases but not neurodegenerative disease. Microglia belong to a lineage of adult tissue-resident myeloid cells that develop during organogenesis from yolk-sac erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) distinct from haematopoietic stem cells. We therefore hypothesized that a somatic BRAF(V600E) mutation in the EMP lineage may cause neurodegeneration. Here we show that mosaic expression of BRAF(V600E) in mouse EMPs results in clonal expansion of tissue-resident macrophages and a severe late-onset neurodegenerative disorder. This is associated with accumulation of ERK-activated amoeboid microglia in mice, and is also observed in human patients with histiocytoses. In the mouse model, neurobehavioural signs, astrogliosis, deposition of amyloid precursor protein, synaptic loss and neuronal death were driven by ERK-activated microglia and were preventable by BRAF inhibition. These results identify the fetal precursors of tissue-resident macrophages as a potential cell-of-origin for histiocytoses and demonstrate that a somatic mutation in the EMP lineage in mice can drive late-onset neurodegeneration. Moreover, these data identify activation of the MAP kinase pathway in microglia as a cause of neurodegeneration and this offers opportunities for therapeutic intervention aimed at the prevention of neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases.

 Human glioblastomas harbour a subpopulation of glioblastoma stem cells that drive tumorigenesis. However, the origin of intratumoural functional heterogeneity between glioblastoma cells remains poorly understood. Here we study the clonal evolution of barcoded glioblastoma cells in an unbiased way following serial xenotransplantation to define their individual fate behaviours. Independent of an evolving mutational signature, we show that the growth of glioblastoma clones in vivo is consistent with a remarkably neutral process involving a conserved proliferative hierarchy rooted in glioblastoma stem cells. In this model, slow-cycling stem-like cells give rise to a more rapidly cycling progenitor population with extensive self-maintenance capacity, which in turn generates non-proliferative cells. We also identify rare ‘outlier’ clones that deviate from these dynamics, and further show that chemotherapy facilitates the expansion of pre-existing drug-resistant glioblastoma stem cells. Finally, we show that functionally distinct glioblastoma stem cells can be separately targeted using epigenetic compounds, suggesting new avenues for glioblastoma-targeted therapy.

 Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) are a promising source for a cell-based therapy to treat Parkinson’s disease (PD), in which midbrain dopaminergic neurons progressively degenerate. However, long-term analysis of human iPS cell-derived dopaminergic neurons in primate PD models has never been performed to our knowledge. Here we show that human iPS cell-derived dopaminergic progenitor cells survived and functioned as midbrain dopaminergic neurons in a primate model of PD (Macaca fascicularis) treated with the neurotoxin MPTP. Score-based and video-recording analyses revealed an increase in spontaneous movement of the monkeys after transplantation. Histological studies showed that the mature dopaminergic neurons extended dense neurites into the host striatum; this effect was consistent regardless of whether the cells were derived from patients with PD or from healthy individuals. Cells sorted by the floor plate marker CORIN did not form any tumours in the brains for at least two years. Finally, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography were used to monitor the survival, expansion and function of the grafted cells as well as the immune response in the host brain. Thus, this preclinical study using a primate model indicates that human iPS cell-derived dopaminergic progenitors are clinically applicable for the treatment of patients with PD.

 Beyond the more common chemical delivery strategies, several physical techniques are used to open the lipid bilayers of cellular membranes. These include using electric and magnetic fields, temperature, ultrasound or light to introduce compounds into cells, to release molecular species from cells or to selectively induce programmed cell death (apoptosis) or uncontrolled cell death (necrosis). More recently, molecular motors and switches that can change their conformation in a controlled manner in response to external stimuli have been used to produce mechanical actions on tissue for biomedical applications. Here we show that molecular machines can drill through cellular bilayers using their molecular-scale actuation, specifically nanomechanical action. Upon physical adsorption of the molecular motors onto lipid bilayers and subsequent activation of the motors using ultraviolet light, holes are drilled in the cell membranes. We designed molecular motors and complementary experimental protocols that use nanomechanical action to induce the diffusion of chemical species out of synthetic vesicles, to enhance the diffusion of traceable molecular machines into and within live cells, to induce necrosis and to introduce chemical species into live cells. We also show that, by using molecular machines that bear short peptide addends, nanomechanical action can selectively target specific cell-surface recognition sites. Beyond the in vitro applications demonstrated here, we expect that molecular machines could also be used in vivo, especially as their design progresses to allow two-photon, near-infrared and radio-frequency activation.

		<link href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/YKl-ndFh_cE/nature23654"/>

 &lt;p&gt;
 Modern ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) comprise half of extant vertebrate species and are widely thought to have originated before or near the end of the Middle Devonian epoch (around 385 million years ago). Polypterids (bichirs and ropefish) represent the earliest-diverging lineage of living actinopterygians, with almost all Palaeozoic taxa interpreted as more closely related to other extant actinopterygians than to polypterids. By contrast, the earliest material assigned to the polypterid lineage is mid-Cretaceous in age (around 100 million years old), implying a quarter-of-a-billion-year palaeontological gap. Here we show that scanilepiforms, a widely distributed radiation from the Triassic period (around 252–201 million years ago), are stem polypterids. Importantly, these fossils break the long polypterid branch and expose many supposedly primitive features of extant polypterids as reversals. This shifts numerous Palaeozoic ray-fins to the actinopterygian stem, reducing the minimum age for the crown lineage by roughly 45 million years. Recalibration of molecular clocks to exclude phylogenetically reassigned Palaeozoic taxa results in estimates that the actinopterygian crown lineage is about 20–40 million years younger than was indicated by previous molecular analyses. These new dates are broadly consistent with our revised palaeontological timescale and coincident with an interval of conspicuous morphological and taxonomic diversification among ray-fins centred on the Devonian–Carboniferous boundary. A shifting timescale, combined with ambiguity in the relationships of late Palaeozoic actinopterygians, highlights this part of the fossil record as a major frontier in understanding the evolutionary assembly of modern vertebrate diversity.

 Paediatric solid tumours arise from endodermal, ectodermal, or mesodermal lineages. Although the overall survival of children with solid tumours is 75%, that of children with recurrent disease is below 30%. To capture the complexity and diversity of paediatric solid tumours and establish new models of recurrent disease, here we develop a protocol to produce orthotopic patient-derived xenografts at diagnosis, recurrence, and autopsy. Tumour specimens were received from 168 patients, and 67 orthotopic patient-derived xenografts were established for 12 types of cancer. The origins of the patient-derived xenograft tumours were reflected in their gene-expression profiles and epigenomes. Genomic profiling of the tumours, including detailed clonal analysis, was performed to determine whether the clonal population in the xenograft recapitulated the patient’s tumour. We identified several drug vulnerabilities and showed that the combination of a WEE1 inhibitor (AZD1775), irinotecan, and vincristine can lead to complete response in multiple rhabdomyosarcoma orthotopic patient-derived xenografts tumours in vivo.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/08/sugar-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a really small fraction of us gets through a normal day without adding sugar to its standard meal. Just think about it for a second… Soft drinks, candies, cakes, cookies, pies, fruit drinks, desserts and milk products (ice cream, sweetened yogurt), even pasta…we are submerged by sugar-enriched food. Although obesity is undoubtedly a complex and a multifactorial metabolic disorder, increased sugar intake is considered one of the fundamental and principal factors of the current worldwide obesity epidemic.&lt;br /&gt;
A compelling body of evidence strongly suggests that high-sugar consumption results in profound neural alterations in critical brain regions involved in reinforcement and determining incentive salience of palatable food. In fact, the rewarding properties of sugar can modulate the activity of the brain reward system, the same neural pathway which is activated by drugs such as cocaine and amphetamine. The mesolimbic reward circuit is a collection of highly interconnected brain nuclei including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the amygdala that encodes emotional states such as anticipation of reward and motivation. Long-term consumption of highly palatable food can cause maladaptive modifications within the brain reward pathway. Modified cell morphology, altered synaptic plasticity and imbalanced neuronal homeostasis have been described following consumption of palatable food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intermittent access to sugar alters the amygdala &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among several brain regions, the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a specific nucleus of the amygdaloid complex, is known to influence reward learning and the association with adaptive, goal-directed and emotional behaviors. The BLA receives dopaminergic input from the VTA and sends glutamatergic projections to the medium spiny neurons in the NAc, a key structure of the mesolimbic reward circuit. In a recent study published in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0183063#pone.0183063.ref057&quot;&gt;PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;, Shariff and colleagues (Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia) decided to examine the effect of short- and long-term binge-like sucrose consumption on the morphology of the BLA principal neurons using an intermittent-access two-bottle choice paradigm. Two bottles, one containing water and the second one containing 5% (w/v) sucrose, were presented simultaneously to the animals using a binge-access protocol. Surprisingly, the authors found that the total spine densities of BLA principal cells were not affected by binge-like consumption of sucrose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the authors sought to investigate whether sugar consumption was able to alter the general structure of the dendritic components of the BLA principal neurons. “&lt;em&gt;Given that BLA principal cell apical dendrites receive distal glutamatergic inputs that play a pivotal role in the formation of emotional and associative memories, it is interesting to note that our study revealed significant restructuring of apical distal branches&lt;/em&gt;”, point out Dr. Bartlett, the senior author of the paper. In fact, decreased dendritic arbor length of principal neurons from the basolateral amygdala was detected in both short- and long-term sucrose consuming rats, thus suggesting a structural remodeling of BLA circuits. However, “&lt;em&gt;whether long-term sucrose induced reductions in dendritic length and branching of BLA principal neurons (…) are associated with reductions in their excitatory activity and neuronal output is an interesting possibility that warrants further investigation&lt;/em&gt;”, report the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sugar and drugs of abuse &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same laboratory has previously reported that sugar consumption triggers a reduction of total dendritic length and an increase in distal spine density in the medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnbeh.2016.00054/full&quot;&gt;Klenowski et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;). This kind of cellular and morphological hallmarks have been also observed in response to chronic exposure to drugs of abuse such as alcohol, cocaine and amphetamines. Interestingly, different studies have also shown that not only drugs of abuse but also a high-fat diet attenuates dendritic spine density as well as decreased inhibitory synaptic transmission in the prefrontal cortex, a key region intricately involved with processing reward and motivation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26983815&quot;&gt;Dingess et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28042870&quot;&gt;Thompson et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;). “&lt;em&gt;Taken together&lt;/em&gt;”, report the authors, “&lt;em&gt;this suggests the possibility of overlapping neural pathways for drugs of abuse and certain foods types&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must be pointed out that comparing sugar to drugs of abuse is a simplistic short-cut. Indeed, natural rewards (sugar) and drugs of abuse (cocaine, amphetamine, etc) may share some common neuronal features, but the big picture is much more complex. In fact, it is also noteworthy that exposure to various drugs of abuse as well as various types of stress can cause an increase in distal spine density in the BLA principal neurons. This difference between sugar- and drug-induced structural modifications may indicate that both rewards (sugar vs drugs) may impact different aspects of the neuronal homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future studies are definitely needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying food reward, thus hopefully leading to a better understanding of food-related maladaptive behaviors such as obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

 Apparently people read this blog and have noticed I’ve not updated in a few months. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2kk7is/science_ama_series_we_are_neuroscience_professors/clmaqqz&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;People are all like&lt;/a&gt;, “hey man, what happened to your bloviating?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here’s the (shocking!) gist: moving to a new city, starting a faculty job, writing a book, having a second child, and creating a new class from scratch has been somewhat time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My burgeoning lab has just been renovated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WNP0xPrVA-M/VGThChZT0HI/AAAAAAAAGiM/xxIPNpWXWS8/s1600/voytek_lab_reno.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WNP0xPrVA-M/VGThChZT0HI/AAAAAAAAGiM/xxIPNpWXWS8/s1600/voytek_lab_reno.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Voytek lab: pre-renovation (L) and post-renovation (R)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I’ve got one post-doc (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.robotpuggle.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Erik Peterson&lt;/a&gt;) working with me, two PhD students with two more rotating, and one more post-doc joining in early 2015. I’m the diversity chair for Cognitive Science and a diversity committee member for neuroscience (positions I take very seriously and is a topic near and dear to my heart). I’m constantly busy playing catch up, trying to finish up my post-doctoral research while also trying to establish my scientific independence and build my own lab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where does that leave me now that I’m a few months in?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mentorship is difficult, and I’m trying to do well by my trainees. As a mentor there’s a balance between giving guidance and providing freedom, and I’m still learning that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I (very amicably and somewhat sadly!) resigned my position as data scientist at Uber, mostly because I was too busy and, between my family, my lab, and Uber, something had to give and it wasn’t going to be my family or my lab. So my nearly four-year-long side career in helping build out a multi-billion dollar multi-national company has come to an end (and I could write a whole book about that, probably).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That decision lead me to reassess life and career choices yet again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently gave a talk at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tedxsandiego.com/events/2014-chain-reaction/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TEDxSanDiego&lt;/a&gt; about failure, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2014/03/the-passion-trap.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“passion trap”&lt;/a&gt;, and the narratives we tell ourselves. We love a good narrative, and for the past 10 years my personal narrative has been one of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ketyov.com/2013/11/laziness-and-being-academic-batman.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;failed student&lt;/a&gt; reformed as a neuroscientist. That’s mostly the narrative I’ve shared here on this blog. But I want to make sure I’m not getting caught up in my own narrative and that I don’t pigeonhole myself into a particular way of thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Uber thing was partially an attempt at pushing myself outside of my comfort zone and away from my neuroscience narrative. Same with writing the zombie book (&lt;i&gt;Do Zombies Dream of Undead Sheep?&lt;/i&gt; now available for sale &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Zombies-Dream-Undead-Sheep-Neuroscientific/dp/0691157286/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Technology/Do-Zombies-Dream-of-Undead-Sheep-Audiobook/B00PG1W4ZC&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;audiobook on Audible&lt;/a&gt; BUY IT NOW). In fact, when I’m presented with a new opportunity, one of the major factors in my decision making is, “how weird/novel is this opportunity?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I’ve made several deviations in my career but I keep coming back to neuroscience research. I’m just a few months into the tenure-track, and while it’s been a hell of a thing, I have little doubt that I’ve made the right choice. While I’m working a lot, I’m still able to hold evenings and weekends as protected family time, with most weekends spent with my kids at musea, the beach, the zoo, and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is all just a bunch of words to put down on here to excuse my absence so I can get back to writing other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vlOD0G2bD6k/VGTjHw8gIBI/AAAAAAAAGiY/KcKYD3Xrxqg/s1600/voytek_g_beach.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vlOD0G2bD6k/VGTjHw8gIBI/AAAAAAAAGiY/KcKYD3Xrxqg/s1600/voytek_g_beach.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Scientists, publishers, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/body/reproducibility-explainer/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;journalists&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and the public talk of the problem of reproducibility in experimental science. There are committees, symposia, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/8/341/341ps12.full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;peer-reviewed articles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, blogs and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mbio.asm.org/content/7/6/e01902-16.full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;opinion pieces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; documenting the issue and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001438&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exploring remedies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to the challenge of reproducibility. NPR science correspondent Richard Harris takes this societal challenge one step further in his book with a title that in no uncertain terms calls attention to the root cause of the reproducibility challenge—&lt;em&gt;Rigor Mortis: How Sloppy Science Creates Worthless Cures, Crushes Hope and Wastes Billions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-7697&quot; height=&quot;260&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/08/Richard-Harris-headshot-227x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;197&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS interviewed Harris about the lack of rigor in experimental research that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/04/06/522262881/how-flawed-science-is-undermining-good-medicine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he describes in his book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and from a discussion that covered materials standards, publishing fewer papers with greater confidence, text and data mining and the cultural shift required to improve the rigor in science, one unifying theme emerged—tension. Tension between evaluation and culture, hands-on training and coursework, between making work public and ensuring its reliability, and between responsible reporting and satisfying the needs of a news organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These lines of tension contribute to the current structural rigidity in the culture of science that, according to Harris, make scientific rigor a difficult challenge to address. As he delved into biomedical sciences in 2014 after nearly a decade reporting on climate change and the environment, Harris took a broad look at the state of the research enterprise and asked, what are the consequences of limited funds on the structural influences supporting the current state of academic biomedical research?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Evaluation and Culture&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest obstacles influencing rigor, according to Harris, are the “underlying cultural issues” that confront science. He cites the financial crunch, career pressures and the hyper competitiveness of science, particularly in biomedical sciences, as examples. These are, he thinks, also the hardest problems to solve. “Even if you poured huge amounts of new money into biomedical research this problem would not go away quickly. It’s changing a mindset.” Fundamentally the “incentives are misaligned,” says Harris, to reward numbers of papers and how many of them are published in high profile journals, rather than “careful work where one is highly confident in results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Hands-on Training and Coursework&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the point of experimental responsibility, Harris’ book follows a path of practical recommendations to improve scientific rigor, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve experimental design and provide methods training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Validate cell lines, antibodies, gene constructs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply appropriate statistical analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disclose experimental and analytical methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his research for the book, Harris was quite surprised to find out how little formal training there is in experimental methodology, particularly in biomedical research. He did note, however, that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-GM-16-109.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NIH is now funding attempts to develop curriculum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, following an unsuccessful search to find the best training courses in the country to replicate. There is “huge room for improvement” in this area, he says, but how to integrate this into a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://loop.nigms.nih.gov/tag/rigor-and-reproducibility/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;training program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;? Changing a system that’s already in place to accommodate that is difficult, especially without reward and recognition for faculty teaching those courses. “Should it start more robustly at the end of the undergrad career?” One potential solution discussed during the interview is for post-docs to teach these courses to incoming graduate students, as part of a summer or first-quarter orientation program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Making Work Public and Ensuring Reliability&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps can be taken to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6216/1452.full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;improve the situation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, researchers with grants from the National Institutes of Health are required to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-011.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;authenticate the cell lines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; used in their work. “There’s no simple solution to be imposed from top down, it needs to also work bottom up,” says Harris when considering what key additional recommendations the community might consider. “&lt;strong&gt;Young scientists are more open to sharing and that leads to transparency, that helps solve some of the issues.”&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not a silver bullet but it improves things if people can put their data out there, he says. Increased &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002506&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sharing and transparency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; addresses a number of these issues, and “to the extent that the culture of the young scientist is open to that, that’s great. Although it’s hard for them to change the culture, but over time this can help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “more nimble publication system might encourage scientists to publish confirmatory or negative results,” Harris states. When asked specifically about the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005473&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;role of preprints&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/scicomm/2017/08/14/science-connected-accessible-science-communication/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;alternative forms of science communication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, he acknowledges that experiments in openness and transparency are interesting although it’s unclear how successful they will be. Will that additional literature be less reliable, he wonders? “It’s the job of the entire community, not simply the scientist who makes a claim, to figure out what’s right and what’s wrong,” he says, when discussing the viable options of prepublication sharing of work and use of blogs and commenting as forums for peer review. However, as a science journalist, he ponders: “Do we want more literature out there or do we want more strict checks and less literature? Personally, I would like to see less literature, have people &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/113/34/9384.full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spend more time thinking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; about what they’re doing and being sure they’re right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Responsible Reporting and News Flow&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science journalists can help the issue of scientific rigor, acknowledges Harris. “They should step back from doing the story of the day&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;It takes more time to think about things from a broader perspective, but that’s more important than ever.” Science journalists must find a balance between that and satisfying the needs of their news organizations. Even an award-winning science correspondent like Harris admits that he needs to think differently about how he does his job on a day to day basis. “Look at what’s published and fits into the broader trend and context of similar results, and what it means elsewhere,” he recommneds. These are results that should be the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172650&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;focus of science journalists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Easing the Tug of War&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that many institutions now evaluate candidates for jobs and promotions based on a set limit of publications, chosen by the author to best represent their contributions to science. Additional efforts to broaden evaluation within the constraints of the existing scientific culture include recognition and credit for reagent validation, peer review activities and training others on experimental responsibility.

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a stake in the current structure of the scientific enterprise, says Harris, from journals caring about impact factors [&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/research-assessment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS de-emphasizes journal impact factors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;] to deans making sure scientists draw in funding and overhead for their institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The biomedical research enterprise is driven by economics; economic systems are much harder to change and that should be something the overall enterprise should be thinking about—how to rethink that.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris believes clinical medicine in the 1990s experienced similar cultural stresses, but &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2016/09/16/clinical-trials-sharing-of-data-and-living-up-to-our-end-of-the-bargain/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a web-based resource from the National Library of Medicine that provides public access to information about clinical studies and the availability of experimental drugs, got people “past some of these issues without making them rethink their place in the scientific universe.” Hopefully academic biomedical research can do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;****************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Harris, science correspondent for National Public Radio (NPR) received the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aaas.org/news/winners-named-2010-aaas-kavli-science-journalism-awards&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2010 Kavli Science Journalism Award&lt;/a&gt; from the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) for his &lt;a href=&quot;http://showcase.casw.org/the-envelope-please/diving-deep-oil-spill/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reporting on BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill&lt;/a&gt; in the Gulf of Mexico. He also received the award in 1988 and 1995. He currently covers biomedical sciences with a focus on investigative stories and in 2014 completed an eight-part series examining the stresses on biomedical research in the US caused by fluctuating funding levels.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Our gut feeling rarely lets us down, although we know very little about how it happens. As science discovers more about the connection between the gut and brain, the role of the little-known and rare enterochromaffin (EC) cells becomes central to our understanding of how the brain and gut communicate. We have all felt butterflies or that wrenching feeling in our stomach when we are &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/08/20/the-brain-gut-axis-part-3-the-gut-microbiota-in-disease/&quot;&gt;anxious&lt;/a&gt;, and we also know that long term anxiety and depression often leads to various disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. We have known for some time about that our mental state can affect the gut, and what we are discovering now with the help of modern research is how gut health affects the brain and general well-being. These days, it seems that what has been missing from this cyclic relationship is our understanding of EC cell functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Basic features of the gut-brain axis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fully appreciate the role of EC cells, we have to delve into some basic underlying concepts and facts. Our gut has more neurons than our spine or peripheral nervous system—that is why it is also known as &lt;em&gt;the second brain&lt;/em&gt;. These neurons have various functions, like controlling gut motility, protecting against irritants (through increased motility or vomiting), and many other still to be understood functionalities. These gut neurons mostly work independently from the brain, but when required, they send information and get feedback from the brain, thus functioning as a closed loop often called the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/08/19/the-brain-gut-axis-part-2-brain-gut-microbiota-communication/&quot;&gt;gut-brain axis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EC cells play a vital part in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/08/18/the-brain-gut-axis-part-1-a-paradigm-shift-in-neuroscience/&quot;&gt;gut-brain axis&lt;/a&gt;. These cells have receptors that are always listening to various activities in the gut and sending feedback to the brain and other neurons of the gut through chemical messengers or hormones. Although EC cells have functional similarities to glands, they are spread all over the digestive tract, and they form about one percent of the gut epithelium. Although one percent may sound small, EC cells secrete more than 30 kinds of hormones and neurotransmitters (this number will likely increase as more are identified). In fact, they secrete more than 90% of the body’s serotonin, a neurotransmitter well-known for its role in various mental states, including mental disorders like depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it is well understood that the communication between the brain and gut is double-sided, forming a loop. Thus, mental distress causes gut disorders, and gut disorders may influence mental states. Moreover, EC cells have a critical role in this entire axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Brain and GI disorders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress is known not only to cause GI disorders, but it also makes the symptoms worse. Stress and psychological factors change the movement of the GI tract, worsen inflammatory processes, and even increase susceptibility to various infections. In all of these processes, EC cells play a crucial role. The release of serotonin from EC cells is the key mechanism for controlling the motility of the gut. They can be stimulated due to local irritation, as well as through nerve supply, especially the vagus nerve. Therefore psychological therapy has a special place in treating functional GI diseases, along with pharmaceutical therapy. EC cells are highly sensitive to the effect various chemical compounds like detergents and spices. They have been demonstrated to even have olfactory receptors—yes, the same receptors that are present in our nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gut and brain disorders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the effect of mental stress on GI function has been known for ages, in recent times there has been increased interest in better understanding the influence of gut health on the brain. This became particularly important after research demonstrated that EC cells not only have an indirect influence on nerves through &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/04/phobias-part-ii-new-social-anxiety-treatments-mdma-testosterone-less-serotonin/&quot;&gt;serotonin&lt;/a&gt;, they also seem to have direct links with neurons. Thus, EC cells appear to be directly connected to the brain. This means that changes in the gut are transmitted to the brain in milliseconds, and not in seconds or minutes as previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fact gains further importance, considering that the vagus nerve (the main nerve connecting the brain and GI) has more afferent fibers (those sending a signal to the brain) than efferent fibers (those sending a signal from the brain to organs). These afferent fibers cause feelings like nausea when you eat the wrong kind of food. The role of these vagal signals from the GI to the brain and their relationship with other aspects of health are being investigated, like arousal, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/10/26/understanding-chronic-fatigue-syndrome/&quot;&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, and poor regulation of body temperature, and may become the target of future therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Treatment strategies targeting the gut-brain axis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many drugs for mental distress like depression have been used effectively to treat gut disorders. Inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most prevalent of such disorders. Some researchers even call it a “mental disorder of the gut”. Selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have shown increasingly important roles in the management of this disorder. SSRIs help to control overactive EC cells. The role of SSRIs is not limited to the treatment of IBS. Their role is being studied in various functional diseases of the GI, in controlling nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, and many other disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, the same SSRIs that are used to treat mental health issues are being used to deal with GI problems. However, many clinical researchers are studying non-absorbable serotonergic agents for GI disturbances. Further studies are being done to target &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/06/11/serotonin-and-behavior/&quot;&gt;tryptophan hydroxylase&lt;/a&gt;, a precursor for the synthesis of serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of EC cells in gut functioning is being investigated in depth to better understand and treat disorders of the brain like dementia, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/05/06/preventing-alzheimers-disease-interview-with-dean-sherzai-of-cedars-sinai/&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, Parkinsonism, and autism. As we learn more about EC cells, we might be able to treat many medical illnesses more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A psychiatry journal has retracted a 2011 paper exploring the use of ketamine to treat patients with severe depression following an investigation at Yale University. According to the retraction notice, Yale determined that the paper, published in the International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, did not accurately describe the research. But the study’s lead author, Gregory Larkin, […]&lt;/p&gt;

 In April 2016, an FDA committee voted not to recommend acceptance of eteplirsen, a drug designed to treat muscular dystrophy. In September, however, the FDA did approve the drug, following a heated internal debate.



This wasn't the end of the story, however. What followed was an unusual scientific controversy that played out in the peer-reviewed literature, discussed in a Retraction Watch post this week.

		<link href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/08/25/soda-drinks-sugary-or-not-are-damaging-to-the-brain/"/>
		<id>http://brainblogger.com/?p=22763</id>
		<updated>2017-08-25T15:40:32+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;People who consume more than one diet soda a day are nearly three times more likely to develop dementia or stroke. Surprisingly, no such association was found for sugared drinks. These are the latest findings from a study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Stroke&lt;/em&gt; on the 20th of April 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study comprised of more than 4000 participants enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort. Dietary intake of sugared drinks and artificially sweetened drinks were recorded at 3 different time points over 10 years. Participants were followed up for another 10 years and were observed for the development of stroke or &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/07/14/prevention-is-the-best-medicine-for-dementia/&quot;&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the association between artificial sweeteners and the risk of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/20/can-stroke-be-prevented-by-lifestyle-changes/&quot;&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; or dementia were not influenced by potentially confounding factors, such as age, gender, smoking status, physical activity levels, and total calorie intake. Despite this, the researchers concluded that pre-existing &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/08/19/link-between-diabetes-and-alzheimers-disease/&quot;&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or hypertension may be partially to blame for the correlation between artificial sweeteners and dementia. However, it is unclear if patients with these conditions could in fact be consuming more artificial sweeteners in an attempt to reduce sugar intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the abovementioned study fuels emerging concerns that artificial sweeteners may not be the ‘safe alternative’ to &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/03/why-sugar-is-so-addictive/&quot;&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;. As the first study to associate diet sodas to dementia, it underscores the potential harm that artificial sweeteners may have on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderate amounts of glucose are important for ensuring proper brain function. As the only source of energy for brain cells, glucose is responsible for powering neurons and for producing neurotransmitters that are vital for neuron to neuron signalling in the brain. Brain cells that support and maintain the neurons, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/02/03/the-many-emerging-roles-of-astrocytes/&quot;&gt;astrocytes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/04/12/microglia-part-1-definitions-and-developmental-progression/&quot;&gt;microglia&lt;/a&gt;, also depend on glucose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurons are exquisitely sensitive to drops in glucose levels. Epileptic syndromes have been ascribed to neurons that are deficient for a protein called glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1), rendering brain cells unable to draw up glucose from the blood. Neurological conditions such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/07/26/nurturing-the-brain-part-11-magnesium/&quot;&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt;, strokes, and traumatic brain injury all have a component of altered glucose metabolism in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the coin, too much of a good thing is never a good idea. Excessive sugar intake induces a myriad of diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2009/03/26/metabolic-syndrome-and-cognitive-decline/&quot;&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, dental problems, and many others. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2011–2014, half of all adults in the U.S. drank at least one sugary beverage a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is behind our seemingly innate attraction to sweetness? The concept of ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/03/why-sugar-is-so-addictive/&quot;&gt;sugar addiction&lt;/a&gt;’ has stemmed from observing binging, withdrawal, and craving-like behavior in rats that were exposed to sugar. The current theory holds that intermittent, excessive sugar consumption causes altered neurochemical transmissions (one of them being a large release of the neurotransmitter dopamine) in the nucleus accumbens, the brain’s feelgood center. These brain changes are strikingly similar to those that occur in response to addictive drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excess amounts of sugar may also predispose us to developing brain diseases. Another study, which also utilized the data from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort, discovered that people who drank two sugary drinks a day had lower total brain volume, smaller hippocampal volumes (an area of the brain responsible for forming &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/12/11/using-magnets-on-the-brain-to-bring-back-memories/&quot;&gt;memories&lt;/a&gt;), and poorer memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given mankind’s insatiable appetite for sugar, artificial sweeteners were introduced to help the masses limit their sugar intake. Also known as low calorie sweeteners, FDA-approved artificial sweeteners include aspartame, neotame, acesulfame-K, sucralose, and saccharin. Low calorie sweeteners can be up to 13,000 times sweeter than regular sugar but with a fraction of the calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, evidence has sprung up rebutting the perceived beneficial health effects of artificial sweeteners. A large systemic review of 37 studies on these sweeteners revealed that increased intake actually resulted in increased weight and waist circumference, as well as higher occurrences of type 2 diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, artificial sweeteners and regular sugar act differently on the brain. Brain scans of people who sipped regular sugary drinks showed stronger activation of more regions involved in reward centers compared to those who sipped drinks with sweeteners. This means that artificial sweeteners may not be as satisfying as regular sugar, leaving a person craving for more sweet foods that ultimately leads to a higher total calorie intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these factors are especially worrying when taking into consideration the estimated 1 in 4 children and 2 in 5 adults who consume low calorie sweeteners on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that artificial sweeteners do more harm than good? The jury’s still out on that one, as artificial sweeteners are helpful in certain populations, like diabetics.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly how parents shape their children is a matter of controversy, especially since Judith Rich Harris’ book &lt;em&gt;The Nurture Assumption&lt;/em&gt; popularised the behavioural genetics position that the “shared environment” (so-called because it’s shared by siblings) – including the family home and parents’ methods of upbringing – has scant influence on how children turn out. But the debate is far from settled, and now a team chiefly from Florida State University has investigated whether more educated parents produce offspring with particular personality characteristics. &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-11240-001&quot;&gt;Published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the research identifies a number of personality differences that correlate with parental education, and the researchers suggest the causes of this association must be more than just genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-29319&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Andrea Sutin, is the largest and most focused investigation of personality and parental education to date, drawing from seven surveys, one of students and the rest wide-scale public surveys, for a total of over 60,0000 surveyants. The data included personality measures (these differed per study, but all mapped directly on to the so-called Big Five traits), and the years spent in education by each parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence showed that child personality was associated with parents’ levels of education. More educated parents were more likely to have offspring who scored higher in trait Openness to Experience across almost every survey, and in the bulk of the samples more education was also associated with higher Extraversion and lower Neuroticism. A way to integrate and make sense of these three associations is that children of the more highly educated are more relaxed, outgoing and explorative; they are oriented to approaching the world rather than avoiding it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The links between parental education and children’s personality were mediated by three factors that also give some insight into the reasons behind it all. First, parental education was associated more strongly with kids’ personality in families where the kids were also more highly educated. An obvious explanation for this finding would be that children’s personality is shaped by their own more intense education, however, previous research has found only weak evidence for this. It seems to me an alternative, if partial, explanation is that greater parental education usually has a beneficial effect on a child’s personality, but when a child withdraws from education much earlier than their parents – deviating from a script – this may indicate that they have more turmoil in their life, either as a cause or consequence of their educational decisions, and this may disrupt the personality benefits otherwise bestowed by an educated parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second mediating factor was children’s IQ in adolescence. That is, greater parental education correlated with their children having higher IQ in adolescence, and in turn, higher adolescent IQ correlated with higher Openness and Extraversion and lower Neuroticism. We already know that higher IQ leads to better executive functioning, and the adoption of better coping strategies in response to stress, so these could contribute to personality traits that indicate greater confidence to address the world and handle problems. And in principle, parents’ education could benefit their children’s IQ in adolescence due to factors like an enriched environment earlier in development, or differential levels of nutrition or disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third mediating variable was effect was familial income. Parental education was more strongly associated with children’s personality when the parents were richer. So it may be that the association is partly due to the fact that more educated parents tend to have wealthier families, giving their children a financial cushion against risk and stress, and providing more opportunities and experiences to broaden the mind and cultivate engagement in the world. But as with the other mediators, wealth didn’t fully explain the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we need to take stock and consider the elephant in the room: the genetic explanation. The observed associations between parental education and children’s personality (and the mediating factors) could all be explained by a gene complex passed between parent and child that shapes intelligence and personality in parent and child, and that encourages the pursuit of education, and facilitates higher lifetime income through the generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this possibility, Sutin and his colleagues traced 545 people in the surveys who were raised by adoptive parents, people for whom we should not expect to see these personality differences if they were due purely to genetics. But the adoptees showed personality associations with parental education that were similar and in some cases stronger than in the main group – such as (adopted) maternal education having a significantly greater association with Openness. This means that genetics cannot be the driving explanation for these associations, which adds to a corpus of recent research that challenges the behavioural genetic consensus on the irrelevance of the “shared environment” to fundamental psychological traits like personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, there was also a beneficial developmental turn to the observed patterns. As the children of the more educated grew older – and many surveys provided data on these children beyond middle age and even into their nineties – they showed even more pronounced increases in Openness and Extraversion and a drop in Neuroticism, relative to children of the less educated. Summoning a comparison to the “cognitive reserve” – the notion that some people seem to maintain good mental functioning into older age even when suffering from neuropathology – Sutin’s team suggest that parents’ education may be bestowing a “personality reserve” in their children that helps them to resist the turn away from exploration that aging encourages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study doesn’t indicate a single definitive mechanism to explain why parental education is linked with children’s personality, and it’s likely that there are even more processes at that the researchers didn’t look into, such as the known association between lower Neuroticism / higher Openness and breastfeeding, an activity more common in more educated mothers. It seems likely that greater parental education provides their children with a constellation of benefits. And while there may be a genetic contribution, the adoption data suggests that the environment provided by educated parents may itself be shaping their children’s personality development. Identifying “always nurture” as a misleading assumption was an important step forward in psychology; for progress to continue, it looks like “never nurture” also needs to be consigned to history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-9456&quot; height=&quot;594&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/Overall-1st-place-Podocnemis-expansa-by-Ana-Carolina-Lima--300x209.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;852&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your profession?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m doing a Ph.D. in Biology and Ecology of Global Change at the University of Aveiro, Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What type of research are you involved in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an aquatic ecologist with broad interests in conservation ecology, environmental impact and ecosystems management with emphasis on rivers associated with large dams. My research priority has been balancing the benefits of renewable resources represented by hydroelectric power, river fisheries, and biodiversity conservation. I have worked with fish communities affected by dams from different bioclimatic regions in Portugal, Brazil, and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you become interested in this area of research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I can remember, natural ecosystems have always fascinated me. It was a natural career choice becoming a biologist. When I realized how endangered our natural ecosystems were becoming I decided to pursue a Ph.D. in biology and ecology of global change. I am now increasingly interested in building bridges between science and policy-making, applying environmental legislation and participating in policy development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you become interested in photography?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first years of University, I began to feel the urge to capture the beauty of the natural world around me. It later became a serious hobby and after a few photography courses, I carry my camera everywhere I go, whether it’s traveling for leisure or for work. I feel very lucky because being a researcher in ecology has allowed me to travel to natural places not many people have the opportunity to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where and how was this photo taken?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo was taken in one of the most important areas of conservation for the Giant South American turtle (&lt;em&gt;Podocnemis expansa&lt;/em&gt;), also known as the tartaruga-da-amazônia in the Cantão State Park, in Tocantins, Brazil. The Park is located in the Brazilian “Savanna” or Cerrado, a biodiversity hotspot that although it is yet poorly known it is thought to be equally or even more biodiverse than the Amazon ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why were you there at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was there as part of a research group working in the field and helping to collect data on the status of reptiles and amphibians’ populations for conservation purposes during my Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you explain a bit more about the image?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image is from a group of juveniles Giant South American turtles (&lt;em&gt;Podocnemis expansa&lt;/em&gt;) which were being counted, measured and weighed during field-work for research purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about this scene particularly interested you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scene was fascinating because I was in the middle of field-work, helping other researchers to collect data, which made this moment really special, not only for the aesthetic part but also for the important conservation work we were doing.&lt;/p&gt;

This mission seeks to alleviate many global challenges – including poverty, hunger, disease, shelter limitations, equality, education and sustainability of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union (EU) sought to address  the extent of these problems by 2015. A key aim has been to see a reduction in the number of deaths caused by tuberculosis (TB). This infectious disease is a public health concern, as one third of the global population is thought to be infected with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to global health initiatives, the UN aimed to see a 50% reduction in death rates caused by TB by 2015, in comparison to figures from 1990. Marieke J. van der Werf, Sandro Bonfigli and Frantiska Hruba  from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecdc.europa.eu/en&quot;&gt;European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control&lt;/a&gt;, Granitsväg, in Stockholm investigated whether these milestones were actually reached, so that we can prepare for the next steps to further improve global health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4544-9&quot;&gt;recently published&lt;/a&gt; article in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, by obtaining data from the Eurostat database, the researchers analyzed cause of death statistics for populations belonging to all 28 countries of the EU. Looking at the time frame of 1999-2014, it appeared that TB death rates had decreased by 50%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add to this promising news, ‘the annual average percentage decline’, which shows how fast the fatality percentage  declines from year to year, was a surprising 2.73%. This result was more than what was necessary for them to reach their target.This positive news shows that the EU has successfully reached its MDF goal of reducing TB fatalities in its member countries. Though, what hope do we have for the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, a new goal has been constructed by the&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/tb/post2015_strategy/en/&quot;&gt; World Health Organization.&lt;/a&gt; They raise the bar to ambitious levels, using figures from 2015 for comparison against a target for a 35% reduction in tuberculosis fatality by 2020, and a 95% drop by 2035. The authors comment that this will cause heavy demand on governments and health care services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other parts of the world are setting such objectives too. The General Assembly of the United Nations set out a list of goals to cease various global health problems by 2030, including as the TB epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reliably assess how the world copes with its public health initiatives, appropriate data collection and research will become increasingly important as we step into the public health challenges of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

		<id>http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/?p=9356</id>
		<updated>2017-08-24T10:00:58+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/registered-620x204-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are Registered Reports?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under this format, peer review of an article is split into two distinct stages. In stage 1, a paper is submitted and assessed &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; data is actually collected; manuscripts contain only an Introduction and Methods section (along with any relevant pilot data). This allows reviewers to focus purely on assessing the clarity of the scientific question being asked, the feasibility of the proposed methodology to answer it, and the rigor of proposed analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a paper passes stage 1 review, authors are offered ‘in principle acceptance’ indicating that the article will be published pending successful completion of the study. Once data has been collected, results analysed, and conclusions drawn, papers enter stage 2 of the review process. Reviewers assess whether the approved research protocol has been adhered to and whether the conclusions drawn are justified by the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a research question is worth asking, the answers are worth publishing – whatever they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For full details of how Registered Reports work (for both authors and reviewers) please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/about/registered-reports&quot;&gt;our website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why use Registered Reports?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several potential benefits to this novel approach to peer review. For one, it removes any temptation on behalf of reviewers and editors to judge a study purely on the perceived novelty or importance of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much has been written about the negative ramifications of such an approach; both the possibility of methodologically lacking but ‘sexy’ studies being published, and the potential for methodologically strong studies with ‘negative’ results to struggle to be considered (or simply be kept in the file drawer). Registered Reports are focused on the idea that if a research question is worth asking, the answers are worth publishing – whatever they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Registered Report format also reduces any temptations (whether conscious or not) on the behalf of researchers to change their research hypothesis post-hoc to match their eventual results. The field of ecology is perhaps especially prone to such conscious or unconscious ‘harking’; ecological research often involves an initial explorative approach leading to observational and correlational evidence that can be potentially tweaked to support multiple hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is of course also a benefit to researchers in receiving feedback on their methodology while it is still possible to make adjustments. In the traditional review process, when researchers are presented with that overlooked weakness in their methodology it is all too late; their time (and limited funding) has been wasted on a flawed project. With Registered Reports, researchers can fine-tune their protocols with the benefit of expert feedback before setting out to gather the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecologists as a field have shown considerable enthusiasm for innovations in peer review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why &lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registered Reports are not a new idea. Or at least not that new; over 50 journals, in a wide variety of biomedical fields, have begun to accept the format in recent years. Just within BMC, our sister journals &lt;em&gt;BMC Biology&lt;/em&gt; and (from today) &lt;em&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/em&gt; accept Registered Reports (you might be interested in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-biology/2017/05/03/scientific-odyssey-pre-registering-voyage/&quot;&gt;eloquent explanation&lt;/a&gt; by the then Chief Editor of &lt;em&gt;BMC Biology&lt;/em&gt; of her thoughts on the benefits of Registered Reports).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However &lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/em&gt; is the first journal within the BMC-series to consider Registered Reports; more importantly, we are also the first dedicated ecology journal to do so. Why do we feel the field of ecology is a good place to trial Registered Reports? Partly it is because ecologists as a field have shown considerable enthusiasm for innovations in peer review; for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peerageofscience.org/&quot;&gt;Peerage of Science&lt;/a&gt; and (the sadly now defunct) &lt;a href=&quot;https://axiosreview.org/&quot;&gt;Axios Review&lt;/a&gt; were heavily driven by ecologists (and both were strongly supported by &lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this suggests that ecologists find the novelty-based criteria used by many journals to be an increasingly large drain on their time and are keen to look for ways to get their work published in a quicker and fairer way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_7620&quot; style=&quot;width: 4330px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Josef Settele&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-7620&quot; height=&quot;3240&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/coll-with-net-2012_08_16_OR_P1190177_Josef_Settele.jpg&quot; width=&quot;4320&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Field researcher with butterfly net&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Josef Settele&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are aware that the ecological community has specific needs that may entail changes to the ‘default’ Registered Reports format. As standard, we will stipulate a timeframe of one year between the end of stage 1 review/in principle acceptance and submission of the completed study and the beginning of stage 2 review. However, we are aware that for some studies (such as those involving multiple field seasons) this will not be feasible; we will be happy to discuss extending this period when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we know that the nature of ecological research means that even the best research protocols may need to change when faced with the reality of field-work; problems will be encountered that to solve will require modifications to the proposed protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, we will be happy for authors to modify their protocols, and present exploratory analyses that may be suggested by interim results (along with serendipitous findings), as long as these are clearly marked as such in the final paper (and of course if our reviewers agree the changes and additions are justified). Note also that the Introduction cannot be changed after data collection, ensuring that the initial rationale of the study is clearly presented to readers no matter the changes that occurred during the actual course of the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the idea of Registered Reports will not appeal to everyone, and we intend it to complement rather than supplant the ‘traditional’ peer review process. We see the inclusion of Registered Reports in &lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/em&gt; very much as an experiment in itself; we are excited about working with the ecology community to determine if this format can improve peer review to better meet their needs. We believe that this initiative will help improve the credibility and transparency of the review process and we hope that our enthusiasm is shared by the authors, reviewers, and readers of &lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to enquire about any aspect of the Registered Reports review process, or have any feedback, please do get in touch with us: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:bmcecol@biomedcentral.com&quot;&gt;bmcecol@biomedcentral.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conscientiousness is a fundamental aspect of human personality, with higher levels associated with all kinds of benefits, from greater academic achievement and relationship stability to living for longer.  Yet it’s the only major human personality dimension not to have been widely identified in animals, which poses an evolutionary puzzle – if animals don’t show signs of conscientiousness, where did the human variety come from? But now a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-18573-001&quot;&gt;major review&lt;/a&gt; of hundreds of relevant papers, published in &lt;i&gt;Psychological Bulletin&lt;/i&gt;, concludes that in fact, “there are many documented examples of conscientiousness behaviour in other animals”. The work also suggests that there are two main branches to conscientiousness, each associated with an evolutionary drive to solve different types of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-29296&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this new research, the only clear evidence for animal conscientiousness was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004722&quot;&gt;a study of chimpanzees&lt;/a&gt; and a report of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16594834&quot;&gt;aspects of conscientiousness in a group of captive orangutans&lt;/a&gt;. Based on this limited data, some researchers suggested that conscientiousness evolved after the last common ancestor of chimps and humans diverged from other ape species, 7 to 10 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their new review, Mikel Delgado and Frank Sulloway at the University of California, Berkeley, looked for indirect evidence of animal conscientiousness, searching nearly 3,000 potentially relevant papers for any of 103 trait terms related to conscientiousness in descriptions of animal behaviour consistent with how it’s characterised in people (there are six facets to human conscientiousness including orderliness, dutifulness, competence and achievement striving).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified 876 papers that provided “strong” or “possible” evidence of animal conscientiousness. For example, in searching on the trait term “achievement”, they identified research showing that cows’ heart rates are higher when they’re learning. In searching on “lazy”, they found reports of trainers’ descriptions of some horses, and also work on variations in the willingness of bees to protect a hive. And in a search on “appearance” (which falls under the facet of “order”), they found a study that rated hyenas as appearing “attractive”, “clean” or “scruffy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this, the researchers identified two categories of conscientious behaviour in animals: the first includes the traits of achievement striving and competence; the second includes order, industriousness and responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delgado and Sulloway found that primates and other mammals are much more similar to each other than they are to other animal groups, particularly in scoring positively on the first conscientiousness category. In contrast, birds, insects and fish stood out for having positive scores on the second. Amphibians/reptiles and other invertebrates had neutral or low scores on both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Notwithstanding some inconsistencies, the results…closely parallel the known phylogenetic relationship of the taxa involved,” they note. The noticeable exception was the placement of insects, which might have been expected to lie closer to other invertebrates than to birds and fish; the reason for this anomaly could be the relatively high number of studies of social insects, which have evolved caste systems and worker instincts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two categories of conscientious traits may have evolved separately to solve at least two different sets of problems, the researchers added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order/industriousness/responsibility category seems to relate to the building of nests or other protective structures, and colony life, and there are hints that at least some of these traits bring clear benefits – blackbirds with neat and tidy nests are better at rejecting foreign eggs, for example, and bees that remove more dead bodies from their hives gain more weight and rear more young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other category, focused on achievement striving and competence, relates more to intelligent behaviour generally and is important for an animal’s ability to cope with the demands of living in a group. So it’s possible that an increasingly complex social environment drove the development of this set of traits, Delgado and Sulloway write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We should be somewhat cautious in accepting these results as an actual phylogenetic model for the evolution of conscientiousness,” they add. “Nevertheless, the remarkably close parallel between the known phylogenetic record…and the results of our own study…suggest that the relationship is not coincidental and that the evolution of conscientiousness has closely tracked the increasing complexity of biological evolution more generally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all conscientiousness-related traits that have been identified in people could be picked up in animals. Thanks to our advanced ability to work out what others are thinking, and to use language, we seem to be unique in feeling and demonstrating “dutifulness”, “conventionality”, “traditionalism” and “virtue”. In fact, because research on conscientiousness in people has so often focused on emotions, intentions and morality, rather than behaviours, this may explain why it hasn’t been picked up in a variety of animals before, Delgado and Sulloway suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important limitation of the new review, acknowledged by the authors, is that human biases may affect the labels that researchers give to animal behaviours. Are some insects really “orderly”, for example, rather than “competent” or “self-controlled”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the pair felt able to conclude, “We have found ample evidence that building blocks for the personality dimension of conscientiousness exist across species, from insects to primates, even if this domain of behaviour sometimes expresses itself differently in other animals than it does in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/P4130140-2-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans have altered natural environments in profound and permanent ways. Indeed, various forms of human disturbance, including habitat destruction, an influx of trash, noise pollution, or introduced species, represent the primary threat to many species worldwide. Understanding how animals respond to these environmental changes is key for predicting the future survival of key species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study we studied the effects of urbanization on native finches in the Galapagos Islands. The Galapagos have a well-known place in the heart and history of biology; Charles Darwin’s visit there in 1835 helped inspire his theory of evolution. The islands also present a great opportunity to study urbanization because unlike most Pacific archipelagos, the Galapagos were uninhabited until relatively recently. However, tourism and development on the islands has increased dramatically in the past 50 years, which creates new challenges for the native species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9444&quot; style=&quot;width: 435px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sabrina McNew &quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9444 &quot; height=&quot;283&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/DSC_0239-2-1024x683.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Sabrina McNew &quot; width=&quot;425&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Boats moored near the fisherman’s dock in Puerto Ayora (Sabrina McNew, CC)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to investigate if finches near Puerto Ayora, the urban center of Santa Cruz Island, were different than finches living in a more undisturbed habitat about 10km away. We studied two species at each site: the medium ground finch (&lt;em&gt;Geospiza fortis&lt;/em&gt;) and the small ground finch (&lt;em&gt;Geospiza fuliginosa&lt;/em&gt;), both of which are part of the group of 18 or so species collectively known as “Darwin’s finches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is “epigenetics?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally in evolutionary biology it’s assumed that for populations to change in response to the environment, selection must act on standing genetic variation. That is, certain genotypes are better suited to the new environment and so they will survive longer and have more offspring. However, the accumulation and spread of mutations that confer an advantage can be a slow and random process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new and exciting mechanism of adaptation to new environments involves “epigenetics.” These processes refer to molecular changes that affect when and how genes are expressed and can alter the phenotype of the organism independent of its DNA sequence. In this study we focused on DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification that can affect gene expression and, in some cases, is passed on to offspring. Importantly, other studies have found that DNA methylation can be affected by the environment, which means it’s a potential process by which animals can rapidly respond to changing environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could epigenetics be playing a part in the response of Darwin’s finches to urbanization? To find out we tested for DNA methylation variation, as well as morphological and genetic variation, between urban and rural populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we find? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9445&quot; style=&quot;width: 374px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9445 &quot; height=&quot;273&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/beach-1024x768.jpg&quot; width=&quot;364&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;The landscape of El Garrapatero, our “rural” site (Sabrina McNew, CC)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one of our two species, the medium ground finch, we saw that urban finches were bigger in nearly all measurements than rural finches, potentially due to an increase in food resources near Puerto Ayora. Small ground finches, however, showed no differences in size between the urban and rural sites. We’re not sure why we only found morphological differences in the medium ground finch; however, it could be due to the fact that medium ground finches are generally more variable in size and so selection would likely act faster on this species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not find any genetic differences between urban and rural populations. These results are consistent with previous studies that find little genetic variation in Darwin’s finch populations and species. Interestingly, however, we found striking epigenetic differences between urban and rural populations for both species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does this matter? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biological studies are just beginning to study epigenetics in wild populations. Although we can’t be certain how the DNA methylation changes we observed affect the way the birds look or act, it’s exciting to find that there is epigenetic variation between two geographically close populations. This is a first step in understanding if epigenetics is key to adaptation to rapidly changing environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting the scene for their research, Katherine Elliston at the University of Tasmania and her colleagues said that in Australia, around 30 to 41 per cent of people’s daily energy intake comes from snacking rather than from proper meals. This makes the psychology of snacking an important part of helping people to avoid over-eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 61 participants (42 women) through social media and flyers and asked them to complete a range of baseline psychological measures, including how much they think about the costs and benefits of healthy eating as occurring sooner rather than later (this comes from “Temporal Self-regulation Theory” – people are less likely to eat healthily when they see the benefits as distant and the costs as imminent); they also rated their intentions to eat more healthily; reported how often they’d eaten five fruit and veg per day recently; and rated their powers of self-regulation and willpower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, for the next two weeks, the participants used an app to record any times that they ate food, and whether it was a snack (high or low energy) or a main meal. Sometimes they were also prompted at this point to record any situational cues relevant to snacking, such as: whether snacks were currently available; whether they were in a bad mood; whether they could see anyone else snacking; whether they were near a fast food shop. The app also beeped at random times through the day and asked the participants to record the presence of any of these same situational cues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the participants recorded eating a total of 1127 snacks across the two-week study period. They reported the presence of other people snacking more often when they had just logged their own snacking than during times they weren’t snacking (i.e. when they were prompted randomly by the app), indicating a possible causal role for this situational cue, though the current design can’t prove this. The same pattern was also true for being in a bad mood and having snacks available and easily accessible – these were present more often during snacking than during random prompts when not eating, suggesting these cues may have contributed to snacking. Proximity to food outlets didn’t appear to be a relevant factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intentions and past healthy eating behaviour were not associated with the odds of snacking. Seeing the costs of healthy eating as coming early, before eating, was associated with more snacking. Lower self regulation was also associated with more high energy snacking overall, but these baseline measures were less strongly associated with snacking than momentary cues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said their study represented a successful application of Temporal Self-regulation Theory to explain snacking. “The results demonstrate that snacking is largely guided by momentary cues and that motivational-level factors may be less important in guiding snacking than previously thought,” they said, adding that helping people combat stress and low mood, and reducing the availability of snacks, could help people eat fewer unhealthy snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings add to previous research that has shown that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/18/is-willpower-overrated/&quot;&gt;goal attainment&lt;/a&gt; and healthy behaviour is more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/01/03/already-struggling-to-keep-new-year-resolutions-heres-the-first-detailed-study-of-daily-temptation-and-resistance/&quot;&gt;avoiding temptation&lt;/a&gt; in the first place than exercising iron willpower. Avoid going to the cafe that sells those amazing muffins, especially when you’re in a bad mood, and you’ll probably find you snack on them less. This sounds simple enough, but unfortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2009/12/10/step-away-from-the-cookie-jar-over-confidence-in-self-control-leads-us-to-temptation/&quot;&gt;we have a tendency to overestimate our willpower&lt;/a&gt; – especially when we’re not hungry, we forget how tempting snacks can be when we are!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 Nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia (NH3) via nitrite (NO2−) to nitrate (NO3−), is a key process of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle. For decades, ammonia and nitrite oxidation were thought to be separately catalysed by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA), and by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). The recent discovery of complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox) in the NOB genus Nitrospira, which alone convert ammonia to nitrate, raised questions about the ecological niches in which comammox Nitrospira successfully compete with canonical nitrifiers. Here we isolate a pure culture of a comammox bacterium, Nitrospira inopinata, and show that it is adapted to slow growth in oligotrophic and dynamic habitats on the basis of a high affinity for ammonia, low maximum rate of ammonia oxidation, high growth yield compared to canonical nitrifiers, and genomic potential for alternative metabolisms. The nitrification kinetics of four AOA from soil and hot springs were determined for comparison. Their surprisingly poor substrate affinities and lower growth yields reveal that, in contrast to earlier assumptions, AOA are not necessarily the most competitive ammonia oxidizers present in strongly oligotrophic environments and that N. inopinata has the highest substrate affinity of all analysed ammonia oxidizer isolates except the marine AOA Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1 (ref. 3). These results suggest a role for comammox organisms in nitrification under oligotrophic and dynamic conditions.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Epithelial organs undergo steady-state turnover throughout adult life, with old cells being continually replaced by the progeny of stem cell divisions. To avoid hyperplasia or atrophy, organ turnover demands strict equilibration of cell production and loss. However, the mechanistic basis of this equilibrium is unknown. Here we show that robustly precise turnover of the adult Drosophila intestine arises through a coupling mechanism in which enterocyte apoptosis breaks feedback inhibition of stem cell division. Healthy enterocytes inhibit stem cell division through E-cadherin, which prevents secretion of mitogenic epidermal growth factors (EGFs) by repressing transcription of the EGF maturation factor rhomboid. Individual apoptotic enterocytes promote divisions by loss of E-cadherin, which releases cadherin-associated β-catenin (Armadillo in Drosophila) and p120-catenin to induce rhomboid. Induction of rhomboid in the dying enterocyte triggers activation of the EGF receptor (Egfr) in stem cells within a discrete radius. When we blocked apoptosis, E-cadherin-controlled feedback suppressed divisions, and the organ retained the same number of cells. When we disrupted feedback, apoptosis and divisions were uncoupled, and the organ developed either hyperplasia or atrophy. Together, our results show that robust cellular balance hinges on the obligate coupling of divisions to apoptosis, which limits the proliferative potential of a stem cell to the precise time and place at which a replacement cell is needed. In this way, localized cell–cell communication gives rise to tissue-level homeostatic equilibrium and constant organ size.

		<link href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/5X5tA0lok3o/nature23670"/>
		<id>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature23670</id>

 &lt;p&gt;
 In two previously described donors, the extracellular domain of LAIR1, a collagen-binding inhibitory receptor encoded on chromosome 19 (ref. 1), was inserted between the V and DJ segments of an antibody. This insertion generated, through somatic mutations, broadly reactive antibodies against RIFINs, a type of variant antigen expressed on the surface of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes. To investigate how frequently such antibodies are produced in response to malaria infection, we screened plasma from two large cohorts of individuals living in malaria-endemic regions. Here we report that 5–10% of malaria-exposed individuals, but none of the European blood donors tested, have high levels of LAIR1-containing antibodies that dominate the response to infected erythrocytes without conferring enhanced protection against febrile malaria. By analysing the antibody-producing B cell clones at the protein, cDNA and gDNA levels, we characterized additional LAIR1 insertions between the V and DJ segments and discovered a second insertion modality whereby the LAIR1 exon encoding the extracellular domain and flanking intronic sequences are inserted into the switch region. By exon shuffling, this mechanism leads to the production of bispecific antibodies in which the LAIR1 domain is precisely positioned at the elbow between the VH and CH1 domains. Additionally, in one donor the genomic DNA encoding the VH and CH1 domains was deleted, leading to the production of a camel-like LAIR1-containing antibody. Sequencing of the switch regions of memory B cells from European blood donors revealed frequent templated inserts originating from transcribed genes that, in rare cases, comprised exons with orientations and frames compatible with expression. These results reveal different modalities of LAIR1 insertion that lead to public and dominant antibodies against infected erythrocytes and suggest that insertion of templated DNA represents an additional mechanism of antibody diversification that can be selected in the immune response against pathogens and exploited for B cell engineering.

 Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) have a pivotal role in the establishment and maintenance of immunological self-tolerance and homeostasis. Transcriptional programming of regulatory mechanisms facilitates the functional activation of Treg cells in the prevention of diverse types of inflammatory responses. It remains unclear how Treg cells orchestrate their homeostasis and interplay with environmental signals. Here we show that liver kinase B1 (LKB1) programs the metabolic and functional fitness of Treg cells in the control of immune tolerance and homeostasis. Mice with a Treg-specific deletion of LKB1 developed a fatal inflammatory disease characterized by excessive TH2-type-dominant responses. LKB1 deficiency disrupted Treg cell survival and mitochondrial fitness and metabolism, but also induced aberrant expression of immune regulatory molecules including the negative co-receptor PD-1 and the TNF receptor superfamily proteins GITR and OX40. Unexpectedly, LKB1 function in Treg cells was independent of conventional AMPK signalling or the mTORC1–HIF-1α axis, but contributed to the activation of β-catenin signalling for the control of PD-1 and TNF receptor proteins. Blockade of PD-1 activity reinvigorated the ability of LKB1-deficient Treg cells to suppress TH2 responses and the interplay with dendritic cells primed by thymic stromal lymphopoietin. Thus, Treg cells use LKB1 signalling to coordinate their metabolic and immunological homeostasis and to prevent apoptotic and functional exhaustion, thereby orchestrating the balance between immunity and tolerance.
