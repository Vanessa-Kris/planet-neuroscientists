 &lt;img alt=&quot;Pixabay&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/truke-img-2-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As scientific research becomes more reliant on published datasets and online resources, the effects of data corruption are a growing concern. This is particularly the case in the field of genomics where researchers often use online depositories and published supplements for their analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems can occur when data is altered by formatting defaults in programs such as Microsoft Excel. This poses a problem to genomics researchers when gene names are converted to dates. For example, inputted gene names such as ‘SEPT2’ may be converted to 2016/09/02 when the program automatically formats this gene name to a date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The huge scale of this problem was highlighted by &lt;em&gt;Ziemann et al&lt;/em&gt; in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1044-7&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0066cc;&quot;&gt;article published&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recently in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;Genome Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The researchers scanned leading genomics journals to find that one fifth of papers containing supplementary gene lists harboured these errors. Altered gene names were present in 987 supplementary files of 704 publications. Interestingly, it transpired that the journals with the highest impact factors were more likely to contain the corrupted data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8832&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pixabay&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8832&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/truke-img-1-300x169.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding this high rate of data corruption in published materials is disconcerting to the genomics community, who utilise these data sources heavily. This error can be difficult to reverse, and there have been few known solutions to remediate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to combat this troubling issue a team from Health Research Institute Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP) in Spain have developed a new software tool named &lt;em&gt;Truke&lt;/em&gt;, to help retain the integrity of genomic data. The new software which is described in an article &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3631-8&quot;&gt;recently published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Genomics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, restores corrupted symbols to their original gene names, through methods such as library referencing and reverse engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sourcing data from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Center for Biotechnology Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (NCBI) database, a library of error prone gene symbols are collated, and their corresponding ‘dates’ predicted. When the user’s datasets are scanned by the system, the false dates are identified, and converted back to their original gene names. Safeguards are in place to avoid errors in the system. For example, in cases where a false date could correspond to more than one gene name, such as SEPT1 or SEPT-1, this discrepancy is flagged to the user for action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Truke&lt;/em&gt; web application was built using R, Shiny, HTML and bootstrap2 programming tools, and is freely available for use at &lt;a href=&quot;http://maplab.cat/truke&quot;&gt;http://maplab.cat/truke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3631-8?utm_content=buffer6d452&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_campaign=buffer&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, we are presented with a potential solution to a problem which can be commonly overlooked by both scientists and publishers. While more and more data is published each year, perhaps these threats to data integrity can be lessened with the help of software solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it be nice to work in an environment focused on cooperation and solidarity, one that put the needs of the many above those of the few? Sounds great … but collectivism has some surprising downsides, especially if you’re a star performer. New &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-06323-001/&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Applied Psychology&lt;/i&gt; looks at workplace reactions to high performers and their polarising effect on those around them, and shows that in more cooperative climates, hotshots are actually more likely to get a raw deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-22509&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Campbell and her colleagues surveyed 350 hair stylists, mainly women, working within a chain of Taiwanese salons. The researchers were interested in how the most successful stylists were treated by their peers: they identified hotshots by asking managers for performance ratings, and then they surveyed all the staff to find out the benefits and threats they saw in each other, and how much criticism and support they received. They also asked stylists about their salon’s working climate by asking them how much they agreed with statements like “there is a high level of cooperation between stylists”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can consider a fellow hotshot a benefit: an inspiration, a source of advice and expertise, and a way to attract prestige. Or you can see them as a threat; they’re likely to take the best duties and customers, and garner the greatest favour from leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that hotshots experienced more negative treatment in the form of belittling and criticism when they were surrounded by co-workers who felt threatened. In contrast, hotshots received more help and support if their colleagues saw them as a benefit. The typical high performer had a mixed bag: compared to the typical stylist, they were criticised more, but also received more support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that support was lacking within salons with more cooperative climates. This might seem puzzling until you understand a cooperative climate isn’t about sweetness and biscuits, but rather a culture where group solidarity is paramount. Under these conditions, a stand-out performer is simply a nail that needs to be hammered down, like the 1940s factories whose unionised workers gave a hard time to “rate-busters” whose performance made the rest look bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this systematically, the researchers ran an experiment with 284 US undergraduates, divided into collaborative teams who were told in an introduction either to approach their problem-solving tasks with a highly cooperative focus (e.g. interaction was described as a “collaborative discussion”, and rewards were split equally) or a with a more competitive focus (interaction would be “spirited debate”, and there were more individualised rewards, but still collaborating toward a common goal). Participants were then isolated in separate cubicles and after each round of problem-solving, they received information about the performance of each team-member and had the chance to exchange messages with each other (actually the information and messages were made up by the researchers, but the participants didn’t know this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few rounds, participants were asked how they felt about some of the other specific team members, including those made to seem like hotshots. Participants who perceived a star performer as a threat tended to join in with backbiting when receiving bitchy chat-messages about the hotshot from another member, but crucially this only happened in the cooperative condition. In the low-cooperative one, there was no heightened denigration of hotshots. So whereas the earlier survey evidence suggested that helping of strong performers was impaired by a more cooperative culture, this experiment showed a cooperative culture was associated with more belittling of strong performers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s notoriously hard for organisations to hang on to high performers who are often courted by rival organisations with better financial packages or positions. But money can’t buy working with people who really know, value and respect you. So overly solidarity-focused organisations – the kind that may resent their outstanding performers – risk eroding their edge in holding onto their talent. Maybe that’s just fine for some of the rank and file, but not for those who want their organisations to excel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-06323-001/&quot;&gt;Hot Shots and Cool Reception? An Expanded View of Social Consequences for High Performers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We’re pleased to share an update on the project’s progress. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/new-zealand-genomics-limited&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NZGL&lt;/a&gt; has completed sequencing the second 40 individual kākāpō!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is now past the halfway point with approximately 70 individuals remaining before we’ve successfully sequenced every individual in the entire species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sponsors of individual kākāpō genomes will shortly be receiving their custom DNA artwork. Each DNA portrait is constructed from the genetic data of the individual kākāpō and is guaranteed to be unique. Genome sponsorship forms a key component of ongoing fundraising for the project as we strive to sequence every genome in an entire species.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/sKzumA7mtXo/nature22058"/>
		<id>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22058</id>
		<updated>2017-04-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;
 Vaccine-induced high-avidity IgA can protect against bacterial enteropathogens by directly neutralizing virulence factors or by poorly defined mechanisms that physically impede bacterial interactions with the gut tissues (‘immune exclusion’). IgA-mediated cross-linking clumps bacteria in the gut lumen and is critical for protection against infection by non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium). However, classical agglutination, which was thought to drive this process, is efficient only at high pathogen densities (≥108 non-motile bacteria per gram). In typical infections, much lower densities (100–107 colony-forming units per gram) of rapidly dividing bacteria are present in the gut lumen. Here we show that a different physical process drives formation of clumps in vivo: IgA-mediated cross-linking enchains daughter cells, preventing their separation after division, and clumping is therefore dependent on growth. Enchained growth is effective at all realistic pathogen densities, and accelerates pathogen clearance from the gut lumen. Furthermore, IgA enchains plasmid-donor and -recipient clones into separate clumps, impeding conjugative plasmid transfer in vivo. Enchained growth is therefore a mechanism by which IgA can disarm and clear potentially invasive species from the intestinal lumen without requiring high pathogen densities, inflammation or bacterial killing. Furthermore, our results reveal an untapped potential for oral vaccines in combating the spread of antimicrobial resistance.

 &lt;p&gt;
 The Rad51 (also known as RecA) family of recombinases executes the critical step in homologous recombination: the search for homologous DNA to serve as a template during the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Although budding yeast Rad51 has been extensively characterized in vitro, the stringency of its search and sensitivity to mismatched sequences in vivo remain poorly defined. Here, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we analysed Rad51-dependent break-induced replication in which the invading DSB end and its donor template share a 108-base-pair homology region and the donor carries different densities of single-base-pair mismatches. With every eighth base pair mismatched, repair was about 14% of that of completely homologous sequences. With every sixth base pair mismatched, repair was still more than 5%. Thus, completing break-induced replication in vivo overcomes the apparent requirement for at least 6–8 consecutive paired bases that has been inferred from in vitro studies. When recombination occurs without a protruding nonhomologous 3′ tail, the mismatch repair protein Msh2 does not discourage homeologous recombination. However, when the DSB end contains a 3′ protruding nonhomologous tail, Msh2 promotes the rejection of mismatched substrates. Mismatch correction of strand invasion heteroduplex DNA is strongly polar, favouring correction close to the DSB end. Nearly all mismatch correction depends on the proofreading activity of DNA polymerase-δ, although the repair proteins Msh2, Mlh1 and Exo1 influence the extent of correction.

 There are no disease-modifying treatments for adult human neurodegenerative diseases. Here we test RNA-targeted therapies in two mouse models of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), an autosomal dominant polyglutamine disease. Both models recreate the progressive adult-onset dysfunction and degeneration of a neuronal network that are seen in patients, including decreased firing frequency of cerebellar Purkinje cells and a decline in motor function. We developed a potential therapy directed at the ATXN2 gene by screening 152 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). The most promising oligonucleotide, ASO7, downregulated ATXN2 mRNA and protein, which resulted in delayed onset of the SCA2 phenotype. After delivery by intracerebroventricular injection to ATXN2-Q127 mice, ASO7 localized to Purkinje cells, reduced cerebellar ATXN2 expression below 75% for more than 10 weeks without microglial activation, and reduced the levels of cerebellar ATXN2. Treatment of symptomatic mice with ASO7 improved motor function compared to saline-treated mice. ASO7 had a similar effect in the BAC-Q72 SCA2 mouse model, and in both mouse models it normalized protein levels of several SCA2-related proteins expressed in Purkinje cells, including Rgs8, Pcp2, Pcp4, Homer3, Cep76 and Fam107b. Notably, the firing frequency of Purkinje cells returned to normal even when treatment was initiated more than 12 weeks after the onset of the motor phenotype in BAC-Q72 mice. These findings support ASOs as a promising approach for treating some human neurodegenerative diseases.

 The 2013–2016 West African epidemic caused by the Ebola virus was of unprecedented magnitude, duration and impact. Here we reconstruct the dispersal, proliferation and decline of Ebola virus throughout the region by analysing 1,610 Ebola virus genomes, which represent over 5% of the known cases. We test the association of geography, climate and demography with viral movement among administrative regions, inferring a classic ‘gravity’ model, with intense dispersal between larger and closer populations. Despite attenuation of international dispersal after border closures, cross-border transmission had already sown the seeds for an international epidemic, rendering these measures ineffective at curbing the epidemic. We address why the epidemic did not spread into neighbouring countries, showing that these countries were susceptible to substantial outbreaks but at lower risk of introductions. Finally, we reveal that this large epidemic was a heterogeneous and spatially dissociated collection of transmission clusters of varying size, duration and connectivity. These insights will help to inform interventions in future epidemics.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by motor neuron loss and that leads to paralysis and death 2–5 years after disease onset. Nearly all patients with ALS have aggregates of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 in their brains and spinal cords, and rare mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 can cause ALS. There are no effective TDP-43-directed therapies for ALS or related TDP-43 proteinopathies, such as frontotemporal dementia. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and RNA-interference approaches are emerging as attractive therapeutic strategies in neurological diseases. Indeed, treatment of a rat model of inherited ALS (caused by a mutation in Sod1) with ASOs against Sod1 has been shown to substantially slow disease progression. However, as SOD1 mutations account for only around 2–5% of ALS cases, additional therapeutic strategies are needed. Silencing TDP-43 itself is probably not appropriate, given its critical cellular functions. Here we present a promising alternative therapeutic strategy for ALS that involves targeting ataxin-2. A decrease in ataxin-2 suppresses TDP-43 toxicity in yeast and flies, and intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions in the ataxin-2 gene increase risk of ALS. We used two independent approaches to test whether decreasing ataxin-2 levels could mitigate disease in a mouse model of TDP-43 proteinopathy. First, we crossed ataxin-2 knockout mice with TDP-43 (also known as TARDBP) transgenic mice. The decrease in ataxin-2 reduced aggregation of TDP-43, markedly increased survival and improved motor function. Second, in a more therapeutically applicable approach, we administered ASOs targeting ataxin-2 to the central nervous system of TDP-43 transgenic mice. This single treatment markedly extended survival. Because TDP-43 aggregation is a component of nearly all cases of ALS, targeting ataxin-2 could represent a broadly effective therapeutic strategy.

 &lt;p&gt;The relationship between dinosaurs and other reptiles is well established, but the sequence of acquisition of dinosaurian features has been obscured by the scarcity of fossils with transitional morphologies. The closest extinct relatives of dinosaurs either have highly derived morphologies or are known from poorly preserved or incomplete material. Here we describe one of the stratigraphically lowest and phylogenetically earliest members of the avian stem lineage (Avemetatarsalia), Teleocrater rhadinus gen. et sp. nov., from the Middle Triassic epoch. The anatomy of T. rhadinus provides key information that unites several enigmatic taxa from across Pangaea into a previously unrecognized clade, Aphanosauria. This clade is the sister taxon of Ornithodira (pterosaurs and birds) and shortens the ghost lineage inferred at the base of Avemetatarsalia. We demonstrate that several anatomical features long thought to characterize Dinosauria and dinosauriforms evolved much earlier, soon after the bird–crocodylian split, and that the earliest avemetatarsalians retained the crocodylian-like ankle morphology and hindlimb proportions of stem archosaurs and early pseudosuchians. Early avemetatarsalians were substantially more species-rich, widely geographically distributed and morphologically diverse than previously recognized. Moreover, several early dinosauromorphs that were previously used as models to understand dinosaur origins may represent specialized forms rather than the ancestral avemetatarsalian morphology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22037&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature22037&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/wNGe1vrWbc0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 A major goal of biomedicine is to understand the function of every gene in the human genome. Loss-of-function mutations can disrupt both copies of a given gene in humans and phenotypic analysis of such ‘human knockouts’ can provide insight into gene function. Consanguineous unions are more likely to result in offspring carrying homozygous loss-of-function mutations. In Pakistan, consanguinity rates are notably high. Here we sequence the protein-coding regions of 10,503 adult participants in the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction Study (PROMIS), designed to understand the determinants of cardiometabolic diseases in individuals from South Asia. We identified individuals carrying homozygous predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) mutations, and performed phenotypic analysis involving more than 200 biochemical and disease traits. We enumerated 49,138 rare (&amp;lt;1% minor allele frequency) pLoF mutations. These pLoF mutations are estimated to knock out 1,317 genes, each in at least one participant. Homozygosity for pLoF mutations at PLA2G7 was associated with absent enzymatic activity of soluble lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2; at CYP2F1, with higher plasma interleukin-8 concentrations; at TREH, with lower concentrations of apoB-containing lipoprotein subfractions; at either A3GALT2 or NRG4, with markedly reduced plasma insulin C-peptide concentrations; and at SLC9A3R1, with mediators of calcium and phosphate signalling. Heterozygous deficiency of APOC3 has been shown to protect against coronary heart disease; we identified APOC3 homozygous pLoF carriers in our cohort. We recruited these human knockouts and challenged them with an oral fat load. Compared with family members lacking the mutation, individuals with APOC3 knocked out displayed marked blunting of the usual post-prandial rise in plasma triglycerides. Overall, these observations provide a roadmap for a ‘human knockout project’, a systematic effort to understand the phenotypic consequences of complete disruption of genes in humans.

 In vertebrates, skin colour patterns emerge from nonlinear dynamical microscopic systems of cell interactions. Here we show that in ocellated lizards a quasi-hexagonal lattice of skin scales, rather than individual chromatophore cells, establishes a green and black labyrinthine pattern of skin colour. We analysed time series of lizard scale colour dynamics over four years of their development and demonstrate that this pattern is produced by a cellular automaton (a grid of elements whose states are iterated according to a set of rules based on the states of neighbouring elements) that dynamically computes the colour states of individual mesoscopic skin scales to produce the corresponding macroscopic colour pattern. Using numerical simulations and mathematical derivation, we identify how a discrete von Neumann cellular automaton emerges from a continuous Turing reaction–diffusion system. Skin thickness variation generated by three-dimensional morphogenesis of skin scales causes the underlying reaction–diffusion dynamics to separate into microscopic and mesoscopic spatial scales, the latter generating a cellular automaton. Our study indicates that cellular automata are not merely abstract computational systems, but can directly correspond to processes generated by biological evolution.

 &lt;p&gt;Epithelial tissues (epithelia) remove excess cells through extrusion, preventing the accumulation of unnecessary or pathological cells. The extrusion process can be triggered by apoptotic signalling, oncogenic transformation and overcrowding of cells. Despite the important linkage of cell extrusion to developmental, homeostatic and pathological processes such as cancer metastasis, its underlying mechanism and connections to the intrinsic mechanics of the epithelium are largely unexplored. We approach this problem by modelling the epithelium as an active nematic liquid crystal (that has a long range directional order), and comparing numerical simulations to strain rate and stress measurements within monolayers of MDCK (Madin Darby canine kidney) cells. Here we show that apoptotic cell extrusion is provoked by singularities in cell alignments in the form of comet-shaped topological defects. We find a universal correlation between extrusion sites and positions of nematic defects in the cell orientation field in different epithelium types. The results confirm the active nematic nature of epithelia, and demonstrate that defect-induced isotropic stresses are the primary precursors of mechanotransductive responses in cells, including YAP (Yes-associated protein) transcription factor activity, caspase-3-mediated cell death, and extrusions. Importantly, the defect-driven extrusion mechanism depends on intercellular junctions, because the weakening of cell–cell interactions in an α-catenin knockdown monolayer reduces the defect size and increases both the number of defects and extrusion rates, as is also predicted by our model. We further demonstrate the ability to control extrusion hotspots by geometrically inducing defects through microcontact printing of patterned monolayers. On the basis of these results, we propose a mechanism for apoptotic cell extrusion: spontaneously formed topological defects in epithelia govern cell fate. This will be important in predicting extrusion hotspots and dynamics in vivo, with potential applications to tissue regeneration and the suppression of metastasis. Moreover, we anticipate that the analogy between the epithelium and active nematic liquid crystals will trigger further investigations of the link between cellular processes and the material properties of epithelia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature 544 212 &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21718&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature21718&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/FMCLBNGKrVo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

&lt;em&gt;For put them side by side—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The one the other will contain”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;            —Emily Dickinson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During human evolution, our cerebral cortex increased in size in response to new environmental challenges. The cerebral cortex is the site of diverse processes, including visual perception and language acquisition. However, no accepted unitary theory of cortical function exists yet. One hypothesis is that there is an evolutionarily conserved neural circuit that implements a simple and flexible computation. This idea is known as the “canonical circuit.”  As Gary Marcus, Adam Marblestone, and Thomas Dean note in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/346/6209/551.full.pdf&quot;&gt;perspective piece in Science&lt;/a&gt;, there is still no consensus about whether such a canonical circuit exists nearly four decades later. Researchers argue that there is little evidence that such a uniform structure can capture the diversity of cortical function in simple mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would it mean for the cortex to be diverse rather than uniform? Marcus and his colleagues propose that the brain may consist of an array of elementary computational units, which act in parallel as a microprocessor&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. To probe at questions on cortical circuitry, collaborative endeavors engaging scientists and engineers have emerged. In parallel with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humanbrainproject.eu&quot;&gt;Human Brain Project&lt;/a&gt; in Europe, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov&quot;&gt;Brain Research through Advancing Imaging Neurotechnologies&lt;/a&gt; Initiative is developing tools to view the brain at superior spatial and temporal resolution&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Researchers aim to directly study the relationship of a neuron’s function to its connections. This can be accomplished by mapping neuronal connections in conjunction with acquiring functional activity data.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers can scale up from the study of neurons and synapses to those of neural circuits and networks. However, this bottom-up approach may not be the best way to understand the neural basis of human cognition. Psychologist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aai/2010/918062/#B14&quot;&gt;Frank van der Welde&lt;/a&gt; argues that this confuses the nature of understanding with the way to achieve understanding&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. He provides an analogy to physics. To understand the universe, a bottom-up approach would begin with an understanding of elementary particles, how these particles combine to make atoms, and how atoms to combine to make molecules. However, physics did not begin with the study of elementary particles. It began with a study of the solar system, which provided the first law of motion. In summary, understanding can proceed from top to bottom as well as bottom to top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand human cognition, neuroscientists should combine top-down and bottom-up approaches. One top-down approach is generating a large-scale simulation of neural processes that generate intelligence. This project intersects neuroscience and artificial intelligence. For instance, a research team at IBM represented 8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and 6400 synapses per neuron on the IBM Blue Gene Processor, and ran 1 s of model time in 10 s of real time&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. Large-scale simulations provide a tool to investigate the brain not limited by the experimental and ethical limitations of &lt;em&gt;in vivo &lt;/em&gt;work. Through such virtual models alongside neuroscience studies, researchers may arrive at the neural basis of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rise of Artificial Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As neuroscience details the anatomy and activity of the brain, artificial intelligence seeks to develop an independent, non-biological path to intelligence. Researchers of both fields can agree that artificial intelligence is not the equal of natural intelligence in most important tasks for human cognition such as vision, motor manipulations, and natural language understanding. However, this is not to say that artificial intelligence won’t ultimately achieve principles of natural intelligence. I met with &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.nyu.edu/davise/&quot;&gt;Ernest Davis&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of computer science at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nyu.edu&quot;&gt;New York University&lt;/a&gt;, to learn more about artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advances in artificial intelligence have been incredible, from IBM Watson to Google DeepMind AlphaGo. Davis believes that AI will continue to advance and be used for positive and negative applications. For instance, AI can be used for improving &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/ai-versus-md&quot;&gt;the quality of medicine&lt;/a&gt; and building &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/selfdrivingcar/&quot;&gt;self-driving cars&lt;/a&gt;. “The impact of that will be largely positive though there will be a negative impact on employment. It will also be used for military purposes, and the immediate effects of that are mostly negative,” Davis says. Nevertheless, artificial intelligence is far from building programs that retain human-level intelligence. The human brain has an unsurpassed ability to do complex, real-time interactions in a dynamic world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement reasoning in artificial intelligence, Davis explains different techniques available by example. For instance, chess-playing program Deep Blue did reasoning by thinking through a large number of paths to the future and determining what solution works out. A second example is software verification programs. These algorithms search for bugs in programs through logical reasoning. The program provides users with a formal proof that a program doesn’t have a certain kind of bug. A third example is taxonomic reasoning, which is a simple form of logical reasoning by category. This type of reasoning has been done in programs called semantic nets, which have been in use for 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Century of the Brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paulallen.com&quot;&gt;Paul Allen&lt;/a&gt;, the co-founder of Microsoft, has funded two distinct research projects in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2015/09/30/brain/?utm_term=.eb1f3ef1b622&quot;&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; aptly describes it as Allen’s $500 million quest to dissect the mind and code a new one from scratch. Elon Musk has funded a rival company called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/27/elon-musk-neuralink-ai-cranial-computing/&quot;&gt;NeuroLink&lt;/a&gt; to create human-computer hybrids. To build an artificial brain, Davis believes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The replica of the human brain can mean either the ability to do human-level tasks, which I think in principle is possible, or algorithms that are an imitation of the brain. We don’t yet know which direction is the best way to pursue AI. There’s an awful lot we don’t understand about the brain so it may be pre-mature to try the latter. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;            Neuroscience and artificial intelligence both aim to identify architectures of intelligence and cognition. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psych.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/gazzaniga&quot;&gt;Michael Gazzaniga&lt;/a&gt; states that cognitive neuroscience asks: what are the algorithms that drive structural neural elements into the physiological activity that results in perception, cognition, and consciousness? Likewise, artificial intelligence asks: what are the algorithms that can generate human-like intelligence in machines to perform reasoning, planning, and learning? Both fields describe mechanisms of intelligence as “algorithms.”&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; To uncover human intelligence and cognition, intersections in neuroscience and artificial intelligence are necessary. Perhaps only then can we can understand what makes us human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us work to live, others live to work – these toilers see hard graft as virtuous and they’re more than happy to go the extra mile to climb the career ladder and serve their employer. Organisations, understandably, are interested in hiring people with this kind of work ethic and so psychologists are trying to find out where it comes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s already known that children with harder working parents also tend to have a stronger work ethic. But a new study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of General Psychology&lt;/em&gt; is one of the first to investigate whether our relationship with our parents in the past – when we were teenagers – is related to our attitude and approach to work as adults. Monique Leenders at the University of Groningen and her colleagues found some small but statistically significant correlations, in particular men’s approach to work seemed to be related to the quality of the teenage relationship they had with their fathers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-22444&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers surveyed nearly 4,000 people in the Netherlands, including 1526 men with an average age of 47 and 2291 women with an average age of 44. The participants answered items tapping the quality of the relationship they had with mother and with their father when they were in their teens, such as rating their agreement with “My mother [father] and I were very close” and “I always felt that my father [mother] supported me”. They also said whether they agreed with statements regarding their approach to work, such as “I’d rather work overtime than fail to get something done on time”, and their work ethic, such as “I feel happiest after I’ve worked hard”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, there was a small but statistically significant correlation between the quality of the participants’ teen relationships with their parents and their current work attitude and work ethic. Digging deeper into the stats separately for men and women, the researchers found that the male and female participants’ teen relationship with their fathers, but not their mothers, was correlated with their current approach to work. Meanwhile, men’s work ethic was correlated with their past relationship quality with their mothers and fathers, but women’s work ethic was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that parents influence work values differently and that the relationship with the father is more central to the development of children’s work values than the relationship with the mother,” Leenders and her team said, adding that this may be because historically it is fathers who more often have jobs outside of the home and may therefore “serve as important role models and have more impact on their children than mothers in the work arena.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said their study was just a “first step” and they acknowledged they haven’t proved any causal influence of parental relations on work attitudes. Nonetheless, they said that careers counsellors might help employees not only by discussing their current issues at work, but also by considering the possible influence of their past family relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major complication in interpreting research of this kind, not mentioned by the researchers, is the role of genetic effects. Although it’s tempting to speculate about parental role modelling, any apparent transmission of work ethic from one generation to the next is in large part likely to be related to the inheritance of genes associated with trait Conscientiousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00221309.2016.1258386&quot;&gt;The Role of the Relationship with Parents with Respect to Work Orientation and Work Ethic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone breaks the speed limit, we tend to explain it away as recklessness, machismo, or impatience. But new research led by Vanessa Bowden at the University of Western Australia, suggests that problems in memory, not temperament, may often be the culprit. According to a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-09892-001/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, traffic stops and other interruptions can disrupt our ability to keep track of recent changes to the speed limit. But the research doesn’t entirely let us off the hook: when waiting at a stop, we can reduce these interfering effects by making sure we keep our attention on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-22419&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research involved around 100 students at the University of Western Australia, mostly younger men, which is the demographic most likely to be involved in speeding-related accidents. Participants sat in a simulated driving cockpit with steering wheel, pedals and windscreen projecting a virtual road along which they had to drive for 15 kilometres without speeding, but also without dropping too far below the limit. In the first study, the limit was mostly a brisk 70km/hr, but it periodically decreased to 40km/hr for short sections of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five seconds after entering half of the 40 zones, participants were confronted with a red traffic signal, after which they were three times more likely to go on to speed in the zone – defined as five km/hr or more over the limit – than they were in the other half of the 40 zones, which had no interruption. In the rarer cases of speeding in the uninterrupted zones, the average top speed was just 47km/hr; a breach, but not a flagrant one. But the interrupted drivers reached an average top speed of 60km/hr, closer to the old limit than the current one. Bowden and her colleagues argue that this suggests that the interrupted drivers were frequently forgetting the new lower limit was in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings are consistent with similar evidence from real traffic data, which has also been interpreted in terms of drivers’ disrupted memory. But an alternative explanation is simply that people find traffic stops frustrating and speed to make up for lost time. With no real-life appointments at stake, the current simulation research makes this seem less plausible. But Bowden’s next experiment went one better, by flipping the zones so the default limit was 40km/hr and the exceptions were 70km/hr. They found that when a new 70 zone was interrupted by a red traffic light, participants tended to progress with an inappropriately &lt;i&gt;slow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;speed, not faster: a quarter of interrupted 70 zones involved under-speeding, with participants driving on average at 50km/hr (in contrast, under-speeding, even merely 5km/hr under the limit, almost never occurred in uninterrupted zones). This is strong evidence that participants aren’t hurrying after a light, but simply misremembering the new limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other distractions can compound the problem. When the researchers gave participants a challenging task to do while waiting at a red light in a new speed zone (judging repeatedly whether the newest letter in series was earlier in the alphabet than the previous one; a real life parallel might be using a red light stop to reprogramme your satnav), they found that this led to more instances of what they called “corrected speeding” where the participant shot off and immediately exceeded the limit, but caught themselves later in the zone. With a distracting task, this occurred in one in ten zones, compared to one in a hundred without a distracting task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that improving road safety is not only about changing attitudes, but also about considering drivers’ cognitive limitations, which gives some credence to the pleas of ignorance made by 20 to 50 per cent of drivers fined for speeding. Planners should think carefully about how speed changes intersect with focus-grabbing interruptions. And we should be aware that a stop in traffic isn’t always an opportunity to daydream, change the radio, or fiddle with the satnav. The road is a complicated place, and deserves our full attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology is overly dependent on student samples, but on the plus side, you might assume that one advantage of comparing across student samples is that you can rule out the influence of complicating background factors, such as differences in average personality profile. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12224/abstract&quot;&gt;writing in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a team of US researchers led by Katherine Corker at Kenyon College has challenged this assumption: their findings suggest that if you test a group of students at one university, it’s not safe to assume that their average personality profile will match that of a sample of students from a university elsewhere in the same country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-22245&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corker and her colleagues measured the personality of over 8,500 students studying a range of majors (including psychology, business and nutrition) at 30 colleges and universities across 20 different US states. They found some significant differences in average student personality between different sites. The amount of difference that was explained by the site of testing was modest – about 1 to 3 per cent – but Corker and her colleagues said that this “should not be dismissed as necessarily trivial or unimportant”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the site-specific effects, larger universities tended to have more extraverted students; more urban and diverse universities had more open-minded students;  universities requiring letters of recommendation had more agreeable students; public colleges had less agreeable students than private colleges; and more expensive colleges had higher trait Neuroticism. Differences like these could reflect students with particular personality profiles being drawn to particular institutions; selection could be at play, in the sense of university selectors showing a preference for particular personality types; and also students’ personalities could be shaped by the culture of their university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All told, these results suggest there is more variability between students at different colleges and universities than some researchers might have expected,” Corker and her team said, though they warned their colleagues not to leap to this finding as an explanation for the replication crisis in psychology (the difficulty labs often have in trying reproduce earlier findings reported by researchers based at another institution), at least not until there is more data and a thorough theory in place to account for the site differences in personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a shame the current research didn’t include students studying a more diverse set of subjects, but if anything, this makes it likely the observed between-institution differences are an underestimate. Perhaps for now the lesson to take is that if you’re comparing data from two sets of students at different institutions, it’s unwise to be overconfident about how similar they are likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 Despite the success of monotherapies based on blockade of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) in human melanoma, most patients do not experience durable clinical benefit. Pre-existing T-cell infiltration and/or the presence of PD-L1 in tumours may be used as indicators of clinical response; however, blood-based profiling to understand the mechanisms of PD-1 blockade has not been widely explored. Here we use immune profiling of peripheral blood from patients with stage IV melanoma before and after treatment with the PD-1-targeting antibody pembrolizumab and identify pharmacodynamic changes in circulating exhausted-phenotype CD8 T cells (Tex cells). Most of the patients demonstrated an immunological response to pembrolizumab. Clinical failure in many patients was not solely due to an inability to induce immune reinvigoration, but rather resulted from an imbalance between T-cell reinvigoration and tumour burden. The magnitude of reinvigoration of circulating Tex cells determined in relation to pretreatment tumour burden correlated with clinical response. By focused profiling of a mechanistically relevant circulating T-cell subpopulation calibrated to pretreatment disease burden, we identify a clinically accessible potential on-treatment predictor of response to PD-1 blockade.

 &lt;p&gt;The week at Retraction Watch featured a predatory journal sting involving a fake disorder from Seinfeld, and a study with disturbing findings about how retracted papers are cited. Here’s what was happening elsewhere: “Openness and reproducibility may be core to how science works, but they can be misused or turned into ways of pursuing ideological attacks,” […]&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 A case of left-right confusion misled researchers about how dogs process language.

Last August, Hungarian neuroscientists Atilla Andics and colleagues reported that the left hemisphere of the dog brain is selectively activated in response to the lexical properties (i.e. the meaning) of spoken words. This result was very interesting, not least because lexical processing is also lateralized to the left hemisphere in most humans. The paper appeared in the prestigious journal Science.

		<updated>2017-04-07T15:00:22+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Greetings from the AACR Annual Meeting!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This year, we heard Joe Biden’s report on the progress of the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot Initiative, compared immuno-oncology combination therapies, and mulled over the use of CRISPR screening to finding epigenetically controlled loci.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_1049&quot; style=&quot;width: 181px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1049 &quot; height=&quot;228&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Biden-225x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;171&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Joe Biden delivers the Cancer Moonshot Initiative update at AACR 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We also checked out the groundbreaking research being done by service providers on the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scienceexchange.com?utm_source=wordpress&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=aacr2017&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Science Exchange network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. Their work directly addresses the recommendations made last fall by the Moonshot’s Blue Ribbon Panel, and we are excited to give cancer researchers rapid access to these technologies through the Science Exchange platform!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Here are a few highlights from our exploration of #AACR17:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;First humanized mouse model of tumor growth in bone: Pharmatest and Taconic Biosciences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Moonshot Initiative’s recommendations specifically called out the potential of humanized mouse models to recapitulate the cellular architecture and heterogeneity found in human tumors. Traditional preclinical models that lack functional interactions between tumor, immune system and microenvironment have not been effective at predicting safety and efficacy of immunomodulating cancer drugs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_1051&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1051 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Taconic-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Taconic Biosciences showcases its novel animal models at AACR 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/pharmatest-services-ltd?utm_source=wordpress&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=aacr2017&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Pharmatest Services, Ltd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/taconic-biosciences?utm_source=wordpress&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=aacr2017&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Taconic Biosciences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, both leaders in the development of predictive animal models, presented a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4292/presentation/12085&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;poster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; at AACR 2017 showing the proliferation of human breast cancer cells in the bone injection site of humanized mice. The observed tumor growth, bone remodeling, and infiltration by human immune cells were similar to that seen in human breast cancer patients suffering from bone metastases. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Validation of this mouse model would be a very promising development for preclinical testing of immuno-oncology drug candidates and combination therapies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mass spectrometry imaging to characterize tumor microenvironment: Imabiotech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_1052&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1052 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Imabiotech-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Imabiotech’s novel mass spectrometry imaging technology provides better toxicity and efficacy assessments in a number of therapeutic research areas, including immuno-oncology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One challenge facing the Cancer Moonshot Initiative is that novel technologies are required to address tumor heterogeneity (at the cellular and molecular levels). Thus, the Blue Ribbon Panel called out multiplexed, quantitative imaging as a promising way to connect function with localization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/imabiotech-corp?utm_source=wordpress&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=aacr2017&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Imabiotech Corporation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; is a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/imabiotech-corp?utm_source=wordpress&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=aacr2017&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;widely-published&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; expert in the emerging field of mass spectrometry imaging, which is a promising technology to address tumor heterogeneity. Their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4292/presentation/1571&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;poster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and exhibit at AACR 2017 showcased how mass spectrometry imaging could be used to quantitatively characterize responses to immunotherapy in the tumor microenvironment, with spatial resolution. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Toward 3D patient-derived models of breast cancer, lung cancer, and glioblastoma: KIYATEC, Inc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Another of the most challenging aspects of oncology is the fact that each patient has a different response to a particular therapy. Recognizing this, the Moonshot Initiative’s recommendations included a call to establish patient-derived test models, such as organoids and xenografts, in which candidate drugs could be tested before treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_1050&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1050 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/KIYATEC-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;KIYATEC presents 3D cell-based models for drug response profiling at AACR 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/kiyatec-inc?utm_source=wordpress&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=aacr2017&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;KIYATEC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, whose expertise lies in generating and using 3D cell-based models for drug response profiling, presented their work on breast cancer, lung cancer, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4292/presentations/kiyatec/1&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;three posters &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;at AACR 2017.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;One study addressed the challenges facing small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients, for whom surgical resection is rarely feasible. Therefore, patient-derived tissue is difficult to obtain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/kiyatec-inc?utm_source=wordpress&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=aacr2017&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;KIYATEC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; was able to isolate functional cancer stem cells and circulating tumor cells, label-free, from SCLC patients, with the aim of developing 3D microtumors from these cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/kiyatec-inc?utm_source=wordpress&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=aacr2017&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;KIYATEC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; also showed that 3D models of breast cancer, which incorporated multiple stromal cell types and immune cells, responded differently to immune checkpoint inhibitors than standard 2D cell culture models. Finally, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/kiyatec-inc?utm_source=wordpress&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=aacr2017&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;KIYATEC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; tackled GBM, for which therapy is particularly confounded by intra-tumor and inter-patient heterogeneity. They developed an efficient method to develop patient-derived 3D models, which may enable more personalized treatments for GBM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental stimulation for domestic cats is important in minimizing stress, which can lead to negative behaviors, and development of disease. There are several recommended methods for feline environmental enrichment, but despite recognition of its importance, olfactory stimulation is often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nepera&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;cataria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, or catnip, is well known. The plant releases a chemical called nepetalactone, identified as the active cause of the euphoric response in cats. However, only around two out of three domestic cats are sensitive to the compound. The majority of big cat species have also been found to respond to nepetalactone’s. Tigers appear to be an exception to this. As nepetalactone is not thought to have any long term or harmful effect, it may be a useful enrichment tool for both domestic cats and big cats in captivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catnip is the only plant containing nepetalactone. &lt;em&gt;Actinidia polygama&lt;/em&gt;, or silver vine, is commonly used as a cat stimulant in Japan and has been found to release several active compounds similar in structure to nepetalactone. Anecdotal reports of other plants which stimulate cats include Tatarian honeysuckle, valerian root, and the fresh roots of the Indian nettle &lt;em&gt;Acalypha indica&lt;/em&gt;. Data on the effects of these plants is scarce, although some similarities in the structure of the chemicals released have been identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent publication in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Veterinary Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Sebastian Bol, molecular biologist and owner of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/CowboyCatRanch/&quot;&gt;Cowboy Cat Ranch&lt;/a&gt; in Texas teamed up with several southern California cat clinics to test three additional plants – silver vine, Tatarian honeysuckle and valerian root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8810&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Some of the plant materials used in this study. a) Tatarian honeysuckle wood b) A dried silver vine fruit gall c) A dried normal silver vine fruit&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8810 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;186&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Cats-LC-300x186.gif&quot; title=&quot;Bol et al., 2017&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Some of the plant materials used in this study.&lt;br /&gt; a) Tatarian honeysuckle wood&lt;br /&gt; b) A dried silver vine fruit gall&lt;br /&gt; c) A dried normal silver vine fruit&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hundred cats were given catnip, silver vine, Tatarian honeysuckle and valerian root, by rubbing the plant matter on a sock or square of carpet and leaving it in the cat’s line of sight. After much patience and careful monitoring, the responses to each of these plants were assessed. A positive response was graded based on a variety of behaviors, including sniffing, licking, rolling, drooling and rubbing. A negative response was determined by no reaction following a minimum of two exposures to the plant. The most popular plant was found to be silver vine, with 80% of the cats showing a positive response – a higher response rate when exposed to Catnip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cats did not appear to favor one plant over another based on gender, age or behavioral category. Interestingly, some cats which didn’t react to catnip would react to one of the other stimulants, with 23 of the cats in the study responding to all four plants. Of the one hundred cats used in this study, only 6 did not respond to any of the compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8809&quot; style=&quot;width: 304px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A female bobcat enjoying some silver vine at Big Cat Rescue, Florida. &quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8809 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Bobcat-LC-294x300.gif&quot; title=&quot;Bol et al., 2017&quot; width=&quot;294&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;A female bobcat enjoying some silver vine at Big Cat Rescue, Florida.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As silver vine and catnip were found to be the most popular in domestic cats, their effects were then assessed in 9 tigers and 5 bobcats at a Florida big cat sanctuary. As expected, the tigers did not respond well to the catnip, with only 1 of the 9 tigers showing interest. When presented with silver vine, almost half of the tigers were actively disapproving and would back away; however, none of the tigers showed a positive response. Contrastingly, the bobcats acted more like the domestic cats when shown silver vine, with 4 out of the 5 responding positively. Only 1 bobcat demonstrated a positive response to the catnip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the study does not determine what causes the ‘catnip’ effect in some cats, the results of this study may be of use to cat owners. Those whose feline companions do not respond to catnip should know that there are alternative olfactory enrichment options available. The use of such plants may be useful in improving quality of life for cats; not only in the home, but also cats placed in potentially stressful environments such as veterinary surgeries, and enrichment of non-domesticated felines in zoos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “testing effect” is well-established in psychology: this is the finding that answering questions about what you’ve learned leads to better retention than simply studying the material for longer. Testing is beneficial because the act of recall entrenches learned material in our memories, and when we can’t answer, this helps us make our future revision more targeted. Less well-known and less well-understood is the effect of “prequestions”: questions pertaining to upcoming information that you attempt to answer before you’ve started learning that information. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211368116301103?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition&lt;/em&gt; suggests that answering prequestions may be a simple and effective way to boost your learning from videos and perhaps short lectures too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-22260&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shana Carpenter and Alexander Toftness asked 85 students to watch a short video about the history of Easter Island. The video was split into three segments each of about two minutes length, and before each segment, half the students attempted to answer two prequestions that pertained to the upcoming video content, such as “How many families originally settled on the island of Rapa Nui?” (the students nearly always failed to answer the prequestions correctly and no feedback was given). The other students acted as controls and simply pressed a space bar to continue on to each new video segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the entire video was over, all the students answered the same 12 questions about the history of Easter Island as told in the video. For the prequestion group, 6 of these questions were the prequestions they’d attempted to answer earlier, the other 6 questions were new and about different information. For the control group, this was the first time they’d encountered any of the questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post-video test, the prequestion group outperformed the control group, not only in correctly answering more of what had been the prequestions, but also by correctly answering more of the 6 new questions, the ones that they hadn’t seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers think prequestions probably have this benefit because they act as an “orienting device”, directing viewers to look out for specific information, and perhaps also because they reduce viewers’ complacency and overconfidence in their knowledge, thus motivating them to pay more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new findings add to previous research that’s looked at the benefits of prequestions on learning from text, with mixed results. Some past studies have suggested that while prequestions can help the learning of the information targeted by the prequestions, they do so at the expense of other information in the text – perhaps because readers skip through the text to find the answers to the prequestions. However, when readers are encouraged to pay attention to all the reading material (for example, by asking them to rate the comprehensibility of each paragraph), then prequestions have been shown to be beneficial without cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carpenter and Toftness think prequestions may be especially suited to helping learning from videos because it’s not easy for viewers to skip mentally through the video material to find the answers to the prequestions; instead they end up paying more attention to the entire video than they would have done without the prequestions. A similar benefit may occur for short lectures, though perhaps not for longer, complex lectures; the limited evidence on this to date suggests that when the gap between prequestions and to-be-learned material is too great, the benefits may disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need more research to pin down when and why prequestions are likely to be helpful, and how long the benefits might last, and also when they could have costs. Of course another issue from the learner’s perspective is that you ideally need someone to compose some suitable prequestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://ed.ted.com&quot;&gt;TED-Ed&lt;/a&gt; educational video site, all the videos (including this one I prepared earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-are-we-so-attached-to-our-things-christian-jarrett&quot;&gt;on the psychology of ownership&lt;/a&gt;) come with a set of complementary questions to answer after you’ve finished watching. These new results on the benefits of prequestions suggest that perhaps you should try answering the questions before you watch the videos, as well as afterwards. Or maybe if TED-Ed hear about this research, they will soon introduce both pre- and post-video questions.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;BMCWordle-620x342&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/BMCWordle-620x342-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biothechnology:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12896-017-0352-7&quot;&gt;Detoxification of food using microorganisms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fusarium&lt;/em&gt; (mold) and other toxigenic fungal pathogens are responsible for contaminating many of the cereal-based foods we ingest.  They also contaminate animal feeds,  so as humans, we are exposed to these pathogens from multiple sources.  The effects range from diarrhea and vomiting to feed refusal, growth retardation, immunosuppression, reduced ovarian function, reproductive disorders and even death. Because of this, there is an urgent need to reduce toxin levels in contaminated foods. The use of detoxifying microorganisms to biodegrade mycotoxins has shown promising results and this study, published in BMC Biotechnology, describes the de-epoxidizing effects of a microbial consortium on toxic fungal pathogens.  This has tremendous implications for improving the quality and safety of our food and animal feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurology:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12883-017-0825-2&quot;&gt;A good tool for assessing pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PainDETECT questionnaire (PD-Q) is a screening tool designed to assess pain of neuropathic origin, such as chronic lower back pain.  It measures 7 aspects of the quality of pain, as well as the time course and whether or not the pain radiates.  In order to validate the measurement properties of the PD-Q as an outcome measure for research and clinical practice, a Rasch analysis was conducted. The results supported the PD-Q, excluding the time course and radiating measurements, and confirmed PD-Q as a useful tool for clinicians who wish to screen for chronic pain at baseline, and then track it over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroscience:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12868-017-0349-0&quot;&gt;The neural activity of dance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dance movements require the transformation of multisensory inputs into complex and reproducible motor outputs.  This aim of this study was to measure the impact of familiarity on EEG activity and confidence ratings.  This was done by modulating and comparing the brain activity of ballet dancers, dancers from other genres, and non-dancers. The three groups were repeatedly exposed to a video clip of a choreographed ballet sequence and were then asked to visualize performing the dance sequence they just learned.  In addition, they were asked to visualize 12 every day non-dance movements. The findings confirmed evidence for experience-dependent plasticity.  The complex dance sequence required greater cognitive resources than the more familiar movements, lending further support to the concept of dance and motor imagery as an effective therapeutic intervention for individuals with movement disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stereo images of the functional head of the thorax of fossil isopod &lt;em&gt;Urda rostrata&lt;/em&gt; indicate a parasitic lifestyle  and provide crucial information to the understanding of the evolution of parasitism within isopods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychiatry:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1235-0&quot;&gt;The effects of economic recession on mental health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic recession has been shown to cause psychological distress as well as suicidal thoughts.  The aim of this study was to investigate the experience of people who were affected by job loss or financial hardship following the recent 2008 recession as they sought help for their problems. The subjects were recruited from two cities in England, who both experienced a 60% rise in unemployment rates between 2007 and 2012. They were divided into three groups: 1) those who had self-harmed due to financial issues; 2) those who had not self-harmed but were struggling financially; 3) staff from voluntary and state-run organisations. Individuals who had not self-harmed demonstrated more knowledge and access to debt advice than those who had.  Individuals who had self-harmed had less support from friends and family and most had pre-existing mental issues. All three groups shared the view that more practical help for financial issues was needed. These finding underline the importance of identifying those in need and alleviating their anxiety by offering support and advice.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infectious Diseases:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2301-4&quot;&gt;Comparison of diagnostic tools to identify latent TB infection &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to identify individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI), as 5-10% of these will progress to active TB in the course of their life and will become contagious.  At present there is no gold standard in the diagnosis of LTBI although the tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used.  The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature to compare two types of IGRAs to the TST in the diagnosis of LTBI by predicting the progression to active TB in children, immunocompromised individuals, and those arriving from countries with a high incidence of TB.  Based on the results gathered, there was no evidence that IGRAs were better or worse than TST at detecting LTBI.  This underlines the importance of obtaining more data on the sensitivity and specificity of these diagnostic techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cell Biology:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmccellbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12860-017-0132-1&quot;&gt;Shaping sperm in &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATP synthase is a large protein complex found in mitochondria, which catalyzes ATP formation from ADP and inorganic phosphate during cellular respiration. It is typically composed of 16 subunits and peripheral stalk regions.  This study reports on the role of subunit d of ATP synthase in modulating the structure of the Nebenkern within &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; spermatids.  In addition, the study offers evidence that other ATP synthase subunits help shape spermatid mitochondria.   The findings offer additional support to the growing knowledge of the role ATP synthase in membrane conformation in addition to ATP production.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA, USA, 5 March 2017– &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Science Exchange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, the world’s leading marketplace for outsourced research and development, today announced a strategic partnership with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ycombinator.com/about/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Y Combinator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; (YC). YC-backed companies will now have exclusive access to the Science Exchange-powered YC marketplace, where they can instantly order experimental services from a network of over 2,500 qualified scientific service providers, all with pre-established contracts that protect companies’ IP and confidentiality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;YC, best known for its investments in tech giants including Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe, began investing in life sciences companies in 2014 as the need and opportunity to fund early stage companies in this space became increasingly apparent. The Science Exchange partnership addresses the unique needs of these R&amp;amp;D-focused companies, enabling them to compete on an equal footing with Science Exchange’s established global pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients by readily accessing the expertise and infrastructure housed in the Science Exchange network of service providers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Science Exchange marketplace will help YC companies:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #338dc8;&quot;&gt;Expand access to qualified service providers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Life science and biotech entrepreneurs must balance the need to access new, innovative service providers with the time-consuming process required to vet each potential service provider for quality and capability. Science Exchange streamlines this process with a network of over 2,500 service providers that have been pre-qualified through a stringent, ISO 9001-certified evaluation process that includes metrics tied to performance on past projects. Science Exchange additionally supports researchers with an expert Sourcing Team that can recommend the best service providers for each scope of work, further minimizing the risks inherent in outsourcing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #338dc8;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eliminate administrative overhead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Each service provider relationship typically requires a standalone contract that may take months to negotiate and implement. Under the partnership, all service providers on the YC-Science Exchange network are available under a single contract that protects IP and confidentiality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Science Exchange also eliminates the need for YC-funded companies to conduct costly and time-consuming regulatory audits of service providers. Science Exchange’s in-house audit team conducts on-site inspections of service providers and facilities to ensure regulatory compliance, ensuring that contracted service providers possess necessary certifications, licenses, informed consent of subjects, and data security.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #338dc8;&quot;&gt;Save money.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Science Exchange-powered YC marketplace enables companies to quickly identify cost-competitive options and provides access to special offers exclusive to YC-funded companies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;YC is the latest organization to choose to partner with Science Exchange, and joins over 30 enterprise clients using Science Exchange-powered marketplaces to manage their outsourced R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“In the last decade, the landscape for biotech firms has changed dramatically,” said Michael Seibel, CEO of Y Combinator. “Bringing a drug to market, which once took millions of dollars and several years of work because of infrastructure costs involved in building a lab, can now happen in a fraction of the time and funding required because of the ability to outsource R&amp;amp;D. YC invested in Science Exchange years ago because we saw the promise of what they were doing to help companies innovate faster, get important products to market quickly, and reduce the friction inherent in starting a business. Now we are excited to offer these benefits to our companies who have brilliant ideas and are meeting urgent market demands, but need the administrative and cost barriers removed so they can focus on their innovations.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“The Science Exchange platform solves the challenge of R&amp;amp;D outsourcing: we provide scientists with efficient access to a network of highly qualified service providers,” said Dr. Elizabeth Iorns, Founder &amp;amp; CEO of Science Exchange. “We believe, like Y Combinator, that key to advancing groundbreaking research is eliminating the barriers to innovation, and we are thrilled to help YC-funded companies bring potentially life-saving products to market faster.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #338dc8;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Science Exchange&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Science Exchange is the world’s leading marketplace for outsourced research. Science Exchange provides an efficient procure-to-pay platform for ordering services from the world’s largest network of scientific service providers. Through Science Exchange, clients gain access to over 2,500 qualified service providers, all with pre-established contracts in place that protect client intellectual property and confidentiality. This increases scientists access to innovation and significantly improves their productivity because they are freed up from the administrative tasks and delays associated with sourcing, establishing and managing service provider contracts. At an organizational level, the Science Exchange enterprise program enables organizations to consolidate the long tail of research outsourcing spend into a single strategic relationship driving significant efficiency and cost savings. To date, Science Exchange has raised over $30 million from Maverick Capital Ventures, Union Square Ventures, Index Ventures, OATV, the YC Continuity Fund, and others.

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #338dc8;&quot;&gt;About Y Combinator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Y Combinator is a startup fund based in Mountain View, CA. In 2005, Y Combinator developed a new model of startup funding. Twice a year they invest a small amount of money in a large number of startups. The startups move to Silicon Valley for 3 months, and the YC partners work closely with each company to get them into the best possible shape and refine their pitch to investors. Each batch culminates in Demo Day, when the startups present their companies to a carefully selected audience of investors. Y Combinator has invested in over 1,464 companies including Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe, Reddit, Instacart, Docker and Gusto. The combined valuation of YC companies is over $80B.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Biologists have their fruit flies and rats, psychologists have students. An overwhelming amount of behavioral science is conducted with young people at universities on the assumption that it’s safe to generalise from this species of human to people more generally. There are some common-sense reasons for thinking this might be a problem and also some more specific issues, which we’ve documented before, such as that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/06/10/how-burnt-out-students-could-be-skewing-psychology-research/&quot;&gt;burnt out students could be skewing the findings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168354&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt; shows that the ways students differ from the public is different depending on which country you’re in, meaning it’s extra complicated to figure out if and when it’s appropriate to extrapolate student-based findings to people as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-22127&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers Paul Hanel and Katia Vione at Cardiff University used data collected from over 86,000 people (including 6,352 students) in 59 countries as part of the World Values Survey.  They wanted to see if students differed from the general population on various measures, such as trust in strangers, confidence in democracy, morality and personality, and if so, whether this was fairly constant across countries or varied according to whether a country was more individualistic or collectivist (either of which would make it easier to anticipate and account any for student-public differences when conducting research).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers indeed found some notable differences between students and the general public, but perplexingly these differences often varied between countries and they mostly weren’t explained by the key country characteristic of being individualistic vs. collectivist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in New Zealand students showed heightened respect for the elderly compared with the public, but in Australia the opposite was found. In China, students showed more confidence in political institutions than the public, while in Germany, students showed less confidence. Students in the USA saw dishonest behaviours, such as stealing, as more justifiable than the public, but in India, students saw such acts as less justifiable than the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a similar story for personality: for instance, in Colombia students tended to score higher on Conscientiousness than the public, but in Brazil, the reverse was true. However in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/comment?id=10.1371/annotation/9d96e746-28f9-42b7-a37b-c7ca6b4a4698&quot;&gt;comment posted online&lt;/a&gt; after publication of the research, one of the authors said it had come to their attention that the personality measure used in the Moral Values Survey (the BFI-10) was unreliable, and so the results for personality should be disregarded, but he added that “the other seven variables included in our analysis are reliable and can be interpreted as described in the article”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their paper, Hanel and Vione said their results “further support the claim that generalizing from students to the general public within personal and social psychology is problematic, at least while we do not know what predicts those differences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new findings are somewhat disconcerting, but studies of this kind are also very welcome given that psychology’s dependence on student samples is unlikely to end any time soon. Crucially, the more we know about how students tend to differ from the public, the better placed we will be to interpret new student-based findings in an informed and considered way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168354&quot;&gt;Do Student Samples Provide An Accurate Estimate of The General Public?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 A couple of weeks ago, I wrote about a paper describing possibly unethical stem cell injection treatments for children with autism. That paper was published in 2015 in the Journal of Stem Cells.



I've since discovered additional problems with this journal.

It's important to note at the outset that the Journal of Stem Cells is not some obscure operation. It's indexed in MEDLINE, something that the vast majority of 'predatory' journals could only dream of. MEDLINE is the gold standard, or</content>

		<link href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxvi-is-optimization-a-good-metaphor-of-evolution/"/>
		<id>http://romainbrette.fr/?p=1401</id>
		<updated>2017-04-05T08:50:28+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="fr-FR">
 &lt;p&gt;Is the brain the result of optimization, and if so, what is the optimization criterion? The popular argument in favor of the optimization view goes as follows. The brain is the result of Darwinian evolution, and therefore is optimally adapted to its environment, ensuring maximum survival and reproduction rates. In this view, to understand the brain is primarily to understand what “adapted” means for a brain, that is, what is the criterion to be optimized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxiii-on-optimality-principles-in-neuroscience/&quot;&gt;I have pointed out a few difficulties in optimality arguments&lt;/a&gt; used in neuroscience, in particular the problem of specification (what is being optimized) and the fact that evolution is a history-dependent process, unlike a global optimization procedure. An example of this history dependence is the fascinating case of &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/feed/mitochondria&quot;&gt;mitochondria&lt;/a&gt;. Mitochondria are organelles in all eukaryotes cells that produce most of the cellular energy in the form of ATP. At this date, the main view is that these organelles are a case of symbiosis: mitochondria were once prokaryote cells that have been captured and farmed. This symbiosis has been selected and conserved through evolution, but optimization does not seem to be the most appropriate metaphor in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the optimization metaphor can be useful when applied to circumscribed problems that a biological organism might face, for example the energy consumption of action potential propagation. We can claim for example that, everything else being equal, an efficient axon is better than an inefficient one (with the caveat that in practice, not everything else can be made equal). But when applied at the scale of an entire organism, the optimization metaphor starts facing more serious difficulties, which I will discuss now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When considering an entire organism, or perhaps an organ like the brain, then what criterion can we possibly choose? Recently, I started reading “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Guitar-Zero-Musician-Science-Learning/dp/B006ZGO09U&quot;&gt;Guitar Zero&lt;/a&gt;” by Gary Marcus. The author points out that learning music is difficult, and argues that the brain has evolved for language, not music. This statement is deeply problematic. What does it mean that the brain has evolved &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; language? Language does not preexist to speakers, so it cannot be that language was an evolutionary (“optimization”) criterion for the brain, unless we have a more religious view of evolution. Rather, evolutionary change can create opportunities, which might be beneficial for the survival of the species, but there is no predetermined optimization criterion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is the color visual system of bees (see for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfu.ca/~kathleea/colour/docs/Ways%20of%20Colouring.pdf&quot;&gt;Ways of coloring&lt;/a&gt; by Thompson et al.). A case can be made that the visual system of bees is adapted to the color of flowers they are interested in. But conversely, the color of flowers is adapted to the visual system of bees. This is a case of co-evolution, where the “optimization criterion” changes during the evolutionary process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the optimization criterion does not preexist to the optimization process, and this makes the optimization metaphor weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A possible objection is that there is a preexisting optimization criterion, which is survival or reproduction rate. While this might be correct, it makes the optimization metaphor not very useful. In particular, it applies equally to all living species. The point is, there are species and they are different even though the optimization criterion is the same. Not all have a brain. Thus, optimization does not explain why we have a brain. Species that have a brain have different brains. The nervous system of a nematode is not the same as that of a human, even though they are all equally well adapted, and have evolved for exactly the same amount of time. Therefore, the optimization view does not explain why we speak and nematodes don’t, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that “fitness” is a completely contextual notion, which depends both on the environment and on the species itself. In a previous post where I discussed an &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/outline-of-an-existentialist-theory-of-evolution/&quot;&gt;“existentialist” view of evolution&lt;/a&gt;, I proposed the following thought experiment. Imagine a very ancient Earth with a bunch of living organisms that do not reproduce but can survive for an indefinite amount of time. By definition, they are adapted since they exist. Then at some point, an accident occurs such that one organism starts multiplying. It multiplies until it occupies the entire Earth and resources become scarce. At this point of saturation, organisms start dying. The probability of dying being the same for both non-reproducing organisms and reproducing ones, at some point there will be only reproducing organisms. Thus in this new environment, reproducing organisms are adapted, whereas non-reproducing ones are not. If we look at the history of evolution, we note that the world of species constantly changes. Species do not appear to converge to some optimal state, because as they evolve, the environment changes and so does the notion of fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the optimization criterion does not preexist to the optimization process, unless we consider a broad existentialist criterion such as survival, but then the optimization metaphor loses its usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Modern tracking devices now allow us to follow the journeys of even the smallest of migratory birds. A geolocator is a device that is fitted on a bird’s back, similar to how we humans do with our backpacks. This tiny gadget, weighing a mere 0.6 g, measures the ambient light intensity and stores the data on board adding a time-stamp to each measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8695&quot; style=&quot;width: 210px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Geolocator with a light stalk and harness (model GDL2.0, Swiss Ornithological Institute).&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8695 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Geolocator-200x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Geolocator with a light stalk and harness (model GDL2.0, Swiss Ornithological Institute).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the bird has completed its migration and returned to the breeding site the following spring, the geolocator can be retrieved and data downloaded. Later, using astronomical algorithms the light measurement data are turned into geographic positions to get the whereabouts of the bird at a particular time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two consecutive seasons in 2013 and 2014, we fitted geolocators on semi-collared flycatchers &lt;em&gt;Ficedula semitorquata&lt;/em&gt; – an insectivorous songbird weighing only 13 g – at a breeding site in Bulgaria. These birds breed in restricted areas in South-eastern Europe and &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10336-016-1334-6&quot;&gt;spend the northern winter in Eastern-Central Africa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spring season of 2014, when the first group of tagged birds returned back to Europe, was exceptionally warm in the Mediterranean Basin and at the breeding site of the flycatchers. In contrast, the spring of 2015 when the second group of tagged birds returned was exceptionally cold, delaying plant phenology for several weeks. Such extreme and contrasting conditions present an ideal opportunity to study phenotypic plasticity in a natural setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that in both years flycatchers started their spring migration in Africa and crossed the Sahara Desert at approximately the same time. However, when reaching the Mediterranean Basin where the first cues for weather and environmental conditions of the temperate regions can be assessed, the flycatchers acted differently in the two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8696&quot; style=&quot;width: 1090px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Semi-collared flycatcher male.&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8696&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Ficedula_semitorquata_male.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Semi-collared flycatcher male.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Martins Briedis&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the warm spring of 2014, birds quickly continued their migration and returned to their breeding sites. On the contrary, in the cold spring of 2015 birds spent a prolonged period in the Mediterranean Basin waiting for improved weather conditions before returning to their breeding sites. Additionally, we observed a lower apparent individual survival in the cold spring year, suggesting that some individuals lacked an appropriate response strategy or may have chosen an inappropriate response to the cold weather. Males and older individuals that typically migrate earlier paid a higher cost and suffered a higher degree of mortality compared to females and younger birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As climate change is predicted to bring an increasing number of extreme weather events, animals’ ability to flexibly adjust their behaviour seems to be an essential necessity for survival. Long-distance migratory birds are especially challenged in their responses to weather extremes as they have limited or no ability to predict the weather at their distant breeding areas while residing in the tropics. The onset of spring migration in long-distance migrants is determined by endogenously controlled circannual rhythms and photoperiod. Combining this internal clock with external cues from the environment while on migration seems to be the appropriate strategy for migrants to withstand the changing climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video below shows the contrast in the progress of tracked birds from their African wintering grounds to their European breeding grounds in the cold spring of 2015 and the much warmer spring of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this era of “fake news” and rising populism, encountering conspiracy theories is becoming a daily phenomenon. Some people usually shrug them off – they find them too simplistic, biased or far-fetched – but others are taken in. And if a person believes one kind of conspiracy theory, they usually believe others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologists are very interested in why some people are more inclined to believe in conspiracy theories, especially since the consequences can be harmful: for example, by avoiding getting their kids vaccinated, believers in vaccination conspiracies can harm wider public health; in other cases, a belief in a conspiracy against one’s own ethnic or religious group can foment radicalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main differences between conspiracy believers and nonbelievers that’s cropped up in multiple studies is that nonbelievers tend to be more highly educated. For a &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3301/abstract?campaign=woletoc&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Applied Cognitive Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, Jan-Willem Van Prooijen at VU Amsterdam has conducted two large surveys to try to dig into just what it is about being more educated that seems to inoculate against belief in conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-22052&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first survey, Van Prooijen recruited over 4000 readers of a popular science journal in the Netherlands, with an average age of 32. He asked them about their formal education level and their belief in various well-known conspiracy theories, such as that the moon landings were hoax; he tested their feelings of powerlessness; their subjective sense of their social class (they located their position on a social ladder); and their belief in simple solutions, such as that “most problems in society are easy to solve”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more highly educated a participant, the less likely they were to endorse the conspiracy theories. Importantly, several of the other measures were linked to education and contributed to the association between education and less belief in conspiracy: feeling less powerlessness (or more in control), feelings of higher social status, and being sceptical of simple solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second survey was similar, but this time Van Prooijen quizzed nearly 1000 participants, average age 50, selected to be representative of the wider Dutch population. Also, there were two phases: for the first, participants answered questions about their education level; feelings of power; subjective social class; belief in simple solutions; and they took some basic tests of their analytical thinking skills. Then two weeks later, the participants rated their belief in various conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, more education was associated with less belief in conspiracy theories, and this seemed to be explained in part by more educated participants feeling more in control, having less belief in simple solutions, and having stronger analytical skills. Subjective social class wasn’t relevant in this survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, Van Prooijen said the results suggest that “the relationship between education and belief in conspiracy theories cannot be reduced to a single psychological mechanism but is the product of the complex interplay of multiple psychological processes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of his study means we can’t infer that education or the related factors he measured actually cause less belief in conspiracies. But it makes theoretical sense that they might be involved: for example, more education usually increases people’s sense of control over their lives (though there are exceptions, for instance among people from marginalized groups), while it is feelings of powerlessness that is one of the things that often attracts people to conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, Van Prooijen said his findings help make sense of why education can contribute to “a less paranoid society” even when conspiracy theories are not explicitly challenged. “By teaching children analytic thinking skills along with the insight that societal problems often have no simple solutions, by stimulating a sense of control, and by promoting a sense that one is a valued member of society, education is likely to install the mental tools that are needed to approach far-fetched conspiracy theories with a healthy dose of skepticism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3301/abstract?campaign=woletoc&quot;&gt;Why Education Predicts Decreased Belief in Conspiracy Theories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HSNIGJfOEDo/WNdxjmjEhVI/AAAAAAAAMGI/9GCHvXdCSaYAOnjub8MINjvaZRycZ980QCLcB/s1600/BIG%2BIDEAS%2BCNS%2B2017%2Bwhite.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HSNIGJfOEDo/WNdxjmjEhVI/AAAAAAAAMGI/9GCHvXdCSaYAOnjub8MINjvaZRycZ980QCLcB/s320/BIG%2BIDEAS%2BCNS%2B2017%2Bwhite.png&quot; width=&quot;305&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, the Cognitive Neuroscience Institute (CNI) and the Max-Planck-Society organized a symposium on Big Ideas in Cognitive Neuroscience. I enjoyed this fun forum organized by David Poeppel and Mike Gazzaniga. The format included three pairs of speakers on the topics of memory, language, and action/motor who “consider[ed] some major challenges and cutting-edge advances, from molecular mechanisms to decoding approaches to network computations.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Co-host Marcus Raichle recalled his inspiration for the symposium: a similar Big Ideas session at the Society for Neuroscience meeting. But human neuroscience was absent from all SFN Big Ideas, so Dr. Raichle contacted Dr. Gazzaniga, who “made it happen” (along with Dr. Poeppel). The popular event was standing room only, and many couldn't even get into the Bayview Room (which was too small a venue). More context:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“Recent discussions in the neurosciences have been relentlessly reductionist. The guiding principle of this symposium is that there is no privileged level of analysis that can yield special explanatory insight into the mind/brain on its own, so ideas and techniques across levels will be necessary.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two hour symposium was a welcome addition to hundreds of posters and talks on highly specific empirical findings. Sometimes we must take a step back and look at the big picture. But since I'm The Neurocritic, I'll start out with some modest suggestions for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was no time for questions or discussion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There were too many talks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be nice for all speakers to try to bridge different levels of analysis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a small point, but ironically the first two speakers (Gallistel, Ryan) did not talk about human neuroscience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my idea is to have four speakers on one topic (memory, let's say) with two at the level of Gallistel and Ryan&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and two who approach human neuroscience using different techniques. Talks are strictly limited to 20 minutes. Then there is a 20 minute panel discussion where everyone tries to consider the implications of the other levels for their own work. Then (ideally) there is time for 20 minutes of questions from the audience. However, since I'm not an expert in organizing such events, allotting 20 minutes for the audience could be excessive. So the timing could be restructured to 25 min for talks, 10-15 min panel, 5-10 min audience. Or combine the round table with audience participation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year, &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160611055236/http://www.cogneurosociety.org/mycns/?page=symposium_sessions#7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Symposium Session 7&lt;/a&gt; on Human Intracranial Electrophysiology (which included the &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2016/04/dont-lose-your-head-over-tdcs.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Studies of transcranial electrical stimulation in human cadaver heads showed a 90% loss of current when delivered through the skin&quot;&gt;incendiary tDCS challenge&lt;/a&gt; by György Buzsáki) had a round table discussion as Talk 5, which I thought was very successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Video of the Big Ideas symposium is now available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlFDiU2PVB8DQ1Qf7cGNvRV2HSMOWUBMf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, but in case you don't want to watch the entire two hours, I'll present a brief summary below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Big Box Neuroscience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's an idiosyncratic distillation of some major points from the symposium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The brain is an information processing device in the sense of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;'information' is thought of as a set of possible messages, where the goal is to send these messages over a noisy channel, and then to have the receiver reconstruct the message with low probability of error&quot;&gt;Shannon information theory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The brain does &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; use Shannon information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Memories (”engrams”) are not stored at synapses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We learn entirely through spike trains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The engram is inter-spike interval.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The engram is an emergent property.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Emergent properties are for losers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Language is genetically predetermined.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is something called mirror neural ensembles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recursion is big.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Architectures are important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build a bridge from networks to models of behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use generative models to construct theories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Machine learning will save us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go back to behavioral neuroscience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I'll explain what this all means in the next post.

		<link href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/Mkq1NH1zoK4/nature22035"/>

 &lt;p&gt;
 The angiotensin II receptors AT1R and AT2R serve as key components of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. AT1R has a central role in the regulation of blood pressure, but the function of AT2R is unclear and it has a variety of reported effects. To identify the mechanisms that underlie the differences in function and ligand selectivity between these receptors, here we report crystal structures of human AT2R bound to an AT2R-selective ligand and to an AT1R/AT2R dual ligand, capturing the receptor in an active-like conformation. Unexpectedly, helix VIII was found in a non-canonical position, stabilizing the active-like state, but at the same time preventing the recruitment of G proteins or β-arrestins, in agreement with the lack of signalling responses in standard cellular assays. Structure–activity relationship, docking and mutagenesis studies revealed the crucial interactions for ligand binding and selectivity. Our results thus provide insights into the structural basis of the distinct functions of the angiotensin receptors, and may guide the design of new selective ligands.

 The crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS, the Acanthaster planci species group) is a highly fecund predator of reef-building corals throughout the Indo-Pacific region. COTS population outbreaks cause substantial loss of coral cover, diminishing the integrity and resilience of reef ecosystems. Here we sequenced genomes of COTS from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia and Okinawa, Japan to identify gene products that underlie species-specific communication and could potentially be used in biocontrol strategies. We focused on water-borne chemical plumes released from aggregating COTS, which make the normally sedentary starfish become highly active. Peptide sequences detected in these plumes by mass spectrometry are encoded in the COTS genome and expressed in external tissues. The exoproteome released by aggregating COTS consists largely of signalling factors and hydrolytic enzymes, and includes an expanded and rapidly evolving set of starfish-specific ependymin-related proteins. These secreted proteins may be detected by members of a large family of olfactory-receptor-like G-protein-coupled receptors that are expressed externally, sometimes in a sex-specific manner. This study provides insights into COTS-specific communication that may guide the generation of peptide mimetics for use on reefs with COTS outbreaks.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Growth in terrestrial gross primary production (GPP)—the amount of carbon dioxide that is ‘fixed’ into organic material through the photosynthesis of land plants—may provide a negative feedback for climate change. It remains uncertain, however, to what extent biogeochemical processes can suppress global GPP growth. As a consequence, modelling estimates of terrestrial carbon storage, and of feedbacks between the carbon cycle and climate, remain poorly constrained. Here we present a global, measurement-based estimate of GPP growth during the twentieth century that is based on long-term atmospheric carbonyl sulfide (COS) records, derived from ice-core, firn and ambient air samples. We interpret these records using a model that simulates changes in COS concentration according to changes in its sources and sinks—including a large sink that is related to GPP. We find that the observation-based COS record is most consistent with simulations of climate and the carbon cycle that assume large GPP growth during the twentieth century (31% ± 5% growth; mean ± 95% confidence interval). Although this COS analysis does not directly constrain models of future GPP growth, it does provide a global-scale benchmark for historical carbon-cycle simulations.

 &lt;p&gt;Normal differentiation and induced reprogramming require the activation of target cell programs and silencing of donor cell programs. In reprogramming, the same factors are often used to reprogram many different donor cell types. As most developmental repressors, such as RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) and Groucho (also known as TLE), are considered lineage-specific repressors, it remains unclear how identical combinations of transcription factors can silence so many different donor programs. Distinct lineage repressors would have to be induced in different donor cell types. Here, by studying the reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts to neurons, we found that the pan neuron-specific transcription factor Myt1-like (Myt1l) exerts its pro-neuronal function by direct repression of many different somatic lineage programs except the neuronal program. The repressive function of Myt1l is mediated via recruitment of a complex containing Sin3b by binding to a previously uncharacterized N-terminal domain. In agreement with its repressive function, the genomic binding sites of Myt1l are similar in neurons and fibroblasts and are preferentially in an open chromatin configuration. The Notch signalling pathway is repressed by Myt1l through silencing of several members, including Hes1. Acute knockdown of Myt1l in the developing mouse brain mimicked a Notch gain-of-function phenotype, suggesting that Myt1l allows newborn neurons to escape Notch activation during normal development. Depletion of Myt1l in primary postmitotic neurons de-repressed non-neuronal programs and impaired neuronal gene expression and function, indicating that many somatic lineage programs are actively and persistently repressed by Myt1l to maintain neuronal identity. It is now tempting to speculate that similar ‘many-but-one’ lineage repressors exist for other cell fates; such repressors, in combination with lineage-specific activators, would be prime candidates for use in reprogramming additional cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature 544 245 &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21722&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature21722&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/aM5Xj0YQYIk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Animals constantly assess the reliability of learned information to optimize their behaviour. On retrieval, consolidated long-term memory can be neutralized by extinction if the learned prediction was inaccurate. Alternatively, retrieved memory can be maintained, following a period of reconsolidation during which it is labile. Although extinction and reconsolidation provide opportunities to alleviate problematic human memories, we lack a detailed mechanistic understanding of memory updating. Here we identify neural operations underpinning the re-evaluation of memory in Drosophila. Reactivation of reward-reinforced olfactory memory can lead to either extinction or reconsolidation, depending on prediction accuracy. Each process recruits activity in specific parts of the mushroom body output network and distinct subsets of reinforcing dopaminergic neurons. Memory extinction requires output neurons with dendrites in the α and α′ lobes of the mushroom body, which drive negatively reinforcing dopaminergic neurons that innervate neighbouring zones. The aversive valence of these new extinction memories neutralizes previously learned odour preference. Memory reconsolidation requires the γ2α′1 mushroom body output neurons. This pathway recruits negatively reinforcing dopaminergic neurons innervating the same compartment and re-engages positively reinforcing dopaminergic neurons to reconsolidate the original reward memory. These data establish that recurrent and hierarchical connectivity between mushroom body output neurons and dopaminergic neurons enables memory re-evaluation driven by reward-prediction error.
