 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you’re with your partner at a party and you both get chatting to a stranger. Your partner and the stranger get on really well. Before long, they’re laughing away and ignoring you. Which would hurt most: rejection by the stranger, or by your partner?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The answer, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2021-53161-002.html&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; is that — in the moment, at least — they would hurt the same. It seems that we have such a deep need for affiliation that any form of ostracism triggers similar levels of immediate pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42799&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anne Böckler at Leibniz University in Germany and colleagues asked participants to come to the lab with either a friend of the same sex or a romantic partner (of the opposite sex, in this case). While in a separate room from their friend/partner, they played a screen-based ball-tossing game with what they thought was their friend/partner and a third online player. In fact, the passes from this other “player” as well as the passes that the participant believed their friend/partner to be making were controlled by the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Photographs of the participant, their friend/partner and the third player (who was of the same gender as the friend/partner) were displayed on the screen next to individual icons. By clicking different buttons on the keyboard, the participant could choose who to pass the ball to. But how many times they were themselves passed the ball depended on their experimental condition. “Included” participants received 20 of the overall 60 passes (as would happen if the ball tosses were equally shared). Those who were “excluded by their friend/partner” received 10 passes overall, all from the stranger. Those who were “excluded by the stranger” also received a total of 10 passes, but all from their friend/partner. People in the fourth group were more completely excluded: after receiving two passes at the beginning of the game, they were then ignored.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Immediately after the game, participants completed questionnaires about their mood during and after playing. These revealed that exclusion dampened people’s mood during (though not after) the game, whether they had been excluded by a partner, friend or stranger. Total exclusion had a bigger effect on mood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fully-included participants also scored higher than all the others on measures of “belongingness”, self-esteem, meaningful existence (having a central reason for being), and overall basic need satisfaction. Those who had been fully excluded showed even lower basic need satisfaction than the other groups, though full exclusion did not worsen effects on self-esteem. “Crucially, when comparing exclusions by close other with exclusion by a stranger we found no significant differences for any individual or overall basic needs,” the researchers note. Scores for relationship satisfaction were also lower when the participants were excluded by a stranger, friend, or partner, and lowest among those who were totally excluded. So, while the degree of ostracism clearly mattered, being excluded by a stranger, friend, or partner had the same impacts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a small study, however. And it focused on impacts during and immediately after the game. Rejection by a romantic partner or close friend would surely have longer-lasting effects — even if indirectly, by altering perceptions of the quality of the relationship itself. (I should note that the participants were all debriefed afterwards.) A bigger study might also find impacts on the participants’ behaviour. In this work, exclusion didn’t affect who the participants chose to pass the ball to — there was no evidence that excluded participants tried either to “tend and befriend” their rejector, or stopped passing them the ball.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though this new study is one of the first to simultaneously compare the effects of ostracism by friends/partners vs strangers, earlier studies have found that even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103103001823&quot;&gt;ostracism by a computer&lt;/a&gt;, or someone belonging to a detested group, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-18930-006&quot;&gt;such as the Ku Klux Klan&lt;/a&gt;, has negative effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All of these findings speak to the fundamental nature of the effects of ostracism on our wellbeing. Our ancestors’ lives depended on their having strong social networks — and the drive to have and preserve one, is, it seems, still with us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2021-53161-002.html&quot;&gt;Stranger, Lover, Friend?: The Pain of Rejection Does Not Depend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2021/07/05/the-anti-cancer-effect-of-vitamin-d-is-more-noticeable-in-old-age/"/>

		<updated>2021-07-05T08:18:07+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/two-3258398_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Countries With More UVB Sunlight Have Lower Colon Cancer Rates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you live in a country with more UVB sunlight, you might have an advantage when it comes to risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultraviolet B (UVB) sunlight is used by your skin to make vitamin D, which is anti-carcinogenic. For those of us farther from the equator, we only get a little bit of UVB, usually in the middle of the day (around 10am-2pm, depending on where you live) and during summer months. By comparison, people living in countries closer to the equator are bathed in UVB year-round for most of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12419&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12419&quot; height=&quot;118&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/map_UVB-002-300x118.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;UVB sunlight, with redder shades indicating greater UVB. Data from NASA&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;How Does Vitamin D Prevent Cancer?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D has tons of effects on cells. In cancer research, vitamin D is DINAMIT! This acronym describes the sequence of events at the cellular level when vitamin D is low. DINOMIT spells &lt;em&gt;disjunction, initiation, natural selection, overgrowth, metastasis, involution, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; transition&lt;/em&gt; (see accompanying illustration from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047279709001057&quot;&gt;Annals of Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;). With good vitamin D levels, cells can communicate better with their neighboring cells due to higher production of cadherin molecules. With low vitamin D levels, cells don’t know that they are surrounded by other cells, so they divide uncontrollably, causing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;You Might Not Notice Until You’re Older&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12423&quot; style=&quot;width: 286px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12423 size-full&quot; height=&quot;739&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/blog.png&quot; width=&quot;276&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Garland CF et al. (2009). Vitamin D for Cancer Prevention: Global Perspective. Annals of Epidemiology 19(7):468-483.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; suggests that the anti-cancer effect of vitamin D is hard to notice in people under age 45. In this study, we analyzed the global differences in colorectal cancer, one of the most common forms of cancer. We found that younger people in low-UVB countries had nearly the same rates of cancer as younger people in high-UVB countries. However, when looking at people older than 45, those in low-UVB countries had &lt;em&gt;dramatically&lt;/em&gt; higher rates of cancer than those in high-UVB countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that you don’t need vitamin D until you’re older? Not quite. The cancer-causing effects of low vitamin D take a long time to develop. (In fact, this is a key reason that researchers didn’t see high rates of cancer in low-UVB countries until they looked at older age groups.) Young or old, vitamin D could help you prevent cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What Should I Do If I Don’t Live Near The Equator?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t live near the equator, you may need to take additional steps to ensure you have good vitamin D levels. This can include eating high vitamin D foods (such as fatty fish and dairy) or taking a vitamin D supplement. You can also get a few extra rays of mid-day sunshine, as long as you don’t get sunburned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do live near the equator, you probably don’t need to worry quite as much. However, if you work indoors and rarely go outside, you may want to consider alternate ways to get your vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of where you live, you can ask your doctor to measure your vitamin D levels, or you can order an at-home vitamin D test. &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152441&quot;&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that 40 ng/mL is a good minimum target for cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Olympic Games begin in Tokyo later this month — but things are going to be very different from normal&lt;/strong&gt;. How will the rules and restrictions surrounding the games affect athletes’ wellbeing? &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/tokyo-2021-how-covid-risks-taking-the-fun-out-of-the-games-163307&quot;&gt;Jo Batey takes a look&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Undark has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://undark.org/2021/07/01/podcast-56-brain-extremism/&quot;&gt;fascinating podcast&lt;/a&gt; this week about psychologists’ attempts to understand the minds of extremists.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As pandemic restrictions continue to ease up, you will probably be having more face-to-face conversations than you’ve had in the past year-and-a-half. &lt;/strong&gt;But it’s only natural to find things a bit awkward at first, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22555596/pandemic-social-awkward-conversations&quot;&gt;Tara Well tells Alex Abad-Santos&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re still in the early stages of understanding “long Covid”, the persistent symptoms some people experience after a coronavirus infection and which can include psychological problems such as anxiety and depression&lt;/strong&gt;. Careful research is needed to help people with long Covid, &lt;a href=&quot;https://unherd.com/2021/06/does-long-covid-really-exist/&quot;&gt;writes Stuart Ritchie&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Unherd, &lt;/em&gt;who warns that that these patients are in danger of being “pawns in our debates over pandemic policy”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have developed an algorithm which can predict what kind of art people will like.  &lt;/strong&gt;The programme analysed how the “low-level” features of art like colours and edges related to people’s judgements of the artwork.

 &lt;p class=&quot;has-normal-font-size&quot;&gt;This is the story of how the world travels of a 19th century explorer, two bar magnets and the World War II hunt for enemy submarines led to the invention of the portable fluxgate magnetometer. And how that invention, in turn, led to the “magic profile,” a powerful piece of evidence for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/century/earth-history-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes#birth-of-a-theory&quot;&gt;the theory of plate tectonics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the 1950s, the idea that Earth’s continents might be on the move was largely ridiculed, and the seafloor was still mostly a mystery. But that was about to change: In the aftermath of World War II and its naval battles, researchers suddenly had powerful new tools, such as submersibles and sonar systems, to map and probe the seafloor in greater detail than ever before. Among these new technologies was a small, portable device known as a fluxgate magnetometer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Magnetometers, devices that measure Earth’s magnetic field, were far from a new technology at that point. Scientists had known for centuries that Earth produces its own magnetic field; sailors used compasses to navigate by it. But the strength of that field was puzzlingly inconsistent from place to place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/centennial-logo.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To celebrate our upcoming 100th anniversary, we’re launching a series that highlights some of the biggest advances in science over the last century. For more on the story of plate tectonics, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3095010&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Century of Science: Shaking up Earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-button aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;wp-block-button__link has-society-blue-background-color has-background&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/century/earth-history-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes&quot;&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;During &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/iconic-humboldt-map-may-need-crucial-updates&quot;&gt;his travels around the globe&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1800s, the German explorer and geographer Alexander von Humboldt collected measurements of Earth’s magnetic field at different locations, noting that the field’s intensity increased farther from the equator. Those variations led Humboldt in 1831 to initiate a coordinated effort to precisely measure this magnetic intensity around the world. Among others, he enlisted the help of German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss in this effort.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gauss delivered. In 1833, he reported devising &lt;a href=&quot;http://21sci-tech.com/translations/gaussMagnetic.pdf&quot;&gt;the first magnetometer&lt;/a&gt;, which could measure the absolute intensity of Earth’s magnetic field at any location. His magnetometer was deceptively simple, consisting of two bar magnets, one suspended in the air by a fiber and one placed a known distance away. The deflection of the suspended magnet from geomagnetic north depends on both the intensity of Earth’s magnetic field and the pull of the second bar magnet. These measurements succeeded in providing the first global maps of Earth’s magnetic field strength.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But by World War II, the U.S. Navy was looking for even more precise measurements of magnetism. Specifically, the Navy wanted to be able to map very small anomalies in Earth’s magnetic field — anomalies that might be due, for example, to the presence of metallic objects, such as submarines, beneath the surface of the water.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In 1936, scientists designed such a precise sensor, called a fluxgate magnetometer. In a fluxgate magnetometer, instead of a spinning needle like in a compass, a bar of iron is wrapped in two coils of wire. One coil carries an alternating current along the length of the iron core, tinkering with the core’s magnetic state, first saturating it with magnetism and then desaturating it. When in the unsaturated state, the core can pull in an external magnetic field, such as Earth’s. When saturated, the core pushes the external field back out. The second coil is there to detect those changes in magnetism — and along the way can very precisely measure the strength of the external field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But to use this device to look for submarines, it would have to be portable, able to be mounted on an airplane. That’s where Russian-born geomagnetist Victor Vacquier enters the story. Vacquier was at the Pittsburgh-based Gulf Research Laboratories, an arm of Gulf Oil, where, for several years, he had been hard at work on a portable version of the fluxgate magnetometer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 1941, successful tests of Vacquier’s device drew the attention of the Navy, which saw the defense potential of his device. With naval funding, fluxgate magnetometers were airborne by December 1942 and busily hunting for enemy submarines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the war, scientists were eager to see what this precise, portable magnetometer could reveal about the seafloor. Oceanographers refitted the device so it could be towed behind research vessels as they swept back and forth across the oceans. During the 1950s and early 1960s, Vacquier (by then at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif.) and other researchers began using the fluxgate magnetometer to measure and map magnetic anomalies preserved in the seafloor rocks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;graph of magnetic orientations of seafloor rocks&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100643&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/060421_cg_fluxgate-magnetometer_inline2_680-528x450.jpg&quot; width=&quot;528&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100643&quot;&gt;This zebra-stripe pattern, from data collected in 1966 from the Reykjanes Ridge southwest of Iceland, shows symmetry in the magnetic orientations of seafloor rocks on either side of the central ridge (oriented upper right to lower left).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100643&quot;&gt;F.J. Vine, &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; 1966&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The maps revealed a curious zebra-stripe pattern of magnetic polarity on the seafloor, something never seen in continental rocks. In this pattern, bands of rocks with normal polarity — the north-south orientation corresponding to that of Earth’s current magnetic field — alternated with bands of reversed polarity. These stripes, scientists hypothesized, might be due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-magnetic-field-reversal-mass-extinctions-environment-crisis&quot;&gt;Earth’s magnetic field reversing direction from time to time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even more tellingly, the zebra-stripe pattern turned out to be symmetrical on either side of the long, snaking underwater mountain chains known as mid-ocean ridges. That pattern became one of the most powerful lines of evidence for the hypothesis of seafloor spreading, the idea that as Earth’s crust pulls apart at the mid-ocean ridges, magma wells up to form new ocean crust. As the new crust hardens, its iron-bearing minerals align with the current orientation of Earth’s magnetic field, and the hardening rocks become a new stripe in the pattern.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 1968, about 100 earth scientists met for what was about to become a seminal moment in the story of plate tectonics. At the meeting, a two-day symposium held at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City, geologists Walter Pitman and James Heirtzler of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., presented a profile of magnetic anomalies they had measured in 1966 from aboard the &lt;em&gt;R/V Eltanin&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;graph showing three rows of wavy lines&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100642&quot; height=&quot;497&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/060421_cg_fluxgate-magnetometer_inline1_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100642&quot;&gt;In 1965, scientists aboard the &lt;em&gt;R/V&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Eltanin&lt;/em&gt; traversed the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge towing a magnetometer. One traverse, called &lt;em&gt;Eltanin&lt;/em&gt;-19 (shown), revealed such remarkable symmetry in the magnetic orientation of seafloor rocks that it came to be called the “magic profile.” The pattern from west to east (top line) nearly matches the pattern from east to west (middle line) — revealing the symmetry. The bottom line shows expectations from a computer simulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100642&quot;&gt;W.C. Pitman III, J.R. Heirtzler, &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; 1966&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The symmetry on either side of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge was crystal clear, so perfect that it became known as the “magic profile.” This profile, made possible by a series of inventions over the previous century that culminated in a portable, precise magnetometer, became one of the most convincing lines of evidence for seafloor spreading — and ultimately, for the theory of plate tectonics.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Yet another coronavirus variant has public health officials around the globe scrambling to control its spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The delta variant, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-india-crisis-social-distancing-masks-variant&quot;&gt;first emerged in India&lt;/a&gt;, has now spread to more than 80 countries and is quickly becoming the dominant version of the virus (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/9/21&lt;/em&gt;). In places like the United Kingdom, delta has dethroned the highly transmissible alpha variant, which was first identified in that country, as the most common form of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That rapid spread of the delta variant has forced health officials to react. U.K. officials, for instance, delayed plans to reopen the country, pushing the date back to mid-July. And health officials in Israel, a nation where nearly 60 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, reinstated its requirement that residents wear masks indoors — a public health measure that had been lifted 10 days before. In the United States, places like Los Angeles County &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=3206&quot;&gt;recommend that even vaccinated people still wear masks indoors&lt;/a&gt;. The World Health Organization also urges everyone to continue wearing masks, though the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines that vaccinated people can go without masks in most situations remain in place.     &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Delta poses the biggest threat to unvaccinated people, the latest studies suggest. In the United States, delta is responsible for an estimated &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions&quot;&gt;26.1 percent of cases&lt;/a&gt; across the country. Its prevalence is doubling every two weeks. Narrowing in on regions that include states with low vaccination rates like Missouri and Wyoming reveals that delta is &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions&quot;&gt;already causing the majority of infections&lt;/a&gt; in some places. On July 1, the Biden administration announced that teams of experts equipped with testing supplies and therapeutics would be sent to U.S. hot spots to control outbreaks of delta.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The concern is even greater globally. Just &lt;a href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations&quot;&gt;23.4 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people around the world have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, most of whom reside in wealthy countries. Less than 1 percent of people in lower-income countries have gotten a shot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the delta variant takes center stage amid the pandemic, here’s what researchers know so far.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Delta spreads easily.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is still around because it’s been able to adapt well to spread among humans, says Ravindra Gupta, a virologist at the Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology &amp;amp; Infectious Disease in England.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the alpha variant is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-b117-variant-us-dominant-strain&quot;&gt;somewhere around 50 percent more contagious&lt;/a&gt; than previous versions of the virus, delta appears to have beaten that benchmark (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/19/21&lt;/em&gt;). Data from Public Health England, a U.K. government health agency, suggest that delta may be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/confirmed-cases-of-covid-19-variants-identified-in-uk&quot;&gt;60 percent more transmissible&lt;/a&gt; than alpha.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s pretty concerning,” says Ravina Kullar an epidemiologist at UCLA and a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People who are unknowingly infected with the delta variant are more likely to pass the virus on to someone else, perhaps seven to eight others, Kullar says. “You can just see an outbreak occurring pretty rapidly if someone harbors the delta variant” but is not isolated from others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;The variant can evade parts of the immune system.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The higher chances of spreading delta to other people isn’t the only concern. With delta, “we have a virus that has all these transmission advantages that alpha did,” Gupta says. But delta can also dodge parts of the immune system, which gives it an extra advantage over alpha. “That explains, in our view, why it’s causing problems everywhere,” Gupta says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, antibodies from both recovered and vaccinated people were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-637724/v1&quot;&gt;less potent at stopping delta from infecting cells&lt;/a&gt; than alpha or the original version of the virus from Wuhan, China, Gupta and colleagues report in a preliminary study posted June 22 on Research Square. And when the team analyzed a cluster of COVID-19 cases in health care workers who had been vaccinated with AstraZeneca’s shot at a hospital in India in April, the researchers found that most were infected with delta.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same was true at two other health care centers in Delhi, a hint that delta may be more likely to infect some vaccinated people, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccines-breakthrough-infections-variants&quot;&gt;breakthrough infection&lt;/a&gt;, than variants like alpha (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/4/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;On the whole, vaccines still seem do their job.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even amid the threat of breakthrough infections, vaccinations are so far still protecting people from the worst of COVID-19. One preliminary study, for instance, found that COVID-19 vaccines appear to be less effective against delta than some other variants. But two shots are better than one. A single dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca’s vaccines is around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.22.21257658v1&quot;&gt;33 percent effective at preventing symptomatic disease&lt;/a&gt; for delta infections three weeks after the shot, researchers report May 24 at medRxiv.org. That’s compared with 55 percent effectiveness against alpha.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second dose of Pfizer’s jab, however, raised effectiveness against delta to nearly 88 percent against delta, down from 93.4 percent against alpha. A second dose of AstraZeneca’s shot is around 60 percent effective, down from 66 percent against alpha.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Protection from &lt;a href=&quot;https://khub.net/web/phe-national/public-library/-/document_library/v2WsRK3ZlEig/view_file/479607329?_com_liferay_document_library_web_portlet_DLPortlet_INSTANCE_v2WsRK3ZlEig_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fkhub.net%3A443%2Fweb%2Fphe-national%2Fpublic-library%2F-%2Fdocument_library%2Fv2WsRK3ZlEig%2Fview%2F479607266&quot;&gt;hospitalization is even better&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report June 21 in a separate preliminary study from Public Health England. A single dose of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine was 94 percent effective at keeping people out of the hospital after being infected with delta and one dose of AstraZeneca’s was 71 percent effective. Two doses bumped those numbers up to 96 and 92 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so far, in highly vaccinated places like the United Kingdom and Israel, for instance, the rise in COVID-19 cases hasn’t yet been linked to a large spike in hospitalizations or deaths. But hospitalizations and deaths tend to lag a couple of weeks behind case increases, so time will tell whether those numbers will go up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s also not yet much information on delta and the effectiveness of vaccines like Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s COVID-19 shot, leaving lots of people waiting, Kullar says. One hopeful sign: A preliminary study posted July 1 at medRxiv.org suggests that antibodies sparked by that vaccine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.01.450707v1&quot;&gt;still recognize the variant&lt;/a&gt;. So the shot should still be effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key point, however, is that the more vaccinated people there are, the less likely it is that delta will cause problems in a community. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;But vaccines don’t protect everyone equally.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that young, relatively healthy people who are vaccinated are probably going to be OK. But “we are seeing hospitalizations, and we will see deaths, in people who have been vaccinated who are older, who have underlying conditions,” Gupta says. Not all individuals have the same level of protection from the vaccines. What’s more, children younger than 12 still aren’t eligible for vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kullar agrees, noting that there are still lots of people who are immunocompromised, such as organ transplant recipients or people on cancer treatments, or elderly people who might still be at risk. Many of these people have “gotten vaccinated, they’ve done all that they can. Now, they’re relying on those other people around them to protect them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Experts are watching and waiting for the next variant to appear.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Delta likely &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-mutations-strains-variants&quot;&gt;won’t be the last variant&lt;/a&gt; to pop up amid the pandemic (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/26/20&lt;/em&gt;). While vaccines still protect people now, the chances that a variant that might render them far less effective will emerge goes up as the virus circulates among the unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Variants will continue to emerge as the coronavirus spreads, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said at a June 25 news conference. “That’s what viruses do, they evolve, but we can prevent the emergence of variants by preventing transmission. It’s quite simple. More transmission, more variants. Less transmission, less variants.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dampening spread to give the virus fewer opportunities to mutate is crucial, Kullar says. “Before we thought [alpha] was concerning, now there is the delta variant, which puts [alpha] to shame. What’s to come next?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The time to plan for the future of vaccines amid the spread of new variants that can possibly evade the immune system much more effectively than delta or other current forms of the virus may already be here, Gupta says. “This is not the end of the road.” &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A long-predicted type of cosmic explosion has finally burst onto the scene.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found convincing evidence for an electron-capture supernova, a stellar explosion ignited when atomic nuclei sop up electrons within a star’s core. The phenomenon was first predicted in 1980, but scientists have never been sure that they have seen one. A flare that appeared in the sky in 2018, called supernova 2018zd, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01384-2&quot;&gt;matches several expected hallmarks&lt;/a&gt; of the blasts, scientists report June 28 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Astronomy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These have been theorized for so long, and it’s really nice that we’ve actually seen one now,” says astrophysicist Carolyn Doherty of Konkoly Observatory in Budapest, who was not involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Electron-capture supernovas result from stars that sit right on the precipice of exploding. Stars with more than about 10 times the sun’s mass go supernova after nuclear fusion reactions within the core cease, and the star can no longer support itself against gravity. The core collapses inward and then rebounds, causing the star’s outer layers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-nearby-star-goes-supernova-scientists-will-be-ready&quot;&gt;explode outward&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/8/17&lt;/em&gt;). Smaller stars, with less than about eight solar masses, are able to resist collapse, instead forming a dense object called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/white-dwarf-star-smallest-ever-found-moon-size-most-massive&quot;&gt;white dwarf&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/30/21&lt;/em&gt;). But between about eight and 10 solar masses, there’s a poorly understood middle ground for stars. For some stars that fall in that range, scientists have long suspected that electron-capture supernovas should occur.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;During this type of explosion, neon and magnesium nuclei within a star’s core capture electrons. In this reaction, an electron vanishes as a proton converts to a neutron, and the nucleus morphs into another element. That electron capture spells bad news for the star in its war against gravity because those electrons are helping the star fight collapse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to quantum physics, when electrons are packed closely together, they start moving faster. Those zippy electrons exert a pressure that opposes the inward pull of gravity. But if reactions within a star chip away at the number of electrons, that support weakens. If the star’s core gives way — boom — that sets off an electron-capture supernova.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But without an observation of such a blast, it remained theoretical. “The big question here was, ‘Does this kind of supernova even exist?’” says astrophysicist Daichi Hiramatsu of the University of California, Santa Barbara and Las Cumbres Observatory in Goleta, Calif. Potential electron-capture supernovas have been reported before, but the evidence wasn’t definitive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So Hiramatsu and colleagues created a list of six criteria that an electron-capture supernova should meet. For example, the explosions should be less energetic, and should forge different varieties of chemical elements, than more typical supernovas. Supernova 2018zd checked all the boxes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A stroke of luck helped the team clinch the case. Most of the time, when scientists spot a supernova, they have little information about the star that produced it — by time they see the explosion, the star has already been blown to bits. But in this case, the star showed up in previous images taken by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope. Its properties matched those expected for the type of star that would produce an electron-capture supernova.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“All together, it really is very promising,” says astrophysicist Pilar Gil-Pons of Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Barcelona. Reading the researchers’ results, she says, “I got pretty excited, especially about the identification of the progenitor.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finding more of these supernovas could help unveil their progenitors, misfit stars in that odd mass middle ground. It could also help scientists better nail down the divide between stars that will and won’t explode. And the observations could reveal how often these unusual supernovas occur, an important bit of information for better understanding how supernovas seed the cosmos with chemical elements.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

A deeper understanding of interactions among living things and their environment is also required to manage ecosystem services and prevent the spread of harmful pathogens worldwide. Fueled by recent technological advances, DNA and RNA from environmental samples (eDNA/eRNA) are increasingly being used to help meet this need for knowledge. The application of eDNA/eRNA methods helps us evaluate community composition and answer various questions regarding biotic interactions within and between ecosystems. Furthermore, eDNA/eRNA approaches can provide insights into direct and indirect biotic interactions and various evolutionary phenomena.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Given the actual and potential impacts of eDNA and eRNA technology on the field of ecology,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt; BMC Ecology and Evolution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt; has launched a new Collection to bring together research using eDNA/eRNA approaches to:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Analyse past and present biodiversity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Monitor ecosystem health and dynamics (e.g. pollution response, invasive species detection, species distribution and interspecies pathogen transmission).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Analyse diet and trophic interactions, along with other symbioses (e.g. predator-prey, host-parasite and plant-pollinator interactions).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Detect endangered, rare or cryptic species.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Despite the many and growing strengths of eDNA/eRNA technology, the tool is often reported to have methodological and financial constraints. Such problems include sample collection, sample degradation, inference of spatiotemporal dynamics and taxonomic assignment. Therefore, we also encourage submissions that address technological and economic challenges in applying eDNA and eRNA technology in ecology and conservation biology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Fingers crossed for finding nothing: July marks the main trapping season to check for Asian giant hornets still infesting Washington state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first of these invasive hornets found in North America in 2021, in June, was probably not from a nest made this year, scientists say. So that find doesn’t say how well, or if, the pests might have survived the winter. Yet that hornet shows quite well the relentless risk of newly arriving insects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That initial specimen, a “crispy” dead male insect lying on a lawn in Marysville, Wash., belongs to the hefty species &lt;em&gt;Vespa mandarinia&lt;/em&gt;. Nicknamed murder hornets, these were detected flying loose in Canada for the first time in 2019 and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asian-giant-murder-hornet-sightings-washington-canada&quot;&gt; in the United States in 2020&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/29/20&lt;/em&gt;). Yet the “dry, crispy” male &lt;a href=&quot;https://agr.wa.gov/about-wsda/news-and-media-relations/news-releases?article=32455&quot;&gt;is not part of known hornet invasions&lt;/a&gt;, said entomologist Sven Spichiger at a news conference on June 16.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Testing shows the male “is definitely not the same genetic line as the ones we have found,” said Spichiger, of the Washington State Department of Agriculture in Olympia. Neither the U.S. finds, until now all from Washington’s Whatcom County, nor British Columbia’s on the other side of the border are closely related to the newfound hornet. It’s a separate incursion no one had noticed until now.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This oddball new specimen may help correct the skewed impression that sneaky invasive arrivals are rare. The hornets’ appearance in North America may have been a shock to some, but in reality, worrisome insects show up often, and will probably keep doing so. Fortunately making a permanent home is harder than getting here, scientists say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When news of the Asian giant hornets’ arrival first broke in 2019, one of the people who was not at all surprised at a foreign species was entomologist Doug Yanega of the University of California, Riverside. “It is very fair to say that there are many invasive species,” he emphasizes. “We just got a new African mantis species in California this past year in LA, and the expectation is that it is likely to spread.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But even alarming pest arrivals rarely kick up the fuss prompted by Asian giant hornets. At a peak in hornet news during May 2020, Yanega contrasted the new intruders with the South American palm weevil (&lt;em&gt;Rhynchophorus palmarum&lt;/em&gt;). That big weevil had reached southern California and could “wipe out every palm tree in the state,” according to Yanega. Yet, “there have been ZERO [national] mainstream media reports about this, an insect that seriously threatens to have a VASTLY greater negative impact on the economy and our way of life than those hornets ever will,” he fumed in an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That relentless influx of invading insects may be one reason so few make it into the general news. For instance, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported 31,785 incidents detecting some pest just for fiscal year 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For 2021, to pick just one example of worrisome arrivals that have not gone viral, inspectors at Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia and later at Baltimore/Washington International noticed little brown pests called Khapra beetles (&lt;em&gt;Trogoderma granarium&lt;/em&gt;) in Basmati rice and then in dried cow peas that travelers were trying to bring in from abroad. Officials banned the contaminated foodstuffs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Dulles contraband had the bigger number of living insects: 12 larvae and four adults. Even that tiny number of tiny insects was unacceptable. This is the only insect species that U.S. customs officials act upon even when all specimens are found dead. The beetles nibble stored seeds but will also soil the goods with stray body parts and hairs that can make human babies fed dirty grain quite sick and adults uncomfortable. In 1953, a major California effort started to stamp out infestations of Khapra beetles and eventually preserved crop marketability. But the effort was expensive, costing the equivalent of about $90 million in today’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beetles aside, menacing hornets of other species have shown up before the latest Asian giants, says Paul van Westendorp, an apiculture specialist who now strategizes British Columbia’s fight against &lt;em&gt;V. mandarinia.&lt;/em&gt; In May 2019, just months before the discovery of an Asian giant hornet’s arrival, a &lt;em&gt;V. soror&lt;/em&gt; hornet appeared in Canada. It was “alive, but not for long,” van Westendorp says. “I had a chance to admire that specimen.” Not a frail beast, this species hunts down other insects and has been reported to catch prey as large as a gecko. &lt;em&gt;V. soror&lt;/em&gt; looks very much like a &lt;em&gt;V. mandarinia&lt;/em&gt;, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even Asian giant hornets themselves have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asian-giant-murder-hornet-sightings-washington-canada&quot;&gt;turned up&lt;/a&gt; at least once in the United States before 2020. An inspector in 2016 flagged a package coming into the San Francisco airport holding a papery insect nest but not mentioning insects on the label. The nest held Asian giant hornet larvae and pupae, some still alive when discovered. These and other species of hornets, including the ominously named &lt;em&gt;V. bellicosa&lt;/em&gt;, accounted for about &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/isd/article-abstract/4/3/2/5834678?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;half of the 50 interceptions&lt;/a&gt; of hornets and yellow jackets flagged from 2010 to 2018 at U.S. ports of entry, researchers reported in 2020 in &lt;em&gt;Insect Systematics and Diversity&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only some stowaways will manage to make permanent homes in new territory. Of these, the real troublemakers seem to be a minority. For instance, out of 455 plant-attacking insects that settled into forests in the continental United States, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024587&quot;&gt;62 cause noticeable damage&lt;/a&gt;, according to a 2011 tally from U.S. Forest Service researcher Juliann Aukema and colleagues. Even a few rampaging invasive pests, though, can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/invasive-species-cost-billions-damages-global-economy&quot;&gt;get expensive&lt;/a&gt;. Biologists are throwing themselves into the fight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Relentless as the onslaught of unwanted arrivals is, there’s hope for stamping out the more noticeable invasions if caught early. &lt;em&gt;Vespa&lt;/em&gt; hornets are “very large-bodied and obvious, so people will see them,” says entomologist Lynn Kimsey of the University of California, Davis, one of the authors of the 2020 hornet overview. A &lt;em&gt;Vespa affinis &lt;/em&gt;nest showed up in San Pedro, in Southern California at least a decade ago. However, she says, “it was killed and there’s been no sighting of the species since, as far as I’ve heard.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Catching such intrusions early isn’t always easy, however. The port of Oakland takes in about 1 million shipping containers from overseas a year, but at best U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors can check maybe only 10 percent for stowaway insects, Kimsey says. Add to this all the cargo coming into Long Beach, San Diego and the other West Coast ports — plus all the cargo jets. “What’s amazing is that we don’t see more invasives,” she says. “I think this tells you how hard it is for exotic species to get established.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They’ll keep arriving though. All the more reason to keep an eye out for something funny on the lawn, even if it’s just a withered nugget.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;As one of Japan’s most active volcanoes, Sakurajima often dazzles with spectacular displays of volcanic lightning set against an ash-filled sky. But the volcano can also produce much smaller, invisible bursts of electrical activity that mystify and intrigue scientists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, an analysis of 97 explosions at Sakurajima from June 2015 is helping to show when eruptions produce visible lightning strokes versus when they produce the &lt;a href=&quot;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL092323&quot;&gt;mysterious, unseen surges of electrical activity&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report in the June 16 &lt;em&gt;Geophysical Research Letters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These invisible bursts, called vent discharges, happen early in eruptions, which could allow scientists to figure out ways to use them to warn of impending explosions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-lightning-forges-tiny-glass-balls-airborne-ash&quot;&gt;volcanic lightning&lt;/a&gt; can form by silicate charging, which happens both when rocks break apart during an eruption and when rocks and other material flung from the volcano jostle each other in the turbulent plume (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/3/15&lt;/em&gt;). Tiny ash particles rub together, gaining and losing electrons, which creates positive and negative charges that tend to clump together in pockets of like charge. To neutralize this unstable electrical field, lightning zigzags between the charged clusters, says Cassandra Smith, a volcanologist at the Alaska Volcano Observatory in Anchorage.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Experiments have shown that you can’t get lightning without some amount of ash in the system, Smith says. “So if you’re seeing volcanic lightning, you can be pretty confident in saying that the eruption has ash.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vent discharges, on the other hand, are relatively newly detected bursts of electrical activity, which produce a continuous, high-frequency signal for seconds — an eternity compared with lightning. These discharges can be measured using specialized equipment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By focusing on small explosions from Sakurajima, defined as those with plume heights of 3 kilometers or less and with a duration of less than five minutes, Smith and colleagues examined silicate charging, plume dynamics and the relationship between volcanic lightning and vent discharges. As expected, the team found that lightning at Sakurajima occurred in plumes replete with ash. Vent discharges, however, occurred only when ash-rich plumes with volcanic lightning rocketed skyward at velocities greater than about 55 meters per second.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Once you get to a certain intensity of eruption,” Smith says, “you’re going to see these vent discharges.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Monitoring these discharges could be especially helpful for quickly spotting eruptions that have a lot of ash in them. Tracking ash is vital, Smith says, “because that’s what’s dangerous for aviation and local communities” in many instances. Electrical activity, she says, signals an ash-rich plume no matter the weather or time of day, and vent discharges provide a measure of an eruption’s intensity, which could help observatories model where a plume might go.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tracking lightning and vent discharges could cover gaps left by other ways of monitoring volcanoes, says Chris Schultz, a research meteorologist at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. Seismologists track underground movements of magma to look for signs of an impending eruption, for example. Infrasound is used to indicate when an explosion has occurred, but the technique doesn’t differentiate between ash versus gas in eruptions. And satellites collect data on eruptions, though in many cases that’s dependent on good weather at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lightning and vent discharges, Schultz says, may also eventually provide early warnings, especially prior to larger ash-rich eruptions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Poverty &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/03/the-psychological-impacts-of-poverty-digested/&quot;&gt;can have long-lasting psychological effects&lt;/a&gt;. But for people who live above the poverty line, expectations about how much money we should have or need, as well as decisions about what to spend our money on and what to save for the future, can all affect psychological wellbeing, too. However, some well-worn ideas about this are being challenged, as we explore here.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42762&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it true that money can’t buy you happiness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Received wisdom is that it can’t — at least, so long as your income already covers your basic needs plus a few conveniences, such as a car, perhaps. But according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2016976118&quot;&gt;a recent paper in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this is not correct. Matthew A. Killingsworth at the University of Pennsylvania analysed data from more than 33,000 employed adults in the US, who had been asked to report on their own wellbeing at random timepoints via a smartphone app. Contrary to the findings of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489?ijkey=91bd6b154afe6f351d7ae35c292086aac094d6d7&amp;amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha&quot;&gt;some highly influential earlier work&lt;/a&gt;, the analysis of over 1.7 million reports found no evidence for a “wellbeing plateau” above an income level of US$75,000 a year. Instead, Killingsworth found that wellbeing rose with income, with incomes in this study ranging from US$15k a year to over US$480,000. “This suggests that higher incomes may still have potential to improve people’s day-to-day wellbeing,” even in wealthy countries, he writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, it’s worth stressing that the data shows that wellbeing increases by a similar amount every time income is &lt;em&gt;doubled&lt;/em&gt; — so an increase of $30,000 to $60,000, for example, is associated with a much bigger rise in happiness than an increase of $120,000 to $150,000.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should you buy to maximise happiness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not more &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt;, according to most research — but there’s a caveat to this, which we’ll get to shortly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Certainly, there’s plenty of evidence that buying experiences rather than possessions makes for greater wellbeing. For example, in 2020, a team that included Killingsworth but which was led by Amit Kumar at the University of Texas, Austin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103119305256?via=ihub&quot;&gt;reported a study&lt;/a&gt; of 2,635 US-based adults, who received regular texts during the day asking about their current emotions and any purchases. The researchers found that people were happier when spending on experiences, such as attending a sporting event or eating at a restaurant, than when buying goods that cost the same amount, such as jewellery or clothing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5dd05454f1a7771855d537b7/t/5deed996f9cab80768057751/1575934359616/Hershfield_Mogilner_Barnea_InPress_SPPS.pdf&quot;&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/em&gt;, reported that although most people say they would choose to have more money over more time, participants who chose money reported being happier (the participants’ household income and free time were taken into account in this analysis). The team did also find that happier people are more likely to choose more time vs more money. But their analysis suggests that the effect does work in both directions, with a prioritization of time vs money and greater happiness boosting each other. (The participants in this study were thousands of Americans representing a range of ages, income levels and occupations.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, there is also evidence that buying experiences and time really only makes you happier than buying objects &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you’re already reasonably well-off, compared with those around you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/09/04/the-experiential-advantage-is-not-universal-the-less-well-off-get-equal-or-more-happiness-from-buying-things/&quot;&gt;As we reported in 2018,&lt;/a&gt; research (yet again in the US) has shown that less well-off people get just the same — if not more — happiness from buying objects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does income disparity affect happiness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People living in areas where incomes are more similar tend to report greater wellbeing — and this holds not just for overall high-income regions, such as Scandinavian countries, but regions where money &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0244569&quot;&gt;isn’t used much at all&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of research finding that it’s not so much how much we earn (above a basic level) but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5705943/&quot;&gt;how much we earn &lt;em&gt;compared with those around us &lt;/em&gt;that affects wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;. In one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5705943/&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; of this, a pair of researchers analysed decades worth of data from the US and also several western European countries, including the UK. They found that, in Europe especially, rising levels of income inequality were associated with &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; levels of happiness — up to a critical point. Beyond that point, happiness dropped.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers think that limited inequality is encouraging — people see that some social mobility is possible and expect that they might achieve it themselves. However, when income inequality becomes too high, “more aspiring individuals may replace their upward mobility dream with despair and feel jealous of the rich”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Too high” was notably higher for the US than for Europe. The researchers think this could be because even though there is lower social mobility and also greater income inequality in the US compared with western Europe, Americans are greater believers in the possibility of social mobility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One last note on income inequality: highlighting it can of course be important. Certainly, there’s work finding that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/14/visible-reminders-of-inequality-can-raise-support-for-taxing-the-wealthy/&quot;&gt;visible reminders of inequality can make disadvantaged people more likely to want to do something about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about giving money away….&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Throughout human history and across cultures, humans have helped one another in times of need — that, at least, is the message from the influential &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.humangenerosity.org&quot;&gt;Human Generosity Project&lt;/a&gt;. Anthropological studies of a wide range of communities suggest that we are generous by nature. Though this research has focused on generosity within communities, we are of course also motivated to give anonymously, in the form of charitable donations. Studies in this field have found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/10-012_0350a55d-585b-419d-89e7-91833a612fb5.pdf&quot;&gt;giving boosts happiness, and also that happier people give more&lt;/a&gt;, creating a virtuous spiral of increasing benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other studies have investigated the factors that influence our decisions to give to charities. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11852-z&quot;&gt;2019 paper in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which analysed millions of dollars of donations given via the GoFundMe Platform, found that donors gave significantly more to people who shared their surname. Also, men and women donated more at times when donors of the opposite sex were visible on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That same year, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/03/giving-people-simple-moral-nudges-encourages-them-to-donate-much-more-to-charity/&quot;&gt;reported on a study&lt;/a&gt; finding that simple “moral nudges” encourage people to donate much more to charity. Nudging people to reflect on what was the morally “right thing” to do increased actual donations by close to half.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;….And keeping hold of it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You really want to save for a deposit on a flat, or for your retirement — but that ridiculously expensive dress, or shirt, or holiday is just &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; appealing. Most of us have experienced feelings like this. It is much harder to put money away for the future than it is to spend it now. Finding ways to close the gap that we feel between our present and future selves should help, in theory. And a questionnaire that got participants in Portugal to think more about their own future ageing did prompt them to invest more in retirement funds, reports &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12516&quot;&gt;a 2018 study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other groups have looked at different practical ways to encourage people to save. In 2020, a team led by Hal Hershfield at UCLA reported a study of thousands of new users of a financial technology app. They found that suggesting smaller, more regular deposits vs larger, less regular ones encouraged less well-off people to save. In this US study, three times as many people in the highest, compared with the lowest, income bracket signed up to make a $150 deposit each month. When this was framed as $5 per day instead, the difference in participation was eliminated (even though the total savings for each individual were, of course, the same).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s also evidence that some personality traits put you at greater risk of financial hardship and even bankruptcy. Perhaps surprisingly, one of these traits is agreeableness. The reason, according to the team behind this &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/pspp0000220&quot;&gt;2018 report&lt;/a&gt;, is that agreeable people value money less, and so are more likely to mismanage their own. “The relationship was much stronger for lower-income individuals, who don’t have the financial means to compensate for the detrimental impact of their agreeable personality,” commented co-author Joe Gladstone at UCL.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article also appears in the summer issue of &lt;/em&gt;The Psychologist &lt;em&gt;magazine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-dung-poop-dinosaur-reptile-ancestor-new-beetle-species"/>

		<updated>2021-06-30T15:14:58+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;In a fossilized chunk of ancient reptilian poo, scientists have uncovered complete specimens of a new beetle species. The finding, described June 30 in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00674-6&quot;&gt;fossilized dung could contain more details about past life&lt;/a&gt; than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such ancient feces have been “largely overlooked,” says evolutionary biologist Martin Qvarnström of Uppsala University in Sweden. “But they often contain very well-preserved fossils. They’re like hidden treasure chests.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fossilized dung, also known as coprolite, can reveal insights about the diets of extinct creatures that body fossils can’t. For example, coprolites have been used to show that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shhhh-some-plant-eating-dinos-snacked-crunchy-critters&quot;&gt;some dinosaurs with plant-based diets also ate crustaceans&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/21/17&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Feces, especially from carnivores, can readily form into coprolites because the excrement often contains the raw materials and bacteria needed for mineralization, says paleontologist Karen Chin of the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved in the study. Laboratory experiments have shown that poo can become a coprolite in just weeks, saving any delicate structures within as the dung is buried over time. “If you didn’t get rapid mineralization, the feces would get flattened, but most coprolites are three-dimensional,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Despite this preservation power, coprolites can be overshadowed by amber, a translucent tree resin, when it comes to fossils. Some of the most well-preserved, three-dimensional insect fossils are found in amber. But since the resin became common only around 130 million years ago, amber-preserved insects older than that are rare.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Curious whether much older, fossilized poop could match the fossil quality of amber specimens, Qvarnström and colleagues used a synchrotron, which generates powerful X-rays, to peek inside a coprolite from Poland. The dung likely comes from an extinct dinosaur relative called &lt;em&gt;Silesaurus opolensis&lt;/em&gt;, which lived around 237 million to 227 million years ago during the Triassic Period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;3D rendering of beetle remains in fossilized dung&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100955&quot; height=&quot;569&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/062921_no_coprolites_inline1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100955&quot;&gt;This computer rendering of newly analyzed fossilized dung shows beetle remains (tan), beetle wing covers (orange), fungal fibers (gray) and algae (green).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100955&quot;&gt;M. Qvarnström &lt;em&gt;et al/Current Biology&lt;/em&gt; 2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The synchrotron scan revealed whole beetle fossils that rival the quality of similar specimens in amber, along with fragments of the same kind of beetle. The whole beetles’ fossilized exoskeletons lacked the joints needed for classification, but by piecing together the fragmented beetles, the researchers were able to reconstruct these features. As a result, the team identified the insects as a new family and species of beetle, named &lt;em&gt;Triamyxa coprolithica.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qvarnström hopes more paleontologists will begin to recognize how useful coprolites can be. “This dinosaur ancestor was doing a bit of the fieldwork for us,” he says. “We wouldn’t have been able to find these insects otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In a one-two punch, a malaria vaccine in development pairs a shot of the live parasite that causes the disease with a whammy of infection-fighting drugs to immediately quell it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The candidate is the latest vaccine to show promise against a formidable foe, bolstering hopes that an effective shot might be on the horizon. Malaria, a disease caused by the parasite &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/em&gt;, affects more than 200 million people around the world every year. In 2019, an estimated 409,000 people died from the mosquito-borne disease, 67 percent of whom were children younger than 5.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The live parasite vaccine and drug combo showed 87.5 percent efficacy in a small group of healthy adult participants, researchers reported June 30 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. The live parasite shot — which is followed by a dose of one of two anti-malarial drugs to eliminate the infection — not only protected people from the same strain included in the vaccine, but most people could also fend off a different parasite strain that circulates in Brazil.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the results hold up in a larger study, “it would be fantastic,” says Wilfred Ndifon, a mathematical biologist at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Kigali, Rwanda, who was not involved in the study. Even as newly emerging diseases like COVID-19 have killed millions and martialed global attention and resources, “we are still falling short of controlling the ones that already exist,” Ndifon says.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Currently there is only one malaria vaccine, called RTS,S, in use in Africa that provides partial protection in young children. Rather than live parasites, the shot uses a key malaria protein that helps the parasite infect liver cells to train the body to recognize the pathogen. In a late-stage clinical trial, it prevented 39 percent of malaria cases among children 5 to 17 years old. Now, it’s given to children in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme&quot;&gt;Ghana, Malawi and Kenya as part of a pilot program&lt;/a&gt; through the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another malaria vaccine candidate called R21 was designed to improve protection by helping the body better home in on attacking that same malaria protein. That jab recently showed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00943-0/fulltext&quot;&gt;77 percent efficacy&lt;/a&gt; among 450 children in Burkina Faso, researchers reported May 15 in the&lt;em&gt; Lancet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;man vaccinates a baby laying in a mother's lap&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100947&quot; height=&quot;652&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/062921_eg_malaria-vaccine_inine1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100947&quot;&gt;Robert Kapininga, a nurse assistant, gives baby Lusitana the first dose of the world’s first malaria vaccine. The vaccine, called RTS,S, is currently in use in Ghana, Malawi and Kenya as part of a World Health Organization pilot program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100947&quot;&gt;WHO/ M. Nieuwenhof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the world is in desperate need of good malaria vaccines. And using live organisms to protect people is “the oldest way of making a vaccine,” says Patrick Duffy, a malaria vaccine researcher at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md. Shots for diseases like measles and chickenpox also rely on using live, albeit weakened, viruses to teach the immune system what to attack.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Duffy and his colleagues gave 44 healthy people in the United States three intravenous doses of the vaccine spaced about a month apart. Another 12 people were included as controls. Two or three days after the shot, vaccinated participants took one of two anti-malaria drugs — pyrimethamine and chloroquine — to weaken and eliminate the parasite.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taking anti-malaria drugs is a crucial part of the vaccination process. That’s because “these malaria parasites in the vaccine are fully infectious,” says David Cook, an infectious diseases physician also at NIAID. “If we weren’t to give [participants] any medication at all, people would develop a malaria infection.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;infects a new host, sporozoites — the life stage of the parasite that is transmitted from mosquitoes — first attack the liver. Then the parasite bursts into the bloodstream, infecting red blood cells and causing symptoms like fever, headache or chills. Pyrimethamine curbs the infection in the liver; chloroquine tackles parasites in the blood. So while participants who got chloroquine might develop malaria symptoms, those who get pyrimethamine wouldn’t, Cook says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A low-dose vaccine with around 51,200 sporozoites followed up with chloroquine protected four out of five participants when they were exposed to the parasite three months after the last dose. A dose of pyrimethamine protected only two out of nine people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Increasing the amount of parasite in each dose to 200,000 sporozoites, however, bolstered immune defenses. Seven out of eight people, or 87.5 percent, who got a high-dose shot and then took pyrimethamine were protected when exposed to the same parasite strain three months later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The higher dose shot also worked against another malaria parasite strain from Brazil, protecting six out of six people who took chloroquine and seven out of nine people given pyrimethamine. That type of cross protection is important because malaria is a diverse parasite, says Kirsten Lyke, a vaccinologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. So people need to mount an immune response that can recognize multiple strains, not just the one included in a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, because the trial was so small, there’s “some degree of uncertainty about whether this approach to vaccinating is highly effective,” Ndifon says. What’s more, getting people to come back to the clinic for three doses plus drug treatments will be a challenge, both Ndifon and Lyke say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some experts “see this as a traveler’s vaccine,” more accessible to those who have the time and resources to follow up with the treatment, says Adrian Hill, a vaccinologist at the University of Oxford and director of the Jenner Institute who is involved with the R21 malaria vaccine. “If you give people [in Africa] a whopping dose of malaria and then for any reason that drug is expired or it isn’t the right drug or they took it too late — who’s going to take responsibility for that?” What’s more, the shot must be stored in liquid nitrogen and is “impossible to [manufacture] at the scale you need to make an impact on malaria” in areas where it naturally circulates, Hill says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ideally anti-malarial drugs like chloroquine and pyrimethamine would be given at the same time as the shot to minimize the chances people will miss treatments, Duffy says. The team has plans to test that regimen in upcoming trials, as well as figure out how long protection might last.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/white-dwarf-star-smallest-ever-found-moon-size-most-massive"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Only a smidge bigger than the moon, a newfound white dwarf is the smallest of its kind known. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The white dwarf, a type of remnant left behind when certain stars peter out, has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03615-y&quot;&gt;radius of about 2,100 kilometers&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report June 30 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. That’s remarkably close to the moon’s approximately 1,700-kilometer radius. Most white dwarfs are closer to the size of Earth, which has a radius of about 6,300 kilometers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The white dwarf’s small girth means, counterintuitively, that it is also one of the most massive known objects of its kind, at about 1.3 times the sun’s mass. That’s because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/white-dwarf-stars-shrink-size-gain-mass&quot;&gt;white dwarfs shrink as they gain mass&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/12/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s not the only very amazing characteristic of this white dwarf,” astrophysicist Ilaria Caiazzo of Caltech said June 28 in an online news conference. “It is also rapidly rotating.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The white dwarf spins around approximately once every seven minutes. And it has a powerful magnetic field, more than a billion times the strength of Earth’s. Caiazzo and colleagues discovered the unusual stellar remnant, dubbed ZTF J1901+1458 and located about 130 light-years from Earth, using the Zwicky Transient Facility at Palomar Observatory in California, which searches for objects in the sky that change in brightness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The white dwarf probably formed when two white dwarfs orbited one another and merged to create a single white dwarf with an extra-large mass and extra-small size, the team says. That convergence would also have spun up the white dwarf and given it a strong magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This white dwarf is living on the edge: If it were much more massive, it wouldn’t be able to support its own weight, causing it to explode. Studying such objects can help scientists understand the limits of what’s possible for these dead stars.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atomic-clock-deep-space-travel-nasa-passed-first-test"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3100924</id>
		<updated>2021-06-30T15:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;An atomic clock that could transform deep-space travel has successfully completed its first test run in space.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NASA’s Deep Space Atomic Clock, which launched on a satellite in June 2019, outperformed all other clocks in space during its first year in orbit around Earth. The clock, DSAC for short, was at least 10 times more stable than clocks on GPS satellites, which makes it reliable enough for futuristic space navigation schemes, researchers report online June 30 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To navigate the solar system today, space probes listen for signals from antennas on Earth and then bounce those signals back. Ultraprecise, refrigerator-sized atomic clocks on the ground measure that round trip time — which can take hours — to pinpoint a spacecraft’s location.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A future spacecraft carrying a toaster oven–sized &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-portable-atomic-clock-could-revolutionize-space-travel&quot;&gt;DSAC&lt;/a&gt; could simply measure how long it takes a signal from Earth to arrive and calculate its own position (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/21/19&lt;/em&gt;). Untethering deep-space navigation from Earth could someday enable self-driving spaceships or GPS-like navigation systems on other planets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DSAC is so stable because it keeps time using electrically charged atoms, or ions, rather than neutral atoms, says Eric Burt, a physicist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Bottling ions within electric fields prevents those atoms from bumping into the walls of their container. Such interactions cause the neutral atoms in GPS satellite clocks to lose their rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By comparing DSAC with the U.S. Naval Observatory’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole-picture&quot;&gt;hydrogen maser&lt;/a&gt; “master clock” on the ground, the researchers found that the space clock drifted about 26 picoseconds, or trillionths of a second, over the course of a day (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/10/19&lt;/em&gt;). That’s comparable to ground-based atomic clocks currently used for deep-space navigation, says DSAC principal investigator Todd Ely, also at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Facial expressions can be hard to read — and not just when someone is experiencing a mild emotion or feels ambivalent. Research has &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/14/facial-expressions-of-intense-joy-and-pain-are-indistinguishable/&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that when we witness someone in the throes of a particularly acute emotional state, like intense joy or pain, we find it hard to pinpoint exactly what they’re feeling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study looks at a similar phenomenon, this time focusing on vocalisations such as laughter, cries, screams and moans. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-88431-0&quot;&gt;Writing in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Natalie Holz and colleagues from the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics find that our ability to identify emotions increases as vocalisations become more intense — but only to a point. When these sounds reach peak intensity, we find it surprisingly hard to classify them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42747&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were split into three groups and assigned different tasks; each involved listening to non-verbal vocalisations representing different emotions and intensities. The first group focused on categorising emotions, assigning one of seven possible affective states to the sounds: anger, fear, pain, achievement, positive surprise, sexual pleasure, or none of the above. Next, participants indicated how intense they felt the emotion was, and how authentic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second group took part in an emotion &lt;em&gt;rating&lt;/em&gt; task, indicating how clearly they could perceive a specified emotion in the vocalisations. And the third group rated the sounds according to their valence (how positive or negative the sound was) and arousal (how calm or intense it was). This group also indicated how authentic they felt each sound was.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the emotion categorisation task, participants were largely able to correctly classify different emotions. Participants were also able to successfully identify how intense an emotion was.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, there appeared to be an intensity “sweet spot” at which participants were most accurate in their classifications. Participants were able to judge emotions more accurately when they were of moderate or strong intensity compared to low intensity — but after this, when the vocalisations reached “peak” intensity, accuracy decreased again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Participants also showed some confusion when it came to categorising sounds as negative or positive. Although they heard an equal number of sounds of each valence, participants often miscategorised positive expressions as negative, particularly at high intensities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, then, the results show that while participants were able to correctly identify intensity and arousal across the sounds, working out the exact nature and emotion expressed became more difficult as intensity reached its peak. This might be the case because of the “relevance” of certain vocalisations. If someone is expressing something at peak intensity, lead author Holz &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/press/press-releases/pressemitteilungen-detail/article/understanding-feelings-when-less-is-more-1.html&quot;&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt;, “the most vital job might be to detect big events and to assess relevance. A more fine-grained evaluation of affective meaning may be secondary”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words, extremely emotionally intense sounds indicate &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; is happening that requires our attention: what it is exactly, in that moment, may be less important and can come later on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Femo0000073&quot;&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have pinpointed clear, objective markers in intense facial expressions that in theory should allow us to determine whether they indicate positive or negative valence. In the moment, however, we frequently fail to do so. Further research could explore the cues that exist in intense emotional sounds, giving an idea of why — and how — we mix up their meaning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-88431-0&quot;&gt;The paradoxical role of emotional intensity in the perception of vocal affect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Effective use of Bash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instructor(s): Felix B. Kern (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/kernfel&quot;&gt;@kernfel&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date/Time: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=CNS%2A2021%3A+Effective+use+of+Bash&amp;amp;iso=20210628T08&amp;amp;p1=179&amp;amp;ah=3&quot;&gt;28 June, 2021 1200 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recording link (subject to change): &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8Qp38g4blU&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8Qp38g4blU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce participants to the tools they need in order to comfortably and confidently work with a Unix/Linux command line terminal.
Unlike graphical user interfaces, which are often self-explanatory or have obvious built-in help options, the purely text-based nature of a command line terminal can be intimidating and confusing to novice users.
Yet, once mastered, the command line offers more flexibility and smoother workflows for many tasks, while being entirely irreplaceable for things such as cluster access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we aim to introduce participants to the concepts and tools they need to confidently operate within a Unix/Linux command line environment.
In particular, the tutorial is developed for Bash (as per the title), which should cover most Linux and MacOS* use cases.
We hope to provide participants with a firm understanding of the basics of using a shell, as well as an understanding of the advantages of working from a command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutorial is aimed not only at novices who have rarely or never used a command line, but also at occasional or even regular users of bash who seek to expand or refresh their repertoire of everyday commands and the kinds of quality-of-life tricks and shortcuts that are rarely covered on StackExchange questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* While MacOS has switched from &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt; as its default shell, &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quo&quot;&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;s operation is sufficiently similar for the purposes of this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A working copy of bash; participants on Linux and MacOS are all set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants on Windows have several options to get hold of a bash environment without leaving familiar territory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gitforwindows.org/&quot;&gt;Git for Windows&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a Git Bash emulation with most of the standard tools you might expect in a Linux/Unix environment, plus of course Git.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternatively, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux&quot;&gt;enable &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WSL2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6&quot;&gt;install Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; as a virtual machine hosted by Windows. Somewhat ironically, this requires at least one use of a command line terminal (though not bash); on the upside, the Linux-on-Windows experience can be a smooth and safe first step into Linux territory.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Basics to refer back to: Operating your bash shell (with key bindings and patience)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The grammar of a shell command line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting around: navigating within and beyond your computer: &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pwd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pushd&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;popd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeing what’s there: &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;, globbing, and strategies for naming your files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File system manipulations: &lt;code&gt;mv&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cp&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rmdir&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ln -s&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;touch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking into files: &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;amp&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;more&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;diff&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text manipulation: &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;uniq&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cut&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;column&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Putting things together: piping and redirection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to do when stuck: &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt;, I need some &lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt; here &lt;code&gt;apropos&lt;/code&gt; of this command…&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version control is a necessary skill that users writing any amount of code should possess.
Git is a popular version control tool that is used ubiquitously in software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hands-on session is aimed at beginners who have little or no experience with version control systems and Git.
It will introduce the basics of version control and walk through a common daily Git workflow before moving on to show how Git is used for collaborative development on popular Git forges such as GitHub.
Finally, it will show some advanced features of Git that aid in debugging code errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session is intended to be a hands-on session, so all attendees will be expected to run Git commands.
A working installation of Git is, therefore, required for this session.
We will use GitHub as our Git remote for forking and pull/merge requests.
So a GitHub account will also be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux users can generally install Git from their default package manager:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fedora: &lt;code&gt;sudo dnf install git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu: &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows users should use &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gitforwindows.org/&quot;&gt;Git for Windows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MacOS users should use &lt;code&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt; to install &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;brew install git&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information on installing Git can be found on the project website: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;https://git-scm.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is amongst the most widely used programming languages today, and is increasingly popular in the scientific domain.
A large number of tools and simulators in use currently are either implemented in Python, or offer interfaces for their use via Python.
Python programming is therefore a very sought after skill in the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial is targeted towards people who have some experience with programming languages (e.g. &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MATLAB&lt;/span&gt;, C, C++, etc), but are relatively new to Python.
It is structured to have you quickly up-and-running, giving you a feel of how things work in Python.
We shall begin by demonstrating how to setup and manage virtual environments on your system, to help you keep multiple projects isolated.
We’ll show you how to install Python packages in virtual environments and how to manage them.
This will be followed by a quick overview of very basic Python constructs, leading finally to a neuroscience-themed project that will give you the opportunity to bring together various programming concepts with some hands-on practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shell (participants on Linux and MacOS are all set; see below for Windows users)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python 3.6.9 or higher (see below for info on installation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants on Windows have several options to get hold of a shell environment without leaving familiar territory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gitforwindows.org/&quot;&gt;Git for Windows&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a Git Bash emulation with most of the standard tools you might expect in a Linux/Unix environment, plus of course Git.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternatively, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux&quot;&gt;enable &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WSL2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6&quot;&gt;install Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; as a virtual machine hosted by Windows. This Linux-on-Windows experience can be a smooth and safe first step into Linux territory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find several resources online for info on installing Python. e.g. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://realpython.com/installing-python/&quot;&gt;https://realpython.com/installing-python/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up and managing virtual environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing packages using PyPI (&lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;) and from Git repositories (e.g. GitHub)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick Python 101 - lists, dicts, if…else, loops, functions, error handling, import, help, numpy, matplotlib&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short neuroscience-themed project - modularizing the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good practices - lint (Flake8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

But I wanted to be fair and see what the authors did, since their results reflect an enormous amount of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here I will argue that a 10 minute brain scan cannot predict who you will choose at a speed dating event.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The resultant measures are even further away from identifying a compatible mate for you, since &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.768&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;only 5% of speed dating interactions result in a relationship&lt;/a&gt; of any sort (6% for sexual relationships and 4% for romantic relationships, according to one study).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was flabbergasted that anyone would think a “resting” state MRI scan (looking at “&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;” for 10 min) and its resulting pattern of correlated &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood-oxygen-level_dependent&quot; title=&quot;Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent&quot;&gt;BOLD&lt;/a&gt; signal fluctuations would reflect a level of superficial desirability that can be detected by a potential mate at greater than chance level. Another disclosure: this is far from my field of expertise. So I searched the literature. Apparently, “patterns of functional brain activity during rest encode latent similarities (e.g., in terms of how people think and behave) that are associated with friendship” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/117/52/33149.short&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hyon et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;). However, that study was conducted in a small town in South Korea (total population 860), allowing a detailed social network analysis. Plus, people knew each other well and experienced many of the same day to day events, which could shape their functional connectomes. Not exactly relevant for predicting strangers' speed dating choices, eh?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another paper identified a “global personality network” based on data from 984 participants in the Human Connectome Project (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918320342&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Liu et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;). The sample was large enough to support a training set of n=801 and a “hold-out” dataset (n=183) for validation purposes. The results supported the authors' “similar brain, similar personality” hypothesis. But in the dating world, how much do “similars” attract (compared to the popular saying, “opposites attract”)? Well why not construct (dis)similarity profiles between potential pairs by taking the absolute value of differences in functional connectivity (FC), and combine those with values of similarities in FC? Does that make sense?? And in order to arrive at this metric, there's a whole lot of machine learning (but with much smaller training sets)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Identity Classification&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate sample of 44 individuals from the Human Connectome Project was used to construct the Similarity of Connectivity Pattern between pairs&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhab143/6304412&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kajimura et al., 2021&lt;/a&gt;). These 44 participants had each been scanned twice, allowing 44 self-self pairs (Jessica at time 1 vs. Jessica at time 2), which were compared to 44 self-other pairs (Jessica at time 1 vs. Jennifer at time 2). Self-self “feature values” always show a positive correlation, and these were used to define “individual-specific information.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;26,680 feature values?&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;To start, 116 regions of interest (ROIs) were defined by Automated Anatomical Labeling (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11771995/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AAL&lt;/a&gt;). Pairwise comparisons of these for Self scan #1 vs. Self scan #2 (or vs. Other scan #2) resulted in a vector of 6,670 functional connectivities for each data point [(116 × 115)/2]. Then multiply this by four (!!) and you get 26,680 values fed into a machine learning classifier. Why four? Because the slow fluctuating BOLD signals were decomposed into four frequency bands for the classification procedure. Was this necessary? Does it add robustness, or merely more opportunities for false positive results?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;700&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1946&quot; height=&quot;144&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_WAyb61BcXA/YNrJumqza0I/AAAAAAAANWM/82YKNqdApJE8g5xlqHwP6FNw4VafTKiWgCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h144/Fig%2B3%2B-%2Btop%2B100%2Bfeature%2Bvalues.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig. 3 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhab143/6304412&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kajimura et al., 2021&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;. Top 100 feature values, i.e. absolute values of differences between functional connectivity that contributed to identity classification for three frequency bands [&lt;i&gt;the fourth was eliminated because the classifier could not distinguish between self-self and self-other pairs&lt;/i&gt;]. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The machine learning algorithm was sparse logistic regression with elastic-net regularization (SLR-EN), which usually prevents overfitting, but I don't know if the algorithm can overcome 26,680 feature values with only 44 subjects. Maybe I'm misunderstanding (and others can correct me if I'm wrong), but the number of participants is rather low for SLR-EN given the number of input parameters? Then...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The classification accuracy was evaluated using a stratified k-fold cross-validation procedure. ... The ratio of the number of correctly classified labels was then obtained as the classification accuracy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The regional results are below, showing a 7 x 7 brain network matrix with &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;similarity in red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (positive coefficients) and &lt;span style=&quot;color: #2b00fe;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;dissimilarity in blue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (negative coefficients). We're still in the realm of correctly classifying self-self, so &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #2b00fe;&quot;&gt;dissimilarites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; were considered artifacts of overfitting [&lt;i&gt;but similarities were not?&lt;/i&gt;]. If the contribution from similar &amp;gt; dissimilar with binomial tests, this was considered an indicator of self. This was true of F1 (53 out of 67, p&amp;lt;.001) and F2 (52 out of 67, p&amp;lt;.001), but not F3, which was at chance (33 out of 67).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1vVdLw6a20I/YNtaqJ7BrBI/AAAAAAAANWU/G3pWwILVzWw7mNYj5T2uMi-SpK2hxgdbACLcBGAsYHQ/s1018/similarity%2Bred%2Bdissimilarity%2Bblue.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;547&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1018&quot; height=&quot;215&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1vVdLw6a20I/YNtaqJ7BrBI/AAAAAAAANWU/G3pWwILVzWw7mNYj5T2uMi-SpK2hxgdbACLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h215/similarity%2Bred%2Bdissimilarity%2Bblue.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig. 4 (modified from &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhab143/6304412&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kajimura et al., 2021&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

The ML algorithm identified self for three of the frequency bands (F1-F3) at greater than chance levels (12.4%. 14.8%, and 16.3% better than chance, respectively). However, the algorithm is still wrong a lot of the time. This is especially important for the matchmaking study...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speed Dating &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors provided a nice self-explanatory graphic presenting an overview of the Speed Dating study (click on image for a larger view).

Why these numbers were not perfectly matched, I do not know. The resting state fMRI scan was several days before the first speed dating session. [I'm assuming it was the first, because the Methods say there were three speed dating events. There was also a post-dating scan, which was described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7336154/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;another paper&lt;/a&gt;]. The three hour event was held in a large room where pairs of participants had 3 min long conversations with every member of the opposite sex. After each conversation, all the men moved to the next table. When all the speed dates were over, each person was asked to identify at least half of the opposite sex individuals they'd like to chat with again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Well, there's a problem here — a requirement to select half the dates could result in less-than-optimal choices in some individuals. This requirement was necessary for sampling purposes, but it makes you wonder about the quality of the matches. Also, there was a strong possibility of unilateral matches — one individual thinks they've found their dream partner but that feeling was not reciprocated. When both members of a pair said &quot;yes&quot; they were considered compatible. Out of a total of 440 possible pairs, 158 were compatible and 282 incompatible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Compatible vs. Incompatible comparisons are the key findings of the study (Fig. 5, with A and B panels as above). Unlike the Identity comparison, compatible male-female pairs did not show more similar functional connnectivity patterns than incompatible pairs (Fig. 5A). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well then...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This indicates that the compatibility of female–male relationships is not necessarily represented by the similarity of functional connectivity patterns.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Unlike identity classification, compatibility classification was supported by the considerable negative coefficients of the features” (shown in Fig. 6 of the paper). We shall not interpret this as &lt;i&gt;opposites attract&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sSAxWCKama0/YNvNe-KwpsI/AAAAAAAANWs/gRAob2DqZ_oyR5eW_sFkwi2U9r52-39kQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1008/similarity%2Bof%2Bconnectivities_speed%2Bdating.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 0em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;374&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1008&quot; height=&quot;158&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sSAxWCKama0/YNvNe-KwpsI/AAAAAAAANWs/gRAob2DqZ_oyR5eW_sFkwi2U9r52-39kQCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h149/similarity%2Bof%2Bconnectivities_speed%2Bdating.jpg&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig. 5 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhab143/6304412&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kajimura et al., 2021&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Compatibility classification. &lt;b&gt;(A) &lt;/b&gt;Similarity of overall functional connectivity profile.

Vertical lines indicate chance levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fig. 5B shows classification accuracy for compatible pairs, which was above chance for F1 and F2. Before investing in a commercial venture,  however, you should know that the benefit beyond guessing is only 5.47% and 4.95%, respectively. Thus, I disagree with the claim that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;...the current results indicate that resting-state functional connectivity has information about behavioral tendencies that two individuals actually exhibit during a dyadic interaction, which cannot be measured by self-report methods and thus may remain hidden unless we use neuroimaging methods concurrently.&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To review the potential limitations of the study, we can't assess the quality of matches (meh vs. enthusiastic), we don't know what the participants were thinking about during their rsfMRI scan (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jneurosci.org/node/656115.full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gonzalez-Castillo et al., 2021&lt;/a&gt;), and we don't know their mental state during the scan. Although rs-FC fMRI is often considered a stable trait”, state factors and motion artifacts can affect the results on a given day (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604231/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Geerligs et al., 2015&lt;/a&gt;). Indeed, ~35% of the time, the present paper was unsuccessful in classifying the same person run on two different days (and that's excluding one of four frequencies that was not above chance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there something intrinsic encoded in BOLD signal fluctuations that can predict who we will find appealing (and a potential “match) after a three minute interaction?  Decisions at speed dating events are mostly based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.768&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;physical attractiveness&lt;/a&gt;, so it seems very implausible to me.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further Reading (the Speed Dating Collection)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-neuroscience-of-speed-dating-choice.html&quot;&gt;The Neuroscience of Speed Dating Choice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2012/09/the-electroencephalogram-cocktail-party.html&quot;&gt;The Electroencephalogram Cocktail Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2009/10/eeg-speed-dating.html&quot;&gt;EEG Speed Dating&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2008/07/journal-of-speed-dating-studies.html&quot;&gt;The Journal of Speed Dating Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner of Best Title &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9780824882822-013/html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;How I Meditated with Your Mother: Speed Dating at Temples and Shrines in Contemporary Japan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gs_citr&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Geerligs L, Rubinov M, Henson RN.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The oldest known strain of the plague-causing bacteria &lt;em&gt;Yersinia pestis &lt;/em&gt;has been found lurking in the bones and teeth of a man buried thousands of years ago in what is now Latvia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Genetic analysis suggests the &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt; strain that infected the man &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(21)00645-8&quot;&gt;emerged around 7,100 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report online June 29 in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;. It usurps the previous record-holder, found in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/5000-year-old-mass-grave-harbors-oldest-human-plague-case&quot;&gt;5,000-year-old Scandinavian mass grave&lt;/a&gt; associated with a possible plague epidemic &lt;em&gt; (SN: 12/6/18)&lt;/em&gt;. The Latvia man’s bones are also about 5,000 years old, but DNA comparison suggests he contracted a less virulent strain that emerged 1,000 years earlier in &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt; history than that found at the Scandinavian site. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bacterial DNA also suggest that the ancient plague victim didn’t develop pustules or infect his family. And the strain lacked the gene for swift flea-to-human transmission, which evolved perhaps 3,800 years ago and drove later bubonic plague epidemics, says Ben Krause-Kyora, an archaeologist and biochemist at Kiel University in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s likely this early plague strain passed to humans through isolated encounters, such as from rodent bites, Krause-Kyora and colleagues conclude. The man was carefully buried, and the team didn’t find mass graves or &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt; infection in other individuals’ DNA, suggesting&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;people in the area weren’t &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plague-bacteria-die-offs-ancient-siberians-genetics-dna&quot;&gt;facing an epidemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(SN: 1/6/21)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Without antibiotics, the man probably succumbed to his infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although this &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt; is the oldest strain ever found, it ultimately went extinct, being replaced by other, more virulent versions — a common fate in the evolutionary history of both bacteria and viruses. Later &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt; strains may have been more contagious, but isolated encounters like this one may help scientists understand the plague’s early history.  “Maybe it’s really single events in the beginning, then more and more severe, before it became really dramatic in medieval times,” Krause-Kyora says.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pacific-northwest-heat-wave-climate-change-things-to-know"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3100908</id>
		<updated>2021-06-29T19:13:47+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Like a lid on a steaming pot, a high-pressure system is sitting over the U.S. Pacific Northwest and British Columbia, Canada, sending temperatures in the region soaring to unprecedented heights.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From a historic perspective, the event is so rare and extreme as to be a once in a millennium heat wave. But one consequence of Earth’s rapidly changing climate is that such extreme events will become much more common in the region in future, says Larry O’Neill, a climate scientist at Oregon State University in Corvallis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Temperatures in Portland, Ore., reached 115° Fahrenheit (46° Celsius) on June 29, the highest temperature recorded there since record-keeping began in 1940; average high temperatures for this time of year are about 73° F (23° C). Similar records were notched across the region and more are expected to be set as the high pressure system slowly slides east.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The heat was so extreme it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PDXStreetcar/status/1409287314870837253&quot;&gt;melted transit power cables&lt;/a&gt; for Portland’s cable cars and caused asphalt and concrete roads in western Washington to expand and crack. Such high temperatures are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/are-we-ready-deadly-heat-waves-future&quot;&gt;particularly dangerous&lt;/a&gt; in a normally cool region little used to or prepared for it, raising the risk of heat-related deaths and other health hazards (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/3/18&lt;/em&gt;). Ground-level ozone levels, for instance, also reached the highest seen yet in 2021, the chemical reactions that form the gas amped up by a potent mix of high heat and strong ultraviolet light.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;O’Neill talked to &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt; about three things to know about the heat wave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;1. The heat wave is linked to a stalled kink in the jet stream.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jet streams, fast-moving currents of air high in the troposphere, encircle both poles, helping to push weather systems around Earth’s surface.  The current isn’t smooth and straight; it can meander and form large swirls, peaks and troughs surrounding zones of high- and low-pressure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, these weather patterns stall, becoming stationary “blocking events” that keep a particular spate of weather in place for an extended period of time. One such stalled-out high-pressure zone — basically a large dome of hot, dry weather — is now sitting atop the Pacific Northwest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed alignleft is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The punishing heatwave has an incredible jet stream pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dome of heat will be encircled by the polar jet and this helps lift a sub-tropical jet branch almost into the Canadian Arctic. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/uIWIIINlSc&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/uIWIIINlSc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Scott Duncan (@ScottDuncanWX) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ScottDuncanWX/status/1408444011128496128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;London-based meteorologist Scott Duncan tweets about the unusual heat (top) and the jet stream pattern (bottom) that created that heat dome over the Pacific Northwest. In the jet stream image, hot, dry air (in orange) swirls around and maintains a high-pressure system over the region from June 24 to June 29, locking that hot, dry air in place.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Historically, similar high-pressure patterns have brought heat waves to the region, O’Neill says. But this one is different. A typical severe heat wave in the past might lead to temperatures of about 100 °F, he says, “not 115 °F.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;2. Climate change is making the heat wave more severe.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Baseline temperatures were already higher than in the past, due to Earth’s changing climate. Globally, Earth’s average temperatures are increasing, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hottest-year-record-temperature-2020-2016-nasa-noaa&quot;&gt;2016 and 2020 tied for the hottest years on record&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/14/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those changes are reflected in what’s now officially considered “normal.” In May, for example, the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the country’s new baseline reference temperature, or “climate normal,” will be the period from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-weather-normals-30-years-hottest-record-united-states&quot;&gt;1991 to 2020 — also now the hottest 30-year period on record&lt;/a&gt; for the country (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/26/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That changing reference makes it tough to place such an unprecedented heat wave in any kind of historical context. “We have a historical data record that’s 100 years long,” O’Neill says. Saying that the heat wave is a once-in-a-millennium event means that “you would expect that, at random chance, this would occur once every 1,000 years. But we’ve never observed this. We have no basis to say this,” he adds. “This is a climate that we’re not accustomed to.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;3. Climate change is likely to make such extreme events more common in the future.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A week before the onset of the heat wave, forecasters were predicting such unprecedented temperatures for the region that many people dismissed those predictions as “being ridiculous,” O’Neill says. “Turns out, [the forecasters] were right.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-siberia-heat-wave-more-likely-global-warming-arctic&quot;&gt;climate change attribution studies&lt;/a&gt; may shed some more light on the ways in which this particular heat wave may be linked to climate change (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/15/20&lt;/em&gt;). Overall, it’s known that climate change is likely to make such extreme events more common in the future, O’Neill says. “We’re seeing these highs form more frequently, and more persistently.” Extreme heat and extreme drought in the U.S. West, for example, can create a reinforcing cycle &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-made-southwestern-u-s-drought-worst-1200-years&quot;&gt;that exacerbates both&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/16/20&lt;/em&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that poses many dangers for the planet, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/are-we-ready-deadly-heat-waves-future&quot;&gt;not least for human health&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/3/18&lt;/em&gt;). In May, scientists reported in &lt;em&gt;Nature Climate Change&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01058-x&quot;&gt;37 percent of heat-related deaths&lt;/a&gt; between 1991 and 2018 were attributable to human-caused climate change.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we talk about climate change, often the conversation is a little more abstract,” O’Neill says. “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-americans-now-see-signs-climate-change-where-they-live&quot;&gt;We’re experiencing it right now&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/25/19&lt;/em&gt;). And this question about whether we adapt and mitigate — that’s something we have to figure out right now.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research has shown many benefits to extraversion. One &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fapl0000415&quot;&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; on personality traits in the workplace found that extraverts are more motivated, experience more positive emotions, work harder and have fewer adverse experiences at work, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopy.12387&quot;&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; found that extraversion was associated with more creative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re not naturally extraverted, however, these wellbeing benefits are not necessarily out of reach. One &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/24/first-trial-of-an-act-like-an-extravert-intervention-finds-that-it-comes-with-drawbacks-for-introverts/&quot;&gt;intervention&lt;/a&gt; suggested that acting like an extravert could bring the benefits of natural extraversion, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/08/29/further-evidence-that-acting-like-an-extravert-can-boost-wellbeing/&quot;&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; generated similar findings a year later. However, some of this work also suggests that for people who are particularly introverted, acting like an extravert could be exhausting and actually produce &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; emotions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211015062#_i41&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, looks in more detail at what happens when we deviate from our “baseline” levels of extraversion. The team finds that higher-than-normal levels of extraversion-related behaviours are associated with more positive feelings — even for those who aren’t extraverted to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42734&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the start of the first study, 92 participants completed a measure of trait extraversion (i.e. baseline levels of extraversion). Over the next four weeks, they then completed survey questions five times a day related to state extraversion (i.e. in-the-moment extraversion-related feelings and behaviours such as being talkative or energetic) and positive feelings, which was measured with a single question, “How are you feeling right now?”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results showed that during weeks in which participants had behaved in a more introverted way than they usually do — i.e. when their state extraversion that week was lower than the average state extraversion across the entire time period —they experienced lower levels of positive feeling. But when they behaved more &lt;em&gt;extraverted&lt;/em&gt; than usual, even when their average level of extraversion was not high, they had higher levels of positive feeling. This suggests that behaving in an extraverted way may increase feelings of wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second study replicated the first — only this time, positive affect was explored in more depth: participants indicated how much they agreed with numerous statements about how they felt in the moment (for example, “at this moment, I feel inspired”) rather than simply answering one question. (This study also took place over a shorter time period, with the researchers comparing responses during two three-day periods rather than across several weeks). Again, participants reported lower levels of positive affect during periods in which they had behaved in a more introverted fashion, while in more extroverted periods they experienced higher levels — although these effects were only trends which did not reach statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In these studies, behaving in a more extraverted manner than normal did not seem to have negative impacts, even for the more introverted participants, in the longer term. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/24/first-trial-of-an-act-like-an-extravert-intervention-finds-that-it-comes-with-drawbacks-for-introverts/&quot;&gt;other work &lt;/a&gt;has found less clear-cut benefits: even if introverts experienced momentary gains in positive affect these didn’t last, and there were other troublesome impacts including fatigue and negative emotion. This may be because those previous studies had participants “act like an extravert” or behave in a way that felt unnatural to them, while in the new work the researchers simply looked at the changes in people’s behaviour on a day-to-day basis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the team acknowledges, the study can’t determine the direction of causality between extraversion and positive feelings. Rather than extraverted behaviour increasing positive feelings, could it be that positive affect induces more extraverted behaviour? Future work could look more closely at the direction of this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the results have made you want to boost your &lt;em&gt;trait &lt;/em&gt;extraversion, it may not be so simple  —  changing your personality altogether appears to be a bit more tricky than just behaving in an extraverted way a few times a week. If you succeed in tasks designed to make you behave consistently with a particular trait, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/01/merely-desiring-to-alter-your-personality-is-not-enough-and-may-backfire-unless-you-take-concrete-action-to-change/&quot;&gt;one study found&lt;/a&gt;, change can indeed occur. But trying and failing  —  which may well happen to introverts attempting to become more extraverted  —  can have the opposite effect, making people even less likely to embody certain traits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211015062&quot;&gt;Do You Feel Better When You Behave More Extraverted Than You Are? The Relationship Between Cumulative Counterdispositional Extraversion and Positive Feelings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Caught in a fatal inward spiral, a neutron star met its end when a black hole swallowed it whole. Gravitational ripples from that collision spread outward through the cosmos, eventually reaching Earth. The detection of those waves marks the first reported sighting of a black hole engulfing the dense remnant of dead star. And in a surprise twist, scientists spotted a second such merger just days after the first.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Until now, all identified sources of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo&quot;&gt;gravitational waves&lt;/a&gt; were twos of a kind: either two black holes or two neutron stars, spiraling around one another before colliding and coalescing (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/21/21&lt;/em&gt;). The violent cosmic collisions create waves that stretch and squeeze the fabric of spacetime, undulations that can be sussed out by sensitive detectors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mismatched pairing of a black hole and neutron star was the final type of merger that scientists expected to find with current gravitational wave observatories. By pure coincidence, researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/ac082e&quot;&gt;spotted two of these events&lt;/a&gt; within 10 days of one another, the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA collaborations report in the July 1 &lt;em&gt;Astrophysical Journal Letters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not only have unions between black holes and neutron stars not been seen before via gravitational waves, the smashups have also never been spotted at all by any other means.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“This is an absolute first look,” says theoretical physicist Susan Scott of the Australian National University in Canberra, a member of the LIGO collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result adds another tick mark to the tally of new discoveries made with gravitational waves. “That’s worth celebration,” says astrophysicist Cole Miller of the University of Maryland in College Park, who was not involved with the research. Since the first gravitational waves were detected in 2015, the observatories keep revealing new secrets. “It’s fantastic new things; it’s not just the same old, same old,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Signs of the black hole-neutron star collisions registered in the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave observatories in 2020, on January 5 and January 15. The first merger consisted of a black hole about 8.9 times the mass of the sun and a neutron star about 1.9 times the sun’s mass. The second merger had a 5.7 solar mass black hole and a 1.5 solar mass neutron star. Both collisions occurred more than 900 million light-years from Earth, the scientists estimate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To form detectable gravitational waves, the objects that coalesce must be extremely dense, with identities that can be pinned down by their masses. Anything with a mass above five solar masses could only be a black hole, scientists think. Anything less than about three solar masses must be a neutron star.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One earlier gravitational wave detection involved a black hole merging with an object that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ligo-virgo-detected-collision-black-hole-mystery-object&quot;&gt;couldn’t be identified&lt;/a&gt;, as its mass seemed to fall in between the cutoffs that separate black holes and neutron stars (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/23/20&lt;/em&gt;). Another previous merger may have resulted from a black hole melding with a neutron star, but the signal from that event wasn’t strong enough for scientists to be certain that the detection was the real deal. The two new detections clinch the case for black hole and neutron star meetups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the new events is more convincing than the other. The Jan. 5 merger was seen in just one of LIGO’s two gravitational wave detectors, and the signal has a relatively high probability of being a false alarm, Miller says. “If this were the only event, then you would not be as confident.” The Jan. 15 event, however, “seems pretty solid,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Epic rendezvous between neutron stars and black holes happen regularly throughout the cosmos, the detections suggest. Based on the pace of detections, the researchers estimate that these events take place about once a month within 1 billion light-years of Earth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;In a newly reported class of cosmic smashup, a neutron star (apparent in orange in this computer simulation, after the video zooms in) and black hole (dark gray) spiral inward, producing gravitational waves (blue) in a dance that ends when the black hole swallows the neutron star.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists don’t yet know how neutron stars and black holes come to meet up. They might form together, as two stars that orbit one another until both run out of fuel and die, with one collapsing into a black hole and the other forming a neutron star. Or the two objects might have formed separately and met up in a crowded region packed with many neutron stars and black holes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a black hole and neutron star spiral inward and merge, scientists expect that the black hole could rip the neutron star to shreds, producing a light show that could be observed with telescopes. But astronomers found no fireworks in the aftermath of the two newly reported encounters, nor any evidence that the black holes deformed the neutron stars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That could be because in both cases the black hole was significantly larger than the neutron star, suggesting that the black hole gulped down the neutron star whole in a meal worthy of Pac-Man, Scott says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If scientists could spot a black hole shredding a neutron star in the future, that could help researchers pin down the properties of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-stars-pulsar-density-diameter-matter&quot;&gt;ultradense, neutron-rich material&lt;/a&gt; that makes up the dead stars (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/20/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In past detections of gravitational waves, the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, based in the United States, has teamed up with Virgo, in Italy. The new observations are the first to include members of a third observatory, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-gravitational-wave-detector-kagra-almost-ready-join-search&quot;&gt;KAGRA, in Japan&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/18/19&lt;/em&gt;). But the KAGRA detector itself didn’t contribute to the results, as scientists were still preparing it to detect gravitational waves at the time. LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA are all currently offline while scientists tinker with the detectors, and will resume their communal search for cosmic collisions in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccine-development-speed"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3100808</id>
		<updated>2021-06-29T10:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Six months after the first COVID-19 shots started going into arms in the United States, the pace of vaccination has slowed. That’s prompted White House officials to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/06/22/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-42/&quot;&gt;scale back their goal&lt;/a&gt; of getting at least one dose to 70 percent of all U.S. adults by July 4; they’re now aiming for 70 percent of those 27 and older.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even so, more than 1 in 5 Americans say they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychiatry.org/newsroom/apa-public-opinion-poll-2021-annual-meeting&quot;&gt;won’t get vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, according to a recent poll by the American Psychiatric Association. Among the reasons that often pop up are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7006e3.htm#T3_down&quot;&gt;worries that the vaccines were developed too fast&lt;/a&gt;: Normally, drug research takes years or even decades from idea to reality. The first vaccines to combat COVID-19 were developed, tested and given emergency use authorization in 11 months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Driven by a global urgency and underpinned by decades of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-coronavirus-vaccine-development-process-accelerating&quot;&gt;prior work on vaccine technology&lt;/a&gt;, vaccine developers found a way to chop not just days or months, but years off the timeline (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/21/20&lt;/em&gt;). What was jettisoned was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trials-speed-safety&quot;&gt;not the science, or the safety tests&lt;/a&gt;, but rather the wait time baked into the development process — waiting for results and waiting for regulatory approvals (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/10/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;By comparing the new vaccines with earlier drugs that have used the same tech under more traditional research timelines, it is possible to calculate approximately how much time got chopped off the development process once shots were ready to go into arms: roughly four years. Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Unlocking the coronavirus’ secrets&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To back up a bit first, designing the vaccines began far earlier than the jabs-in-arms stage. It began with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-pandemic-timeline-events&quot;&gt;deciphering the exact genetic makeup&lt;/a&gt; of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/11/20&lt;/em&gt;). By early January 2020, that genetic blueprint was in hand and the first vaccines to test were ready just a few weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;illustration of a spike protein on the surface of a virus&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100813&quot; height=&quot;510&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/051221_rl_covidvaxtimline_inline1_spike.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100813&quot;&gt;A coronavirus spike protein (red) binds to an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (blue) on a human cell in this illustration. The virus uses the ACE2 receptor to break into human cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100813&quot;&gt;JUAN GAERTNER/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/GETTY IMAGES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For some perspective, researchers first deciphered, or sequenced, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-work-reaches-milestone&quot;&gt;entire human genome&lt;/a&gt; over a span of almost 13 years, starting in 1990 and wrapping up in 2003 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/17/03&lt;/em&gt;). Because of advances in computers, the same task now can take only hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most crucially, researchers now had the genetic instructions for making the spike proteins that the virus uses to break into cells — a key ingredient for making the vaccines. Jutting out from the virus’ surface, these spike proteins make an easy target for the immune system to recognize. Researchers knew to zero in on those proteins thanks to decades of work studying coronaviruses, including two that have caused other outbreaks of human diseases — SARS and MERS. That work also identified the best form of the protein to use: a stable form just before the virus fuses with a cell it’s about to infect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Finding a delivery system&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those instructions could then be fed directly into pre-made delivery vehicles that carry the genetic code to cells to induce an immune response. Scientists had already built these rapid, genetically based templates largely because of the ongoing battle against HIV, says Tom Denny, Chief Operating Officer of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute in Durham, N.C.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the last 10 to 15 years, there’ve been major teams around the world … trying to understand what needed to occur to make a protective HIV vaccine,” Denny says. Those efforts have “helped us in our battle with this current pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These vehicles are like the Potato Head toys of the vaccine development world: Instead of swapping in different facial features, information specific to each virus gets plugged in. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Denny calls it “plug-and-play” vaccine manufacturing. Decades of trying to attack HIV has created a library of safe weapons to use quickly against any new would-be viral marauders. “We got lucky,” Denny says, that the developed platforms have worked so well for this new deadly virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the templates directly carries a nonfunctional, partial strand of viral mRNA to cells in the body, delivering instructions for those cells to create copies of the protein that the immune system recognizes as foreign. That’s what’s used in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mRNA for the coronavirus’ spike proteins gets packaged inside tiny bubbles of fat called lipid nanoparticles. These tiny fat bubbles have been around for decades and safely used for dozens of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6764803/&quot;&gt;other drugs&lt;/a&gt;, some approved, others still in the pipeline. So all that needed to be changed to target SARS-CoV-2 were the directions nestled inside.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The contents of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-vaccines-cold-freeze-pfizer-moderna&quot;&gt;fat bubbles&lt;/a&gt; are known as their “payload,” says Vicki Stronge (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/20/20&lt;/em&gt;). She’s the director of product management at Precision NanoSystems in Vancouver, which manufactures equipment and compounds for the development of lipid nanoparticles. She explains why those fat bubbles are so crucial: If the mRNA is injected alone outside a bubble, it breaks down quickly, degrading into harmless biological raw bits and pieces that get recycled by our bodies.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Benefiting from past research&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two key therapies — one still in the works and one approved — paved the way for COVID-19 vaccine developers to hit the ground running with RNA-based templates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One therapy, made by Germany-based CureVac, is the first vaccine to reach human trials that was developed using mRNA to fight an infectious disease. It targets the rabies virus and was injected into human volunteers starting in 2013. Decades earlier, in 1971, researchers developed the first syringefuls that they thought were safe for humans, which they initially tested by injecting themselves. The first version of the mRNA-based rabies vaccine prompted only a weak immune system response but did show that the technology was safe. A newer version of this rabies vaccine is starting to show promising results in clinical trials. (CureVac is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/05/health/covid-vaccine-curevac.html&quot;&gt;developing an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, although &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.curevac.com/en/2021/06/16/curevac-provides-update-on-phase-2b-3-trial-of-first-generation-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-cvncov/&quot;&gt;early results&lt;/a&gt; have been disappointing.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100811&quot; height=&quot;382&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/051221_rl_covidvaxtimline_inline2_rabies.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100811&quot;&gt;The rabies virus, illustrated here, was the first targeted by an mRNA-based vaccine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100811&quot;&gt;NANOCLUSTERING/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/GETTY IMAGES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other therapy is patisiran, an RNA-based drug for a rare but often fatal heredity disease in which amyloid proteins build up in nerves and some organs. It uses the same design based on lipid nanoparticles as the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, just with a different payload inside.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Years of data from monitoring patients who had been injected with these RNA fragments wrapped in lipid nanoparticles shows they’re safe, says Sascha Tuchman, a hematologist-oncologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who oversaw a site for the Phase III patisiran trials. Patients who receive a dose of patisiran have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30489166/&quot;&gt;lower risk&lt;/a&gt; of side effects than those who got injections with placebo saline. And when it comes to long-term negative consequences from RNA and lipid nanoparticles, Tuchman says, “we haven’t seen anything additional in terms of the safety that would indicate that there is some reason to be concerned.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Six years after the first shots began being tested, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-its-kind-targeted-rna-based-therapy-treat-rare-disease&quot;&gt;FDA approved patisiran&lt;/a&gt;, a little faster than standard pace for new treatments. That makes it a good comparison to show where the COVID-19 vaccines were able to cut time, not counting the decades of research of development that got us to this point. So let’s start the clock.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Recruiting volunteers&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the first syringefuls of prospective COVID-19 vaccine emerged from the “plug-and-play” mRNA labs, years were removed from the timeline by cutting out the long stretches of pure waiting that are built into most human testing. Driven by the urgency of the pandemic, nearly half a million people in America alone had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/covid-19-vaccine-trials-1-million-more-volunteers-still-needed&quot;&gt;offered up their deltoids&lt;/a&gt; for the cause through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/&quot;&gt;COVID-19 Prevention Network&lt;/a&gt; in a matter of months, in many cases even before the first public inklings of success, according to the American Medical Association.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, it took just under 16 weeks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577#article&quot;&gt;recruit and enroll more than 43,000 volunteers&lt;/a&gt; for the final phases of testing Pfizer’s vaccine. When volunteer recruitment began for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)31665-3/fulltext&quot;&gt;clinical trials of the rabies mRNA vaccine&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, it took 813 days to get 101 participants enrolled. Based on this comparison, that’s roughly 730 days — nearly two years — saved in recruiting alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100812&quot; height=&quot;453&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/051221_rl_covidvaxtimline_inline3_manufacture.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100812&quot;&gt;Late last year, Pfizer and Moderna were already manufacturing vaccine doses in anticipation of authorization. Here, workers prepare to ship doses out of Pfizer’s Kalamazoo, Mich., plant just two days after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization for that vaccine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100812&quot;&gt;Morry Gash/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Getting fast results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another, more dismal factor contributed to the scientific speed: How fast the virus spread. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists can begin to calculate a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-what-does-covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-mean&quot;&gt;vaccine’s efficacy&lt;/a&gt; when a sufficient number of people in the group that got a placebo rather than a vaccine have gotten infected naturally (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/4/20&lt;/em&gt;). If an outbreak peters out, it takes longer to reach that threshold. That’s true too if a virus naturally spreads more slowly — say a virus like HIV, herpes or human papillomavirus, or HPV, which are transmitted primarily through sex. In contrast, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-breathing-talking-enough-spread-airborne&quot;&gt;just breathing or talking can spread SARS-CoV-2&lt;/a&gt; — and everybody does that (&lt;em&gt;SN&lt;/em&gt;: 4/2/20). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Loosely comparing vaccine trials for COVID-19 with HPV vaccine trials offer clues to just how many days may have been lopped off the COVID-19 timeline because of the new virus’s astronomical rate of spread. The HPV trials took about 529 days, or 1.4 years, to reach a point at which efficacy could be calculated, when the placebo group got to an infection rate of 3.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer Phase II/III coronavirus trial, in contrast, got initial efficacy results for the first of its two doses in just 105 days, when it hit a nearly 2.4 percent infection rate in the placebo group. That’s 424 days faster than HPV. Why? Because just months into the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 was infecting hundreds of thousands of people per day globally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Jumping the line&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was also waiting time recouped from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s review process. Typically, it takes the FDA 10 months to review a new drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, with the COVID-19 death toll rising, the FDA rushed all coronavirus vaccines to the front of the review lines. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-authorize-pfizer-vaccine-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic&quot;&gt;Pfizer vaccine&lt;/a&gt; got reviewed and authorized for emergency use only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download&quot;&gt;21 days&lt;/a&gt; after submission and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-fda-approval&quot;&gt;Moderna vaccine&lt;/a&gt; in just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download&quot;&gt;19 days&lt;/a&gt; (SN:&lt;em&gt; 12/11/20; SN: 12/18/20&lt;/em&gt;). Compared with a more typical 10-month wait time, that’s about another 283 days saved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In total, that’s 1,437 days, or 3.9 years, cut off the normal timeline for a new vaccine. And that doesn’t include other time savings, such as putting the ethics reviews at the front of the line. Add that saved time to the 11 months it actually took to get the first COVID-19 vaccines and it would add up to nearly five years — remarkably close to the six years needed to test and approve patisiran.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a final jolt of speed, some pharmaceutical companies, bolstered by big vaccine contracts and research cash from the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed, were also churning out doses during clinical trials in the hopes that the vaccines would work. Once the companies had emergency use authorization in hand, they were ready to ship doses immediately.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Decades of previous work combined with a fast-moving virus, a public willingness to help and elimination of wait times drove the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines. No safety steps were skipped, says Stanley Plotkin, emeritus professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania, who is perhaps best known for his work developing the rubella vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rapid creation of the COVID-19 vaccines, Plotkin says, are “a sea change in how to develop vaccines.” They are an example of what scientists can do when unfettered from waiting.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Being quite small, insects can have a very different relationship with the water-air interface than larger animals do. Surface tension allows for insects like water striders to skate along the top of still waters, for example. But new research reveals an unusual way to tread along this boundary: from the underside. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A water-dwelling beetle can &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eth.13203&quot;&gt;scuttle upside-down along the underside of the water’s surface&lt;/a&gt;, as if the water were a solid pane of glass, researchers report June 28 in &lt;em&gt;Ethology&lt;/em&gt;. It’s the first detailed documentation of a beetle moving in this manner, which is known only in precious few animal groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;John Gould, a behavioral biologist at the University of Newcastle in Callaghan, Australia, hadn’t set out to look for beetles one night in the country’s Watagan Mountains, searching instead for tadpoles in ephemeral pools. In one of these pools, he spotted a black object smaller than a pinky nail.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At first, I just assumed it must have been a bug that had fallen into the water and was swimming across the surface,” Gould recounts, “but then realized the bug was upside-down and below the water’s surface.”  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;As Gould quickly filmed the scene, the beetle — later identified as a water scavenger beetle (Hydrophilidae) — walked under the water’s surface just as it would on a flat, solid surface, periodically resting and changing direction. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;code&gt;An aquatic beetle walks along the underside of the water’s surface in the Watagan Mountains in New South Wales, Australia. The thin bubble visible along the insect’s belly may help pin it to the surface and provide a source of oxygen.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Later, Gould mentioned the encounter to his colleague Jose Valdez, a wildlife ecologist at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig. Valdez thought the observations were interesting, but he’d seen insects walk upright under water before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t fully grasp what he was describing until he showed me the video,” says Valdez. “Then I was floored.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Searching the scientific literature, the researchers found that some snails could slide along the underside of the water’s surface on a layer of mucus, but little documentation of beetles walking this way existed — just passing mentions in decades-old papers.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a publication gap that surprised Martin Fikáček, an entomologist at National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The under-surface walking ability is known to aquatic beetle specialists, who exploit the behavior when collecting the beetles. Researchers will unsettle the pond bottom and the beetles float to the surface, where they skitter around upside-down, he explains. But no one had looked closely at the phenomenon. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s actually cool that somebody started to think about [the beetles’ abilities], because we always see it and we never even thought about it,” says Fikáček, who was not involved with this research.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;What’s still unclear is how the insect physically manages this feat, but the researchers have an idea. Gould’s recording of the beetle showed an air bubble trapped along the creature’s upturned belly. The team thinks the bubble’s buoyancy may be flipping and pinning the beetle to the underside of the water’s surface. That allows the insect to put pressure on the water-air boundary with every step, creating what Gould observed as tiny hills of water sprouting from the beetle’s feet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It would have been really interesting to know which parts of the animals are [water-repellant] and which are not, as well as information on feet anatomy,” says Tom Weihmann, a movement physiologist at the University of Cologne in Germany not involved with this study. The beetle might be pushing off against the water like the researchers describe, he says, but this would mean the beetle’s feet are attracted to water, contrasting with a water-repellant body.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gould and Valdez think the beetle might use this water-walking superpower to stay far away from ambush predators that lurk along the bottom of these pools. But this must be sussed out with additional research. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future research might reveal if the beetles can switch to the opposite side of the water-air interface and leave the water entirely. Additional studies on the physics of the beetle’s upside-down water-walking prowess could also inspire advancements in robotics, as has been accomplished &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/robot-springs-water&quot;&gt;with water striders&lt;/a&gt;, the team notes (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/30/15&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight how often we ignore or miss the amazing things the smallest animals are doing every day, Gould says. “Describing the natural history of the small is just as important as describing the natural history of any large mammal or bird.” &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Do you listen to quiet music to help you wind down before sleep? If you do, you’re following the advice of all kinds of organisations, including the US National Institutes of Health and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene/bedtime-routine-for-adults&quot;&gt;National Sleep Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. However, this advice could be counter-productive, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797621989724&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; by Michael K. Scullin and colleagues at Baylor University. The work, published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, found that bedtime music was associated with more sleep disruptions —  and that instrumental music is even worse than music with lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42716&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 199 online participants living in the US reported on their sleep quality and music listening frequency and timing, as well as their beliefs about how this affected their sleep. Almost all — 87% — believed that music improves sleep, or at least does not disrupt it. However, the team found that more overall time spent listening to music was associated with poorer sleep and daytime sleepiness. Just over three quarters of the participants also reported experiencing frequent “earworms” — having a song or tune “stuck” and replaying in their minds. A quarter reported experiencing these during the night at least once per week, and these people were (unsurprisingly) six times as likely to report poor sleep quality. The team’s analysis suggested that listening specifically to instrumental music near bedtime was linked to more sleep-related earworms and poorer sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team then ran an experimental study on 48 young adults. After arriving at the sleep lab at 8.45pm, participants went to a quiet, dimly lit bedroom, where they completed a host of questionnaires that included measures of stress, sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. They also had electrodes applied, ready for the night-time polysomnography (which recorded their brain wave activity, as well as heart rate and breathing), and reported on how relaxed, nervous, energetic, sleepy and stressed they felt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At 10pm, they were given some “downtime”, with quiet music playing. Half were randomised to hear three songs: “Don’t Stop Believin’’’ by Journey, “Call Me Maybe” by Carly Rae Jepsen and “Shake It Off” by Taylor Swift, while the other half heard instrumental-only versions of these same songs. (The team chose these songs because they are known to cause earworms and were likely to be very familiar to the participants.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants reported decreases in stress and nervousness and increased relaxation after listening to either set of songs, and also showed decreases in blood pressure. So — as earlier studies have also suggested — quiet music at bedtime was indeed relaxing at the time. However, a quarter of the participants woke from sleep with an earworm, and the polysomnography data showed that instrumental versions of the songs were more likely to trigger these awakenings as well as to cause other sleep disruptions, such as shifts from deeper sleep to lighter sleep. Taken together, the findings represent “causal evidence for bedtime instrumental music affecting sleep quality via inducing earworms,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The EEG data showed that the participants who woke up with an earworm had significantly greater “frontal slow oscillations” — a classic signature of memory consolidation during sleep. Earworm-associated slow oscillations were also seen in the auditory cortex, which processes sounds. Earworm awakenings seem, then, to result from the reactivation of melodies heard during the day during sleep, as part of the memory consolidation process. The team’s overall data suggests that this is more likely to happen when the melodies are heard around bedtime, and are instrumental.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why instrumental-only songs should have a bigger impact than music with lyrics isn’t clear. The three songs used in this study were chosen because they were likely to be familiar. Hearing them without the lyrics might have prompted the participant’s brains to try to add the words, which might have made earworms more likely. If this is the case, all instrumental music may not have the same effect. However, the data from the first study is consistent with the idea that instrumental music generally is more of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This work has practical implications, of course. “Just because music listening is enjoyable does not mean that more music is always better for health outcomes,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And for anyone who finds themselves struggling with earworms at night, the researchers have a few recommendations: limit how much music you listen to during the day, and avoid listening to music before bed. Instead, perhaps spend 5-10 minutes writing out a to-do list for the next day, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5758411/&quot;&gt;earlier work involving Scullin&lt;/a&gt; has found that this helps people to get to sleep. If you do struggle with sleep, you might also want to look into &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/10/digital-therapy-for-insomnia-shows-how-technology-can-be-harnessed-to-improve-sleep-and-mental-health/&quot;&gt;digital interventions&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/01/rock-a-bye-adult-study-shows-grown-ups-enjoy-better-sleep-and-memory-consolidation-in-a-rocking-bed/&quot;&gt;a rocking bed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780525656098&quot;&gt;Finding the Mother Tree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suzanne Simard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knopf, $28.95&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Opening Suzanne Simard’s new book, &lt;em&gt;Finding the Mother Tree&lt;/em&gt;, I expected to learn about the old growth forests of the Pacific Northwest. I had an inkling that Simard, a forest ecologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, would walk through her painstaking research to convince logging companies and others that clear-cutting large parcels of land is too damaging for forests to recover. I didn’t expect to be carried along on her very relatable journey through life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simard was born in the Monashee Mountains of British Columbia in 1960. Her family of loggers selectively cut trees and dragged them out with horses, leaving plenty still standing. In her first stab at a career, she joined a commercial logging company that clear-cut with large machinery. Her job was to check on seedlings the firm had planted in those areas to restart the forest. The fledgling plants were often yellowed and failing. Simard’s instincts told her those trees were missing the resources that exist within a diverse community of plants, so she set out to see if her hunch was right.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;She learned how to do experiments, with close calls with grizzly bears and other mishaps along the way, eventually becoming a tenured professor. She and colleagues discovered that underground networks of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/communism-trees-goes-underground&quot;&gt;fungi among tree roots shuttle carbon and nutrients&lt;/a&gt; from tree to tree (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/9/97, p. 87&lt;/em&gt;). Simard seamlessly weaves details of her studies of these networks with her life’s travails: sibling relationships and loss, struggles as a woman in a male-dominated field and her own recovery from a health crisis. Like many women who work outside the home, she felt torn between being with her young daughters and pursuing her professional passions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Readers will feel for Simard as much as they worry for the forests that are quickly disappearing. Simard presents plenty of evidence and writes enthusiastically to build her analogy of the “mother trees” — the biggest, oldest trees in a forest that nurture those nearby. In her experiments, seedlings planted near a mother tree were much more likely to survive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Trees and plants have agency,” she writes. “They cooperate, make decisions, learn and remember — qualities we normally ascribe to sentience, wisdom, intelligence.” Simard encourages logging companies to save the mother trees when harvesting to maintain the networks of information — the internet of the forest. Industry change has been slow, but she’s optimistic: “Sometimes when it seems nothing will budge, there’s a shift.”&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Scientists could be a step closer to understanding how some birds might exploit quantum physics to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers suspect that some songbirds use a “quantum compass” that senses the Earth’s magnetic field, helping them tell north from south during their annual migrations (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/3/18&lt;/em&gt;). New measurements support the idea that a protein in birds’ eyes called cryptochrome 4, or CRY4, could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-get-their-internal-compass-newly-id-eye-protein&quot;&gt;serve as a magnetic sensor&lt;/a&gt;. That protein’s magnetic sensitivity is thought to rely on&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-fragility-may-help-birds-navigate&quot;&gt; quantum mechanics&lt;/a&gt;, the math that describes physical processes on the scale of atoms and electrons (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/27/16&lt;/em&gt;). If the idea is shown to be correct, it would be a step forward for biophysicists who want to understand how and when quantum principles can become important in various biological processes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In laboratory experiments, the type of CRY4 in retinas of European robins (&lt;em&gt;Erithacus rubecula&lt;/em&gt;) responded to magnetic fields, researchers report in the June 24 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. That’s a crucial property for it to serve as a compass. “This is the first paper that actually shows that birds’ cryptochrome 4 is magnetically sensitive,” says sensory biologist Rachel Muheim of Lund University in Sweden, who was not involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists think that the magnetic sensing abilities of CRY4 are initiated when blue light hits the protein. That light sets off a series of reactions that shuttle around an electron, resulting in two unpaired electrons in different parts of the protein. Those lone electrons behave like tiny magnets, thanks to a quantum property of the electrons called spin.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The two electrons’ magnets can point either parallel to one another or in opposite directions. But quantum physics dictates that the electrons do not settle on either arrangement. Rather they exist in a limbo called a quantum superposition, which describes only the probability of finding the electrons in either configuration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Magnetic fields change those probabilities. That, in turn, affects how likely the protein is to form an altered version instead of returning to its original state. Birds may be able to determine their orientation in a magnetic field based on how much of the altered protein is produced, although that process is not yet understood. “How does the bird perceive this? We don’t know,” says chemist Peter Hore of the University of Oxford, a coauthor of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that cryptochromes play a role in birds’ internal compasses has been around for decades, but “no one could confirm this experimentally,” says Jingjing Xu of the University of Oldenburg in Germany. So in the new study, Xu, Hore and colleagues observed what happened when the isolated proteins were hit with blue laser light. After the laser pulse, the researchers measured how much light the sample absorbed. For robin CRY4, the addition of a magnetic field changed the amount of absorbance, a sign that the magnetic field was affecting how much of the altered form of the protein was produced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the researchers performed the same test on CRY4 found in nonmigratory chickens and pigeons, the magnetic field had little effect. The stronger response to the magnetic field in CRY4 from a migratory bird “could suggest that maybe there is really something special about the cryptochromes of migratory birds that use this for a compass,” says biophysicist Thorsten Ritz of the University of California, Irvine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But laboratory tests with chickens and pigeons have shown that those birds can sense magnetic fields, Ritz and Muheim both note. It’s not clear whether the higher sensitivity of robin CRY4 in laboratory tests is a result of evolutionary pressure for migratory birds to have a better magnetic sensor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One factor making interpretation of the results more difficult is that experiments on isolated proteins don’t match the conditions in birds’ eyes. For example, Xu says, scientists think the proteins may be aligned in one direction within the retina. To further illuminate the process, the researchers hope to perform future studies on actual retinas, to get a literal bird’s-eye view.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;As people age, so do all of our cells, which accumulate damage over time. But why our offspring don’t inherit those changes — effectively aging a child even before birth — has been a mystery. “When you are born, you don’t inherit your parents’ age,” says Yukiko Yamashita, a developmental biologist at MIT who studies the immortality of germline cells such as eggs or sperm. “For some reason, you are at zero.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts once thought that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scrambled-dogma-stem-cells-may-make-new-eggs-women&quot;&gt;germline cells&lt;/a&gt; might be ageless — somehow protected from the passage of time (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/10/04&lt;/em&gt;). But studies have shown signs of aging in eggs and sperm, dispelling that idea. So researchers have hypothesized that germline cells might instead reset their age after conception, reversing any damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a new study, scientists describe evidence that supports that rejuvenation hypothesis. Both mouse and human germline cells appear to reset their biological age in the early stages of an embryo’s development. A rejuvenation period that takes place after an embryo has attached to the uterus &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abg6082&quot;&gt;sets the growing embryo at its youngest biological age, dubbed “ground zero,”&lt;/a&gt; researchers report June 25 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding how germline cells reverse aging could help researchers develop treatments for age-related diseases, such as arthritis or Parkinson’s, says Vittorio Sebastiano, a developmental biologist at Stanford University School of Medicine who was not involved in the work. In such diseases, certain cells might become dysfunctional due to damage. Resetting the age of those cells could prevent them from causing problems.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that this rejuvenation period “can be leveraged and hijacked somehow to basically try to promote similar processes of rejuvenation in normal cells,” Sebastiano says.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vadim Gladyshev, a biochemist and geneticist who studies aging at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, and colleagues used molecular clocks to predict the approximate ages of mouse embryos in the early stages of development. The clocks measure epigenetic changes, chemical tags on DNA that can accrue as cells age or are exposed to things like pollution. Such tags can change a gene’s activity but not the information that the gene contains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scientists were studying the embryos’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/healthy-old-age-may-trump-immortality&quot;&gt;biological ages&lt;/a&gt;, which refers to the function and health of cells, in contrast with chronological ages, which mark time in years (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/13/16&lt;/em&gt;). By tracking epigenetic changes, the team found that the age of the mouse embryos stayed constant during the first stages of cell division immediately following fertilization. But by around 6.5 to 7.5 days into development, after an embryo attached to the uterus, the average biological age of embryos had dipped — a sign that cells were undergoing some type of rejuvenation event. A mouse embryo’s ground zero may be somewhere between 4.5 to 10.5 days after fertilization, the researchers say. At some point during development, though the exact point is still unclear, mouse embryos’ biological age then began to climb.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studying human embryos at the earliest stages of development is prohibited, so similar data for humans was unavailable, Gladyshev says. But some human embryos that were slightly farther along in development than the mouse embryos didn’t immediately age, a hint that a similar process happens in people.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study is a first step and “poses more questions than answers,” Sebastiano says, “which is great.” Some of those questions: What mechanism pushes cells to reset their age? Are there specific genes that drive the process? Do all living things rejuvenate in this way?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, there’s reason to be cautious about interpreting the results, says Yamashita, who was not involved in the study. It’s possible that epigenetic changes are only part of the story, so relying solely on them could lead to miscalculations. Other factors linked to a cell’s biological age, for instance, include whether a cell has multiple copies of specific genes. As a result, the clocks that measure epigenetic changes might not pinpoint the precise “ground zero” for germline cells. Future work might uncover other phenomena that help measure cells’ age, Yamashita says.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dragon-man-skull-homo-longi-human-evolution-neandertals"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3100802</id>
		<updated>2021-06-25T15:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A fossil skull nicknamed “Dragon Man” has surfaced in China under mysterious circumstances, with big news for Neandertals. Dragon Man belonged to a previously unrecognized Stone Age species that replaces Neandertals as the closest known relatives of people today, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A nearly complete male skull now housed in the Geoscience Museum of Hebei GEO University in Shijiazhuang, China, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/the-innovation/fulltext/S2666-6758(21)00055-2&quot;&gt;represents a species dubbed &lt;em&gt;Homo longi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Hebei GEO paleoanthropologist Xijun Ni and his colleagues. The scientists describe the skull, which dates to at least 146,000 years ago, and analyze its position in &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; evolution in three papers published June 25 in &lt;em&gt;The Innovation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qiang Ji, a paleontologist also at Hebei GEO, received the skull in 2018 from a farmer who said the fossil had been dug up by a coworker of his grandfather’s in 1933. During bridge construction over a river in Harbin, China, the worker allegedly scooped the skull out of river sediment. Whether or not that story is true, this fossil could help answer questions about a poorly understood period of human evolution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Harbin cranium presents a combination of features setting it apart from other &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; species,” Ji says. The name &lt;em&gt;H. longi&lt;/em&gt; derives from a Chinese term for the province where it was found, which translates as “dragon river.” That term inspired the nickname Dragon Man.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;As in &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, the Harbin skull held a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/the-innovation/fulltext/S2666-6758(21)00057-6&quot;&gt; large brain situated atop a relatively short face&lt;/a&gt; and small cheek bones. But traits such as a long, low braincase, thick brow ridges, large molars and almost square eye sockets recall several extinct &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; populations or species, including Neandertals and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/broken-hill-skull-fossil-may-be-from-african-ghost-population&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;H. heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/1/20&lt;/em&gt;). Those species date to a key period of &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; evolution called the Middle Pleistocene, which ran from about 789,000 to 130,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measures of the decay of radioactive uranium in the Harbin skull provided its&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/the-innovation/fulltext/S2666-6758(21)00056-4&quot;&gt; minimum age estimate of 146,000 years&lt;/a&gt;. Chemical analyses of the fossil and sediment still attached to it indicate an origin in the Harbin area, even if the researchers can’t confirm the farmer’s story to Ji.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;illustration of Dragon Man in a forest setting&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100805&quot; height=&quot;495&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/062421_bb_dragonman_inline1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100805&quot;&gt;An artist’s reconstruction shows an adult male, based on a nearly complete fossil skull, who belonged to a newly proposed &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; species that lived at least 146,000 years ago in what’s now northern China.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100805&quot;&gt;Chuang Zhao&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers estimated Dragon Man’s evolutionary status using statistical comparisons to other Middle Pleistocene &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; fossils from Africa, Asia and Europe. These comparisons indicated that &lt;em&gt;H. longi&lt;/em&gt; shared a common ancestor with &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; around 949,000 years ago, while the common ancestor of Neandertals and &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; dated to just over 1 million years ago. If so, then &lt;em&gt;H. longi&lt;/em&gt; had a slightly closer evolutionary relationship to &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; than Neandertals did.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ni’s team concludes that &lt;em&gt;H. longi&lt;/em&gt; was a contemporary of evolving Asian lines of &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, Neandertals and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-denisovan-hominid-fossils-dna-top-science-stories-2019-yir&quot;&gt;Denisovans&lt;/a&gt;, a population known mainly from ancient DNA (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/16/19&lt;/em&gt;). The Harbin skull most closely resembles several other Middle Pleistocene &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; fossils from Chinese sites, the researchers say. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-denisovan-dna-outside-siberia-found-tibetan-plateau-cave&quot;&gt;Some of those finds are now regarded as Denisovans&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/29/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attempts will be made to extract DNA from and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jawbone-shows-denisovans-lived-tibetan-plateau-long-humans&quot;&gt;identify the protein structure&lt;/a&gt; of the Harbin skull for comparison to Denisovans, says Chris Stringer, a paleoanthropologist at the Natural History Museum in London and a member of Ni’s team (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/1/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Analyses of the geographic distribution of various skeletal traits in Middle Pleistocene &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; fossils indicate that relatively small groups from various species and populations traveled within Africa, Asia and Europe, sometimes interbreeding. Ni’s team suspects that groups based in southern areas, where they could survive during periods of extreme cold, ventured farther when temperatures warmed. Treks were made back and forth across continents, most often from Africa to Asia, the investigators say. Some groups died out along the way, while others eventually passed on genes and skeletal traits over great distances, they suspect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That scenario seems likely, especially given the surprising mix of features on the Harbin skull, says paleoanthropologist Katerina Harvati of Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen in Germany, who did not participate in the new studies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; groups frequently traversed what’s now northern China as temperatures warmed and rainy periods fluctuated after around 300,000 years ago, says paleoanthropologist Sheela Athreya of Texas A&amp;amp;M University in College Station, who also was not involved in the new studies.  But she argues that the Harbin skull looks much like several other Middle Pleistocene &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; fossils from northern China and shouldn’t be classified as a new species.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ancient &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; groups on the move evolved unique features during periods of isolation and shared features during periods of contact and mating, she proposes. Intermittent connections across vast areas created closely related populations that inherited varying sets of traits. The Harbin skull and newly described Israeli fossils, classified only as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/israel-fossil-new-hominid-nesher-ramla-homo-human-evolution&quot;&gt;Nesher Ramla &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, display anatomical variations on a Middle Pleistocene &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; theme, Athreya says (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/24/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We all experience a phenomenon called “generational amnesia”, where we forget the ways in which previous generations shaped the world&lt;/strong&gt;. And that makes it harder to solve global problems like climate change, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210623-generational-amnesia-the-memory-loss-that-harms-the-planet&quot;&gt;writes Richard Fisher&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;: if we think of the state of the world in our own youth as the “baseline”, then it’s harder to recognise long-term climate trends or declines in animal populations, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have found that greying hairs can become their original colour again.&lt;/strong&gt; The small study showed that the point at which a hair turns grey often coincides with a period of stress, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gray-hair-can-return-to-its-original-color-mdash-and-stress-is-involved-of-course/&quot;&gt;reports Diana Kwon&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt; — and that it can sometimes return to its previous colour during a particularly relaxing time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Cognitive flexibility” refers to the ability to adapt your behaviour and the way you think in a changing environment.&lt;/strong&gt; And the skill is key to creativity, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/iq-tests-cant-measure-it-but-cognitive-flexibility-is-key-to-learning-and-creativity-163284&quot;&gt;write Barbara Sahakian and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, who argue that many of humanity’s greatest achievements have relied on people who are particularly flexible, rather than those with high IQs.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Dark matter can be a real drag. The pull of that unidentified, invisible matter in the Milky Way may be slowing down the rotating bar of stars at the galaxy’s heart.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on a technique that re-creates the history of the slowdown in a manner akin to analyzing a tree’s rings, the bar’s speed has &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/505/2/2412/6237521&quot;&gt;decreased by at least 24 percent&lt;/a&gt; since it formed billions of years ago, researchers report in the August &lt;em&gt;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That slowdown is “another indirect but important piece of evidence that dark matter is a thing, not just a conjecture, because this can’t happen without it,” says astrophysicist Martin Weinberg of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who was not involved with the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many spiral galaxies, including the Milky Way, contain a central bar-shaped region densely packed with stars and surrounded by the galaxy’s pinwheeling arms. The bar also has some groupies: a crew of stars trapped by the bar’s gravitational influence. Those stars orbit a gravitationally stable point located alongside the bar and farther from the galaxy’s center, known as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-solar-storms-earth-havoc-space-weather-forecasts&quot;&gt;Lagrange point&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/26/21&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;If the bar’s rotation slows, it will grow in length, and the bar’s tagalongs will also move outward. As that happens, that cohort of hangers-on will gather additional stars. According to computer simulations of the process, those additional stars should arrange themselves in layers on the outside of the group, says astrophysicist Ralph Schönrich of University College London. The layers of stars imprint a record of the group’s growth. “It’s actually like a tree that you can cut up in your own galaxy,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Schönrich and astrophysicist Rimpei Chiba of the University of Oxford studied how the composition of stars in the group changed from its outer edge to its deeper layers. Data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia spacecraft revealed that stars in the outer layers of the bar tended to be less enriched in elements heavier than helium than were stars in the inner layers. That’s evidence for the group of stars moving outward, as a result of the bar slowing, the researchers say. That’s because stars in the center of the galaxy — which would have glommed on to the group in the more distant past — tend to be more enriched in heavier elements than those farther out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bar’s slowdown hints that a gravitational force is acting on it, namely, the pull of dark matter in the galaxy. Normal matter alone wouldn’t be enough to reduce the bar’s speed. “If there is no dark matter, the bar will not slow down,” Chiba says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the results have drawn some skepticism. “Unfortunately, this is not yet convincing to me,” says astrophysicist Isaac Shlosman of the University of Kentucky in Lexington. For example, he doubts that the tree ring layering would really occur. It is “hard to believe that this is the case in a realistic system” as opposed to in a simplified computer simulation, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Weinberg, on the other hand, says that although the study relies on a variety of assumptions, he suspects it’s correct. “It’s got the right smell.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12441&quot; style=&quot;width: 315px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12441&quot; height=&quot;195&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/Schematic-representation-of-mechanism-of-action-of-fluorescent-Pseudomonas-in-rhizosphere.jpg&quot; width=&quot;305&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Akansha Jain, Sampa Das, CC BY 4.0 via Wikimedia Commons&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas fragi&lt;/em&gt; A13BB, recovered as part of study to identify novel antibiotic-producing bacterial strains from soil samples collected from the rhizosphere, has been sequenced for antibiotic producing gene clusters and has been published as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenomdata.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12863-021-00969-0&quot;&gt;first Data &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenomdata.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12863-021-00969-0&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Genomic Data&lt;/em&gt;.  Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are one of the components of the rhizosphere, where they promote plant growth by enhancing uptake of nutrients, inorganic elements, or by increasing resistance to heavy metals, high salt concentrations, phytopathogens and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two β-lactone secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (smBGC) known for their antibiotic, antiobesity and anticancer properties, were identified and demonstrated low homology (20%) to known smBGCs. A siderophore (a small compound secreted usually to transfer iron across cell membranes) smBGC was identified even though &lt;em&gt;P. fragi&lt;/em&gt; is considered a non-siderophore producing member of the genus &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A major cause of death and sickness in these countries is nutrition-related chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found there was an increase in SB imports into pacific island countries between these dates which needs to be considered for health implications by both exporting and importing countries as this has a detrimental impact on diet and self-sufficiency. Diet high in processed foods is well known to have an impact on health. There was a statistically significant increase in SB imports to Tonga but too little data for assessment of taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12444&quot; style=&quot;width: 266px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12444 size-full&quot; height=&quot;170&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/Ankara_healthcare_workers_murals_2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;256&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Murat Karabulut via Wikimedia Commons&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty five members of NHS secondary mental health services (England) undertook an interview based study and were found to face difficulties that impacted significantly on their well-being during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lockdown in England in response to the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-19 had impact on all Healthcare workers but that on the mental Healthcare workers has been under-reported. The quality of life for respondents was affected by their challenge of providing care in constrained and potentially dangerous situations and losing patients to the disease. Taking on additional tasks to provide a better service for their patients led to additional strain. Feelings of grief, helplessness, isolation, distress, and burnout were all reported. The response to the pandemic meant that services had to rapidly adapt to major incident mode at the same time as the needs of service users increased. Moral injury has resulted to some after exposure to this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-021-03261-8&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; has pointed to areas where additional support could be targeted. One Implication is loss of staff but this has not been explicitly stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cells from donors with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can now be grown into brain organoids and the resulting research is opening up our understanding of the aetiology of ASD. Brain organoids are allowing the exploration into genetic, developmental and other factors involved which makes this unique from other forms of research. Researchers often incorporate the medical model of disability into ASD research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neurodiversity movement is likely to disagree with approaches and aims of cerebral research in ASD as the developmental disability movement and paradigm understands autism as a form of human diversity and advocates a model based on social, attitudinal, and environmental barriers rather than any deficits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12443&quot; style=&quot;width: 239px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12443&quot; height=&quot;172&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/Organoid_during_development_48062903426.jpg&quot; width=&quot;229&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;NIH Image Gallery from Bethesda, Maryland, USA, via Wikimedia Commons&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-021-00627-1&quot;&gt;authors&lt;/a&gt; give three recommendations that should minimise any conflict and achieve a more holistic, inclusive approach to cerebral organoid research on ASD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 – neurodiverse individuals should be included as co-creators in both the scientific process and research communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 – clinicians and neurodiverse communities should have open and respectful communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 – a continual reconceptualization of illness, impairment, disability, behavior, and person should be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers are advised to be careful not to combine disease with impairment or disability and also consider how best to communicate their ideas with respect and care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Endocrine Disorders&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcendocrdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12902-021-00712-x?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;The effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on women with gestational diabetes mellitus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as impaired glucose tolerance with onset or first recognized during pregnancy. It is fairly prevalent with a figure of 15-20% reported globally. Hyperglycaemia is associated with adverse outcomes for mother and baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12445&quot; style=&quot;width: 233px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12445&quot; height=&quot;149&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/640px-Pregnancy_-_belly.jpg&quot; width=&quot;223&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Towle Neu, CC BY 2.5 via Wikimedia Commons&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin and mineral supplementation such as vitamin D, vitamin E, magnesium, and selenium  may regulate glucose metabolism and have beneficial roles in anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress.; does it help in GDM? The effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on women with GDM have not been well established but this &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcendocrdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12902-021-00712-x&quot;&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; hoped to rectify that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Authors’ findings are that vitamin and mineral supplementation; magnesium, zinc, selenium, calcium, vitamin D and E (alone or in combination), significantly improved glycemic control, lessened inflammation and oxidative stress in women with GDM through decreasing serum Fasting Plasma Glucose, insulin, and other levels, and increasing total antioxidant capacity levels.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We’re always evolving our services to make sharing discoveries as easy as possible for researchers. To help authors save time and effort in the article submission process, all PLOS journals offer format-free initial submission for authors submitting research articles. Learn more about this service before you get started on your next submission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Format-Free Submission?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Format-free submission is part of our 3-step submission process which includes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial submission. &lt;/strong&gt;Participating journals waive all formatting requirements and will request formatting changes only after initial editorial evaluation or initial peer review depending on the journal. Simply upload your manuscript in a single PDF file (which can include text and figures) and submit to the journal’s online submission system. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editorial assessment. &lt;/strong&gt;Our editors and reviewers review and provide initial feedback on your submission as quickly as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full submission. &lt;/strong&gt;Make any additional formatting changes only after initial feedback is received. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, these 3 steps are designed to help ease initial submission so you spend as little time in the article submission process as possible. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To ensure your format-free submission is complete and gets handled as quickly as possible, be sure to review the submission checklists and guidelines provided by our journal editorial teams. Click a journal name below to learn more:&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A gecko named Mr. Frosty and his kin have helped scientists uncover the genetic glitch that gives these lizards their standout color — and their high risk for skin tumors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The geckos are a variety of leopard gecko (&lt;em&gt;Eublepharis macularius&lt;/em&gt;) called Lemon Frost, which sports stark white skin that not only highlights its yellow coloring, but also tends to develop tumors. A new study &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1009580&quot;&gt;pegs these Lemon Frost traits to a single gene&lt;/a&gt; that has also been implicated in the skin cancer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eating-lot-fiber-could-improve-some-cancer-treatments&quot;&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt; in people (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/1/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that Lemon Frost geckos could be used to investigate new treatments for skin cancer, researchers report online June 24 in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was extremely exciting that they could link the Lemon Frost characteristics to a specific region of the genome,” says Ylenia Chiari, an evolutionary biologist at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., who wasn’t involved in the work. “Studying a gecko is not only about the gecko’s health or about understanding basic biology, but could also provide key information to further research on other organisms, including humans.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Over the last few decades, reptile breeders have produced a wide variety of leopard geckos, ranging from vibrant orange to black or spotted to striped. “It’s just amazing that one particular species can display such a variety of different colors and patterns,” says Longhua Guo, a geneticist at UCLA. Curious about the genetics underlying this rainbow of reptiles, Guo first visited a gecko breeding facility in California in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“It has shelves and shelves of cages, and you can hear crickets everywhere, because they feed these geckos crickets,” says Guo, who was immediately charmed by the colorful creatures. “They are very gentle and docile. You can hold them on your hand, and they just look at you with their big googly eyes, and their mouth always looks like they have on a big smile.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The owner of the facility, Steve Sykes, had bred a whole spectrum of leopard geckos. But he was particularly concerned about his Lemon Frost variety. After purchasing a Lemon Frost gecko named Mr. Frosty at a reptile auction, Sykes had bred Mr. Frosty with various female leopard geckos to establish a colony of more than 900 lizards. But more than 80 percent of the Lemon Frost geckos developed tumors made of white skin cells before the reptiles were 5 years old. In some geckos, the tumors grew into large bulges that could make it difficult for the animals to move and could get infected if ruptured.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;images of the undersides of a non-Lemon Frost gecko and two Lemon Frost geckos&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3100773&quot; height=&quot;393&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/062321_MT_gecko_inline-1.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3100773&quot;&gt;Unlike non–Lemon Frost geckos (left), lizards of the Lemon Frost variety tend to develop white skin tumors (black arrows) on their undersides (middle and right).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3100773&quot;&gt;L. Guo &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/em&gt; 2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To uncover the gene responsible for the tumors, Guo and colleagues collected DNA from lizards’ saliva. The researchers deciphered the genetic makeup of about 30 geckos that inherited the Lemon Frost traits from both parents, over 100 others that inherited the traits from only one parent and nearly 40 non–Lemon Frost geckos. Comparing the genetic material of these geckos allowed the team to trace the Lemon Frost tumors and coloring to a mutation on a gene called &lt;em&gt;SPINT1&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This gene has not only been linked to cancer in humans, but also with tumor formation in fish and mice. This offers further evidence that &lt;em&gt;SPINT1&lt;/em&gt; is responsible for tumor growth in Lemon Frost geckos, says study coauthor Leonid Kruglyak, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator also at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the reptiles, the mutation may cause an overproduction of white skin cells, giving the geckos both their signature frosted appearance and liability to develop tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Psychology is great at confirming — or challenging — all the old sayings. We’ve previously looked at studies examining whether it’s true that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/22/resolving-arguments-can-prevent-bad-feelings-from-lingering-and-we-get-better-at-it-as-we-age/&quot;&gt;you shouldn’t go to bed on an argument&lt;/a&gt;”, that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2010/01/27/time-flew-by-i-must-have-been-enjoying-myself/&quot;&gt;time flies when you’re having fun&lt;/a&gt;”, and that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/03/06/smarter-people-are-happier-says-new-analysis-involving-80000-participants-but-only-a-bit/&quot;&gt;ignorance is bliss&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/19485506211019923&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science &lt;/em&gt;has investigated whether “revenge is sweet”. Andreas B. Eder and colleagues at Julius-Maximilians-University of Würzburg find that people do seem to get something positive out of exacting revenge — but it can leave a bitter aftertaste too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42669&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some studies have found that retaliation can make the victim of a transgression feel better. But other work suggests that people overestimate how good revenge will make them feel, or that they actually end up feeling bad.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it does both, reasoned the authors of the new study: you might feel good straight after taking revenge, but the very act of retaliation could remind you of the original transgression and make you feel a bit miserable. If that’s the case, then you’d expect that “sweet” feeling to be an immediate, fleeting response, which might not show up if you just ask people about their feelings. So instead, the team decided to test people’s responses to enacting revenge using a more indirect measure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants played a game testing their reaction times, supposedly against two other players via the internet (unbeknownst to the participants, these other “players” weren’t real). Before each round, they had to nominate one of the other players to be blasted with noise if they won. But if they lost, they either received a sound blast themselves from the winning player, or saw the other losing player receive the sound blast. (In reality, who won or lost was determined solely by the computer). Crucially, one of the players picked on the participant when they won, usually blasting the participant with sound rather than the other player, while the other player didn’t show a preference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants also completed a “punishment” task. They saw images of the two other players with a border that quickly alternated between the two pictures, and had to hit a key when it highlighted the player they wanted to punish (again, with a loud noise). If participants were out for revenge, then presumably they would choose to punish the player who had been picking on them. But for a few of the trials — unknown to the participants – the computer made the decision for them, half the time choosing to punish the provoking player and half the time choosing the non-provoking player. These were the trials the researchers were interested in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, after each trial participants completed the “affect misattribution procedure”. This involves viewing a Chinese character and rating it as pleasant or unpleasant — it’s considered an indirect measure of how a participant is feeling at that point in time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that people were more likely to rate Chinese characters as pleasant after they punished the player who had been picking on them than after they punished the non-provoking player. But this was only true of participants who showed “revenge-seeking” behaviour (i.e. those who chose to blast the provoking player more often with noise). So the results suggested that revenge-seeking people do feel more positive after taking revenge against someone who has wronged them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But an alternative interpretation was that participants felt &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; after punishing the non-provoking player. To figure out whether this was the case, in a second study the team added an option to not punish either player. Revenge-seeking participants again rated the Chinese characters as more pleasant after punishing the provoking player compared to the non-provoking player. But, interestingly, their response was even &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;positive when no-one was punished.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results show that revenge “is neither wholly sweet nor wholly bitter”, the authors conclude. People generally feel bad after punishing someone, they write — but if they are taking revenge on a transgressor then they experience a certain amount of pleasure which counteracts some (but not all) of those bad feelings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are some obvious limitations to the study. As the authors note, it’s unclear exactly what processes are at play when rating Chinese characters (in fact, some researchers have argued that people’s responses on this test are not as “implicit” as assumed). And of course, transgressions and acts of revenge in real life are going to be very different from this artificial, lab-based task. Still, it’s an interesting piece of research that shows that our feelings and behaviours are far more nuanced than the old sayings imply.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/19485506211019923&quot;&gt;Sweet Revenge Feels Less Bitter: Spontaneous Affective Reactions After Revenge Taking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foraging is a vital behavioral task for living organisms. Behavioral
strategies and abstract mathematical models thereof have been
described in detail for various species. To explore the link between
underlying neural circuits and computational principles, we present
how a biologically detailed neural circuit model of the insect
mushroom body implements sensory processing, learning, and motor
control. We focus on cast and surge strategies employed by flying
insects when foraging within turbulent odor plumes. Using a spike-
based plasticity rule, the model rapidly learns to associate
individual olfactory sensory cues paired with food in a classical
conditioning paradigm. We show that, without retraining, the system
dynamically recalls memories to detect relevant cues in complex
sensory scenes. Accumulation of this sensory evidence on short time
scales generates cast-and-surge motor commands. Our generic systems
approach predicts that population sparseness facilitates learning,
while temporal sparseness is required for dynamic memory recall and
precise behavioral control. Our work successfully combines biological
computational principles with spike-based machine learning. It shows
how knowledge transfer from static to arbitrary complex dynamic
conditions can be achieved by foraging insects and may serve as
inspiration for agent-based machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across the world, birth rates are dropping. The global fertility rate &lt;a href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate&quot;&gt;has halved since 1950&lt;/a&gt;, with indications that this will continue to fall. There are a number of suggestions as to why this is the case: women may stay in education or the workforce rather than have multiple children, for instance, and many people across the world now have much greater access to contraception.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But many adults are also explicitly deciding not to have children, instead choosing to be “childfree”. The childfree movement has grown rapidly over the last few years: the ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://reddit.com/r/childfree&quot;&gt;r/Childfree&lt;/a&gt;’ subreddit has over 1.4 million subscribers, whilst &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/childfree&quot;&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stylist.co.uk/health/fertility-women-over-30-child-free-life-lessons/474526&quot;&gt;coverage&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,2148636,00.html&quot;&gt;proliferated&lt;/a&gt; in the UK and US.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But are the childfree missing out on the joys that come from parenthood? According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0252528&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;, that isn’t the case: childfree adults are just as satisfied with their lives as parents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42647&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants, 1000 adults from Michigan in the United States, were either parents, child&lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; (had no children but wanted them) or child&lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; (had no children and didn’t want them). They completed several scales, including measures of life satisfaction and of the Big Five personality traits, before rating on a scale from 0 to 100 how cold or warm they felt towards both women and men who do not ever want to have biological or adopted children. Finally, the team also collected demographic data, including information on participants’ race, gender, education, age, political ideology and relationship status — whether someone was partnered, formerly partnered (e.g. divorced, separated or widowed) or single.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over a quarter of participants were childfree, the second biggest group after parents. At first, it appeared that childfree participants had lower life satisfaction than parents — but this difference disappeared after controlling for gender, education, age and relationship status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Childfree participants were also more likely to be left-wing or liberal compared to parents. “Not yet parents” — those who did not have children yet but hoped to in the future — were slightly more agreeable than childfree participants, but there were no other differences in personality between the groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Warmness towards childfree women and men also depended on the parenting status of participants. Childfree people felt warmer towards childfree women and men while childless individuals and parents felt significantly colder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A common refrain on forums such as r/Childfree is that many parents insinuate — or say outright — that their childfree counterparts couldn’t possibly be as happy as them. This research seems to suggest that isn’t the case. However, despite the fact that childfree adults are just as satisfied with their lives as parents, they are still considered by others to be an outgroup, with parents and childless individuals feeling significantly colder towards them than other childfree people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further research could look at the variety of reasons why people choose not to have children: in this study, personality didn’t seem to make much of a difference while political ideology did, so exploring the direction of this effect may be interesting. Whether it’s to do with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/08/why-i-dont-have-a-child-i-dont-have-enough-money&quot;&gt;finances&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/give-up-having-children-couples-save-planet-climate-crisis&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/a&gt;, or gender roles, looking more closely at the political, economic and social factors that lead people to becoming childfree could give insight into the complex components of the decision to have — or not have — children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0252528&quot;&gt;Prevalence and characteristics of childfree adults in Michigan (USA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;90&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/logo-bmcproc-pr-140x90.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greater inclusion of individuals from underrepresented demographics in STEM fields has long been a goal for many disciplines. As the culture of STEM evolves towards greater inclusivity, providing equitable access to talented individuals of all backgrounds has become a key priority. Diversity not only in academic expertise but in demographics is increasingly recognized as a source of collective strength that correlates with success and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific societies have historically sought to cultivate diverse membership through an educational model that supports scientist participation in activities that prepare them for upcoming career transitions. While this methodology is broadly applied across many different disciplines, societies are now coordinating their efforts and using data to evaluate outcomes and identify &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lifescied.org/doi/full/10.1187/cbe.19-11-0262&quot;&gt;opportunities&lt;/a&gt; to improve impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process, scientific societies have found themselves well-suited to offer field-specific career development opportunities that complement the traditional instruction and training provided at academic institutions. Trainees in the process of developing into independent academic scientists must cultivate a combination of disciplinary knowledge and complementary soft skills in order to navigate demands such as grant-writing, collaboration, mentoring, and publishing—skills that are fundamental to success in the professoriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from backgrounds that are underrepresented in STEM are less likely to have access to mentoring, making it more challenging to develop the soft skills necessary to facilitate success as tenure-track faculty. Scientific society professional development programming geared towards these scientists can have an equalizer effect, enabling them to successfully build their academic niche and professorial career in field areas of interest to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;BioMed Central&lt;/a&gt; (BMC) such as science, technology, engineering and medicine. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jmbe.v21i1.1941&quot;&gt;Minorities Affairs Committee (MAC) of the American Society for Cell Biology&lt;/a&gt; (ASCB) has a strong track record of creating professional development programs to help relieve these disparities in access to mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of ASCB MAC programming is its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ascb.org/career-development/2021-accomplishing-career-transitions-act-program/&quot;&gt;Accomplishing Career Transitions (ACT) program&lt;/a&gt;. ACT engages cell biologists who are starting out their independent careers to individualize their professional development and training through a longitudinal mentoring framework. ASCB aims to prepare ACT Fellows for a successful transition into the academic STEM workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new BMC Proceedings Supplement, highlights topics including effective mentorship, obtaining a faculty position, starting a lab, preparing for tenure and promotion, and professional development through experiential learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of this BMC Proceedings Supplement is more important now than ever, as rising faculty adapt their career trajectories to global challenges. Our short term goal with this &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-15-supplement-2&quot;&gt;BMC Proceedings Supplement&lt;/a&gt; is to make the ACT program available to a wider range of  scientists to help them prepare for success in academia. Their success will contribute to a diverse professoriate that is inclusive and welcoming of the next generation of scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this 1930 painting, “Rhythm, Joy of Life”, by French artist Robert Delaunay. Do you find it colourful? And do you like it?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-42628&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;42628&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;0&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;1024px-Robert_Delaunay_-_Rythme_Joie_de_vivre-1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1024px-Robert_Delaunay_-_Rythme_Joie_de_vivre-1.jpg?fit=845%2C737&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1024px-Robert_Delaunay_-_Rythme_Joie_de_vivre-1.jpg?fit=300%2C262&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1024px-Robert_Delaunay_-_Rythme_Joie_de_vivre-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C893&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1024,893&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/21/we-like-the-original-versions-of-abstract-artworks-more-than-colour-shifted-ones/1024px-robert_delaunay_-_rythme_joie_de_vivre-1/&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;371&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1024px-Robert_Delaunay_-_Rythme_Joie_de_vivre-1.jpg?resize=426%2C371&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; width=&quot;426&quot; /&gt;Robert Delaunay – Rhythm, Joy of Life (1930)&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now what if every pixel in a digital version was rotated an equal distance on a “colour wheel” that represents every colour that people can see? Technically, the number of different colours in the image would be the same — but you’d probably perceive it to be &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; colourful. And, even if you’d never seen the original before, you’d probably like it less.  That, at least, is the conclusion of a fascinating &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2021-45647-001.pdf&quot;&gt;new paper &lt;/a&gt;in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance&lt;/em&gt;. The work contributes to our understanding not only of why certain colours are more common in art, but also of how we perceive colour.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42625&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carolin S. Altmann and colleagues at the Experimental Aesthetics Group at Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Germany, first identified 100 colourful abstract artworks by well-known artists. They then rotated each through a 360-degree wheel of perceivable colours, in steps of 60 degrees at a time. This gave them six differently coloured digital versions of each artwork, so 600 images in total. Twenty young participants with normal vision used six-point scales to rate each version of every artwork for “colourfulness” and, separately (on another day), for how much they liked them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-42631&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;42631&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;0&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;rotations&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rotations.png?fit=513%2C682&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rotations.png?fit=226%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rotations.png?fit=513%2C682&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;513,682&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/21/we-like-the-original-versions-of-abstract-artworks-more-than-colour-shifted-ones/rotations/&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rotations.png?resize=381%2C506&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; width=&quot;381&quot; /&gt;Rotated versions of “Rhythm, Joy of Life” used in the study. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2021-45647-001.pdf&quot;&gt;Altman &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; (2021)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that all but one of the participants felt the originals to be more colourful than the other versions. Also, about three quarters of the participants preferred the originals over the colour-shifted versions. “This effect is not only surprisingly consistent across participants, but also across images, and even survived rigorous statistical control of potentially confounding factors,” the team reports. In fact, 81% of the original images were both more liked and judged to be more colourful. The team’s analysis also revealed that the participants didn’t simply like very colourful images per se — rather, “they prefer versions of artworks that they perceive as more colourful”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each rotation included the same number of perceivable colours. So — assuming that the participants were unfamiliar with the artworks (and this isn’t reported on in the paper) — there must be something special about the colour palettes chosen by the artists, the team reasoned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their analysis revealed that three quarters of the artworks featured more yellow and orange than other hues. (This was also the case for another 113 artworks that the team had originally identified for possible inclusion in the study). Other research has also found find a bias among artists towards the yellow/orange range. So why might this be?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More yellow in a picture might make it seem closer to a scene lit by natural daylight (even if it’s an abstract image), and so preferred, the researchers suggest. But also, the human visual system is less sensitive to blueish-yellowish input than to red, say. (It’s been suggested that this made it easier for our ancestors to quickly spot reddish ripe fruit under changing light levels, from dawn to dusk.) “Potentially, artists thus have to overrepresent yellow colours in their palette to make them just as noticeable to the human observer as other colour hues with higher perceptual sensitivity,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Yellow” is also a narrow “colour category”. That is, the number of different hues that we perceive to be examples of yellow is pretty narrow; it’s much larger for red, say. So while a rotation may easily have changed a yellow pixel to one in another colour category, a red pixel may still be a type of “red” — which could make the artwork &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; to be less colourful and also less complex. Other studies have found that more complex artworks tend to get higher aesthetic ratings, so more apparently complex versions of the same painting might be preferred.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all languages use the same colour categories, however. For example, “light blue” and “dark blue” are fundamentally different categories in Russian and Greek — in which a colour cannot simply be called “blue”. It has been suggested that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/02/your-native-language-affects-what-you-can-and-cant-see/&quot;&gt;the colour categories that a person is familiar with affects their colour perception&lt;/a&gt;. It would be interesting, then, to see if a study using participants who use different colour categories would give different results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that the majority of participants in this study were women, and other work has found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/men-and-women-see-things-differently-literally-180954815/&quot;&gt;men and women don’t perceive colours in quite the same way&lt;/a&gt;. There are, then, still a lot of questions in relation to this work — but it’ll be really interesting to see what the answers turn out to be. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-45647-001&quot;&gt;Liking of Art and the Perception of Color&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 The misconduct case of an endodontics researcher in Japan who already has lost at least 24 papers for data problems has claimed two more casualties: the PhD theses of a pair of scientists he once helped train. As we reported last year,  Nobuaki Ozeki, who retired from Aichi Gakuin University in 2018, was found to … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/21/pulp-fiction-japanese-university-revokes-two-phds-in-case-involving-two-dozen-retractions/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Pulp fiction: Japanese university revokes two dentistry PhDs in case involving two dozen retractions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/iStock-1209664248.t5fce49ac.m800.eps_.pv_.xPOr4FnnT-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) was first assessed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21482743/&quot;&gt;Tangri &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. in 2011.  It was then multi-nationally evaluated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26757465/&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;.  I frequently use their &lt;a href=&quot;https://kidneyfailurerisk.com/&quot;&gt;online calculator&lt;/a&gt; to help counsel my patients in clinic but more so as informational to relieve patient concerns, and not to drive clinical practice.  The KFRE predicts the 2- and 5-year risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3a-5.  There are two forms of the equation: 4-variable and 8-variable.  The 4-variable includes age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria.  The 8-variable has these components but also incorporates serum calcium, phosphate, albumin, and bicarbonate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02402-1&quot;&gt;Ali &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; set out to validate the KFRE in advanced CKD taking into account their cause of CKD (diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and other causes.  The KFRE performed well across all diseases and was found to have adequate discrimination and calibration.  What I found to be very interesting was that the KFRE provided better clinical utility for decision-making like pre-ESKD planning than basing it on GFR cutoffs alone.  Typically, we start planning for transplant evaluations, dialysis education, dialysis access placement, etc when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ajkd.org/article/S0272-6386(15)01019-7/pdf&quot;&gt;eGFR is &amp;lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2&lt;/a&gt; (in this study they used &amp;lt; 20 and &amp;lt; 15 mL/min/1.73m2).  with using the KFRE in Ali &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, they identified more patients who were likely to progress to ESKD and delay in others by using KFRE thresholds of &amp;gt; 40% for 2-year risk and &amp;gt; 50% for 5-year risk of ESKD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying patients who are progressing to ESKD is kept in planning for dialysis modality, access placement, and transplant referral.  If we can catch individuals early and start the process then there are fewer hospitalizations and poor outcomes.  Other studies have addressed using the KFRE in the necessity of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28835850/&quot;&gt;nephrology referrals&lt;/a&gt; and using it as a risk-based approach to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29375884&quot;&gt;guide CKD care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my review of the literature and Ali &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;.’s article, I definitely will start using the KFRE in my clinical assessment and planning for patients with advanced CKD.  Maybe it will help identify those patients who will benefit from early referral to transplant and access placement or at the least early education endeavors for those patients.  I can only see positives from using the KFRE as another clinical tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are other additional uses of the KFRE in your practice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you noticed an increase in scam texts recently?&lt;/strong&gt; I certainly have — and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210611-how-fraudsters-exploited-our-fears-during-the-pandemic&quot;&gt;so has David Robson&lt;/a&gt;, writing at &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;.  These scammers often make it seem like we are facing some immediate threat like legal trouble or loss of money, capitalising on the fact that in this kind of situation we are less likely to think and act rationally. And the pandemic has provided just the right conditions for these scams to flourish, Robson writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42600&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As we mentioned &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/04/magic-tricks-and-media-literacy-the-weeks-best-psychology-links/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a couple of weeks ago&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, the idea that groups succumb to “groupthink” is hotly contested.&lt;/strong&gt; This week at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/how-humans-think-when-they-think-group/&quot;&gt;Annie Murphy Paul takes a look at the more positive side of group cognition&lt;/a&gt;, drawing on a fascinating case study in which sailors on board an out-of-control aircraft carrier worked together to narrowly avert disaster. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Australian study has found that primary-aged kids perform better when their schools are surrounded by more green spaces. &lt;/strong&gt;It’s not simply the case that these schools are attended by children from wealthier families, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/green-space-around-primary-schools-may-improve-students-academic-performance-161673&quot;&gt;write the researchers Alison Carver and Amanda J Wheeler&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, because the research compared schools with similar socioeconomic backgrounds. Instead, the pair suggests that the effect could be related to reduced pollution near schools with more greenery, or de-stressing effects of the green spaces themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paying too much attention to something can distort our perceptions of the world,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyche.co/ideas/sometimes-paying-attention-means-we-see-the-world-less-clearly&quot;&gt;argues Henry Taylor&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Psyche&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could brands one day insert advertisements into your dreams?&lt;/strong&gt; That’s the fear of a group of dream researchers, who have released an open letter calling for “dream manipulation” to be regulated, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/06/are-advertisers-coming-your-dreams&quot;&gt;reports Sofia Moutinho&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have found that when exposed to the common antidepressant citalopram, crayfish become bolder, emerging out of their shelters more readily to look for food. &lt;/strong&gt;The study was conducted in the lab, but used levels of antidepressants which have previously been found in streams, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/antidepressant-pollution-in-water-may-make-crayfish-bolder&quot;&gt;reports Douglas Main&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt;. This suggests that in the wild, antidepressant drugs which make their way into the environment via wastewater could affect the animals’ behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We’re pleased to announce a new arXivLabs collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.litmaps.co/&quot;&gt;Litmaps&lt;/a&gt;. The new &lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXivLabs&lt;/a&gt; feature allows arXiv users to quickly generate a citation map of the top connected articles, and then explore the citation network using the Litmaps research platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A citation network is a visualization of the literature cited by a research paper. The network shows how papers are related to each other in terms of concepts, subject areas, and history — and they’re valuable for &lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hgKElc&quot;&gt;analyzing the development of research areas, making decisions on research directions, and assessing the impacts of research, researchers, institutes, countries, and individual papers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers can now view a Litmap citation network for a specific paper, directly from the arXiv abstract page by clicking on the “Bibliographic Tools” tab at the bottom of an abstract page and activating “Litmaps.” Using this tool, arXiv readers can now easily jump from articles they are interested in and use Litmaps’ custom visualization and automated search tools to find other critical articles they may have missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An arXivLabs Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to be able to offer arXiv readers new visual ways to explore scientific literature. Litmaps will enrich the arXiv reading experience and help readers find what they need,” said Eleonora Presani, executive director of arXiv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tool supports arXiv’s mission to provide an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant, emerging science and establish their contribution to advancing research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are arXiv users ourselves at Litmaps, so it’s great to be able to collaborate and integrate with arXiv, which is a key resource for the research community,” said Axton Pitt, cofounder of Litmaps. The company aims to make the process of literature discovery easy and fun, and welcomes feedback via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LitmapsApp&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:team@litmaps.co&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gambling is big business in the UK. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/health-survey-for-england/2018/health-survey-for-england-2018-supplementary-analysis-on-gambling&quot;&gt;NHS Digital&lt;/a&gt;, 57% of men and 54% of women reported gambling in 2018, while the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/about-us/statistics-and-research&quot;&gt;Gambling Commission&lt;/a&gt; suggests that online gambling grew by 8.1% from 2019 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, gambling changed quite significantly: while consumers could still buy scratchcards and lottery tickets in supermarkets and off licenses, betting shops were closed and sports matches cancelled, leading many activities to move entirely online. And according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-021-10029-y&quot;&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; from researchers at the University of Bristol, although the British public gambled less overall during lockdown, among regular gamblers, rates of &lt;em&gt;online&lt;/em&gt; gambling increased substantially. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42587&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data came from participants in a longitudinal study that has been taking place since the 1990s, who were sent extra questionnaires during the 2020 lockdown. Questions on gambling focused on activity in the previous month, with participants asked whether, and how often, they had engaged in the National Lottery, scratchcards, online gambling or betting, and other forms of gambling. The questionnaires also focused on participants’ mental health and financial security and employment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, gambling frequency reduced during lockdown — unsurprising, considering that many in-person opportunities to gamble were off-limits. This was true for both regular gamblers (those who gambled once a week or more before the pandemic) and occasional gamblers (who gambled less than weekly). However, the proportion of people taking part in online gambling activities like poker, bingo, and casino games increased sixfold among regular gamblers, and doubled among occasional gamblers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neither depression nor anxiety were linked with frequency of gambling. However, alcohol use was: people who drank heavily — more than six units more than once a week — were more likely to gamble weekly compared to not gambling at all. Finances were also relevant — people who were struggling financially even before COVID-19 hit were more likely to engage in any kind of gambling during lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not a huge surprise that online gambling increased during the pandemic: there were fewer opportunities for gambling outside of the home, and as a recreational activity, gambling may have relieved the boredom of lockdown. But the team worry that online gambling could represent a bigger threat than its offline counterpart to some groups, with young people in particular susceptible to being “sucked in” to addictive online gambling. The rise of eSports and the increasingly popular combination of gaming and gambling could be a particular issue here — overall, the Gambling Commission &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news-action-and-statistics/Statistics-and-research/Covid-19-research/Covid-19-updated-August-2020/Gambling-business-data-on-gambling-during-Covid-19-updated-August-2020.aspx&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; the biggest increase during lockdown was in bets on eSports. Increased levels of home working, too, could also lead more people, alone at home, to start gambling.                     &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The strong link between binge drinking and gambling was also of concern, lead author Alan Emond &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2021/may/online-gambling.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, as they are “both addictive behaviours which can have serious health and social consequences.” Many of those who reported gambling had also faced financial difficulties before COVID-19, another concerning finding of the study — gambling to get out of difficult financial situations could simply compound the issue, drawing people into even more debt. The team also suggests that the study may have underestimated the extent of gambling, as 70% of participants were women and men were more likely to be regular gamblers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all gambling behaviour will be problematic: many people happily buy the odd scratchcard or enter the Lottery every week without developing a serious problem. However, the links with both alcohol use and financial insecurity point to the darker side of gambling — and may suggest that digital interventions or restrictions on gambling sites could be needed to reach people who are struggling with gambling at home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are concerned about your gambling, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamcare.org.uk/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;GamCare&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; offers free information, support and counselling for problem gamblers in the UK. It runs the National Gambling Helpline (0808 8020 133) and offers face-to-face counselling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-021-10029-y&quot;&gt;Gambling by Young Adults in the UK During COVID-19 Lockdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Bente Riegler will talk about a paper &quot;Toward a New Theory of Motor Synergies&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driven by recent empirical studies, we offer a new understanding of
the degrees of freedom problem, and propose a refined concept of
synergy as a neural organization that ensures a one-to-many mapping of
variables providing for both stability of important performance
variables and flexibility of motor patterns to deal with possible
perturbations and/or secondary tasks. Empirical evidence is reviewed,
including a discussion of the operationalization of
stability/flexibility through the method of the uncontrolled manifold.
We show how this concept establishes links between the various
accounts for how movement is organized in redundant effector systems.&lt;/p&gt;

The foundation fosters and supports research on all aspects of computer vision, a field of study that develops techniques to see and interpret the visual world, with applications ranging from diagnosing disease to evaluating agricultural crop quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t donate because we were asked,” said Ramin Zabih, president and founder of CVF, Cornell Tech professor, and Google research scientist. “We donated because we love arXiv.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open access is a central tenet of the foundation, which (along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ieee.org/&quot;&gt;IEEE&lt;/a&gt;) cosponsors the two main computer vision conferences, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cvpr2021.thecvf.com/&quot;&gt;CVPR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://iccv2021.thecvf.com/home&quot;&gt;ICCV&lt;/a&gt;. Before the pandemic, CVPR drew more than 10,000 attendees. CVF also provides open access to the proceedings for these conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Without arXiv, the computer vision field would not advance at anything close to its current speed,” said Zabih. Conferences and journals are both useful venues for presenting and peer reviewing results. But the pace of research is fast, and arXiv provides an invaluable vehicle for rapid research sharing between conference and journal cycles. Plus, while the high bar for acceptance to conferences and journals serves an important purpose, arXiv provides a platform for lesser-known researchers to make their mark. “High profile researchers will always have ways to share their work, say, by being invited to give talks. arXiv levels the playing field,” said Zabih.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/funding&quot;&gt;arXiv recently launched an updated sustainability model&lt;/a&gt;, which distributes arXiv’s operational costs fairly across our dedicated community. This donation was the first Gold Affiliate through this sustainability model and is a continuation of The Computer Vision Foundation’s support, which began in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like earlier donations from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Heising-Simons Foundation, and Google, Inc, this contribution supports arXiv’s critical infrastructure improvements and integration with the scholarly communications landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“arXiv has been operating in maintenance mode for quite some time,” said Eleonora Presani, arXiv’s executive director. “With generous support from organizations like The Computer Vision Foundation, arXiv can innovate for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although we often think of young children as rather selfish, research has shown that babies and toddlers have a surprisingly strong sense of what is fair. At one year old, kids &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/do-kids-have-a-fundamental-sense-of-fairness/&quot;&gt;already expect resources to be divided fairly&lt;/a&gt; and for people to be helpful towards others. By two, they themselves &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/01/toddlers-have-an-instinct-for-fairness-and-generosity/&quot;&gt;tend to distribute resources equally&lt;/a&gt;, and would rather play with a fair adult than an unfair one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But at what point do young kids actually intervene when they see someone else acting fairly or unfairly? According to a series of studies in &lt;em&gt;Cognition&lt;/em&gt;, before they’re even one and a half years old children will reward someone for being fair — though they don’t yet punish unfair behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42566&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team, led by Talee Ziv from the University of Washington, first trained a group of 16-month-olds to use a touch screen to produce audio clips. Touching one side of the screen resulted in negative feedback (e.g. “She was bad”) while touching the other side produced positive feedback (e.g. “She was good”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The kids then saw four video clips, each showing a woman distributing crackers or Lego blocks to two other people. In two of the clips, the “distributor” divided up the resources fairly, but in the other two she gave one person more than the other (a different actor played the role of distributor in each of the four clips). After watching these videos, the toddlers were again shown the faces of the four distributors, and after seeing each one had 60 seconds to touch the screen as many times as they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that when the children saw the fair distributors, they touched the side of the screen that gave positive feedback significantly more often than the side that gave negative feedback. But when they saw the unfair distributors, there was no difference in the number of times they touched each side of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results suggested that the children were “rewarding” the fair actors with positive feedback. But it wasn’t clear that they really grasped the idea that the audio clips would be rewarding to the actor. So to ensure that the kids understood that their actions produced a clear reward or punishment, in a later study the researchers tweaked the methods so that touching one side of the screen produced a video of someone giving the actor a cookie, while touching the other side produced a video of someone taking a cookie away. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once again, the children rewarded the fair distributors by pressing the “give cookie” side of the screen more often than the “take cookie away” side. But they pressed each side of the screen equally when the distributors had acted unfairly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results suggest that toddlers reward those who are acting fairly, adding to the evidence that very young children have a strong sense of what is “right” or normative. But, interestingly, these kids don’t seem to punish those who have been unfair (in fact, the researchers suggest that the children instead tended to avoid making responses towards unfair distributors, as they touched the screen fewer times overall after seeing those who acted unfairly).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed to understand why toddlers don’t punish unfair actors. They might not see the actions as bad enough to warrant any kind of punishment, the team suggests, or could believe that punishment is only done by people in positions of authority. Or maybe the concept of punishment develops later than that of reward. Either way, the team concludes, the results imply that punishment is not simply the flip side of reward, but that the two are unique processes that may develop differently in children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027721002006&quot;&gt;Toddlers’ interventions toward fair and unfair individuals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Elinor McKone admits that as a junior postdoctoral student, she was unable to recognise her other-race senior professor “by anything other than his coat”. McKone was, then, a perpetrator of the “other-race effect” (ORE) — the (well-documented) fact that we are generally poorer at recognising the faces of people of races other than our own. Now at the Australian National University, McKone has led the first formal investigation into how this phenomenon affects everyday social interactions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12508?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; of students of mostly Chinese heritage, who had recently moved to study in Australia, reveals that both being a victim and a perpetrator makes social interactions more difficult. In fact, the students found it to be as big of a hurdle to successful socialising as the language barrier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42556&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 89 students, all from east and south-east Asia, first completed a computer-based memory task, which measured their individual ability to recognise own-race versus other-race faces. Then they answered questions about how hard they had found it to socialise with White people in Australia and how much cultural or language barriers contributed to these difficulties.  They also indicated the extent to which the other-race effect was a barrier to socialising, both in terms of difficulties the students had had in recognising White people and matching their names to their faces, and in terms of their experience of White students or authority figures (such as tutors) confusing them with other Asian people. Finally, the students reported on how upsetting or difficult they found these experiences. (“Asian” and “White” are used here because these are the terms used by the researchers; they were chosen for being in general use by the students.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the other-race effect made a significant contribution to the students’ reported difficulties in socialising with White people. On the objective face recognition test, those who did worse at recognising other-race compared to own-race faces reported greater difficulties socialising. And participants themselves reported that experiences of being a either a victim or perpetrator of the other-race effect contributed equally to difficulties socialising — so struggles in recognising White people and being mis-recognised as another Asian person were both important. In fact, these experiences were perceived as being as important as the language barrier and only moderately less important than cultural differences. “In sum, these results show international students viewed ORE-related factors… as highly relevant factors to understanding their real-world difficulties socialising with White people,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of the 89% of participants who reported a White authority figure in their lives, 81% said they had had at least some experience of being confused by this person with other Asians. This caused distress and difficulty for 14% of this group. However, around half “largely shrugged off being an ORE victim,” the team writes. The reason for the striking variation in reactions isn’t clear. It might be to do with how frequently a person is confused for someone else, the team suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have looked at how the effect impacts court-room testimony, for example, in making an eye-witness more liable to misidentify someone of a race other than their own. But as the team writes, their new work shows that “it causes real-world problems in &lt;em&gt;common everyday situations experienced by all humans&lt;/em&gt;.” (Their italics.) And there are various further potential implications. If people cannot recognise other-race faces, they may choose to socialise more with people of their own race, encouraging segregation. Clearly, much more research is needed to understand the everyday impacts of this effect. And as effective strategies to combat it have so far proved elusive, there’s an urgent need for further study in this area, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12508&quot;&gt;Why the other-race effect matters: Poor recognition of other-race faces impacts everyday social interactions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 Abstract:  The goal of the open access (OA) movement is to help everyone access the scholarly research, not just those who can afford to. However, most studies looking at whether OA has met this goal have focused on whether other scholars are making use of OA research. Few have considered how the broader public, including the news media, uses OA research. This study sought to answer whether the news media mentions OA articles more or less than paywalled articles by looking at articles published from 2010 through 2018 in journals across all four quartiles of the Journal Impact Factor using data obtained through Altmetric.com and the Web of Science. Gold, green and hybrid OA articles all had a positive correlation with the number of news mentions received. News mentions for OA articles did see a dip in 2018, although they remained higher than those for paywalled articles.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;So far I was very fortunate with my scientific long-term mentors and supervisors: both of them are kind, open, creative and stunningly intelligent. I could not wish for more. However, when asked about a role model, I would mention a person that influenced my take on research, during a time when I still was studying physics, probably more than others: Pina Bausch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pina Bausch was a dancer and choreographer who mostly worked in the small town of Wuppertal, Germany, where she developed her own way of modern dance. Her works are creative and inventive in very unexpected ways, and the way she explored body movements as a dancer struck me as surprisingly similar to what I think is “research”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6839&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6839&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;pinabausch&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/pinabausch.png?w=592&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/pinabausch.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/pinabausch.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;592,463&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/pinabausch/&quot; height=&quot;499&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/pinabausch.png?w=592&quot; width=&quot;638&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research in its purest form is the exploration of the unknown, the discovery of what is not yet discovered, without a clear path ahead. The question that I’m working on in the broadest sense, “How does the brain work?”, enters the unknown very quickly as soon as you take the question seriously. How, in general, can we see what cannot be seen yet, how can we find ideas that do not yet exist?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pina Bausch was a master in this art. Her craft was not science or biology but dancing, but I think one can learn some lessons from her. It was typical of her to explore her own movements and to “invent” new movements, like wrist movements or coordinated movements of elbows and the head, or simply a slowed-down or delayed movement of the fingers. In regular life we use a rather limited and predefined combination of motor actions, and it takes some creativity to come up with movements that are unexpected and new but still interesting. One way to find new ways to move would be to consciously become aware of the own patterns and limitations and then try to systematically break those rules. However, Pina Bausch performed this discovery process in a different way. Her research was not guided by intellectual deduction or conclusion, but by her intuition. In 1992, she said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ich weiß nämlich immer, wonach ich suche, aber ich weiß es eher mit meinem Gefühl als mit meinem Kopf.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Because I always know what I’m searching for. But I know it with my heart and with my feeling rather than with my brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This might come over as a bit naive at first glance. Sure, an artist uses her heart, a scientist uses his brain, that sounds more or less normal, doesn’t it? However, when I saw Pina Bausch do this kind of searching, that is, when she danced, I was very impressed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She seemed to rely on her intuition on every single moment of her explorations; and when I heard her talk about it (unfortunately, I’m only aware of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f04Tk1pqQok&quot;&gt;interviews in German&lt;/a&gt; without translation), it was also clear that she did not have and did not need an explanation of what was going on. Most impressively for me, her way of exploring the unknown really struck me as similar to what is going on in a researcher, no matter the subject. What made her such an excellent researcher?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To me, it seems that the prerequisites of her impressive ability are the following: First of all, of course, a deeply engrained knowledge of and skill with her art, together with a honest care about the details. There’s no intuition without experience and knowledge. Second, an openness to whatever random things might happen and to accept them, coming from the outside or her inside. Third, an acceptance of the fact that she doesn’t really know what she’s doing. Or, to put this differently, a certain humility in the face of what is going to happen and what is going on in her own subconsciousness. I believe that these are qualities that also make for a good researcher in science.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also reflects my own experience of doing research (at least partially). Even when I was working with mathematical tools, for example when I was modeling diffusion processes in inhomogeneous media during my diploma thesis, I had the impression that my intuition was always a couple of steps ahead of myself. Often I could see the shape of the mathematical goal ahead of my derivations, and it would take me several days before I could bring it down to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course there are other ways to develop new ideas, and for some problems intuition also fails systematically (maybe complex systems?). And of course there are other kinds of research, for example the gradual optimization of methods, or the development of devices to solve a specific problem, or the broad and systematic screening of candidate genes or materials for a defined purpose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These systematic and step-wise procedures are more predictable than “pure” research, and the grant-based scientific research reinforces this kind of research. In a grant proposal, there are typically a defined number of “aims”. The more clearly defined these aims are, the better the chances of the grant proposal to be accepted. This makes sense. It would be ridiculous to fund a project with loosely defined aims, especially if other, competing proposals have a clear and realistic goal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, this necessary side-effect of grant-based research narrows our perspective on a kind of research that can be more or less clearly described even before doing it. It narrows down also the way how we talk about research and about results. We do not directly encourage young researchers to use and develop their intuition, as if this had nothing to do with the scientific process. In grants and progress reports and talks and papers, we try to use very concise, precise language, sharp and clean as steel (often completed by pieces of superficial math that are supposed to demonstrate precision), not only when describing our methods – but also when describing results and when interpreting the results. This is not bad by itself, but it shapes also the way we think about research, and it can lead to a situation where we internally might reject ideas or results that do not satisfy the desired clarity and cleanliness in a first step. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think that also researchers in “hard” sciences like neuroscience could benefit from a technique that uses intuitive thinking, and at least I have learnt a lot from the way Pina Bausch approached her subject of study using these techniques. Ultimately, understanding in neuroscience should always aim for descriptions in terms of words or math. But the way towards this goal does not need to be guided by these clear ways of thinking alone. From my experience, the power of intuition is only unleashed if we accept that we cannot really understand the process itself. Therefore, I see the humility that Pina Bausch showed towards her own intuitive thought process not simply as a simple virtue of a human being, but rather as a tool and a way of thinking that enables creativity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New work is providing fascinating insights into aphantasia, a condition where you are unable to see images with your mind’s eye. &lt;/strong&gt;There even appears to be a flip side to the condition, hyperphantasia, where mental imagery is particularly powerful. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/08/science/minds-eye-mental-pictures-psychology.html&quot;&gt;Carl Zimmer examines the new findings&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; (and see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/03/bonus-episode-whats-it-like-to-have-no-minds-eye/&quot;&gt;our podcast&lt;/a&gt; on aphantasia from 2019).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42538&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/why-its-difficult-for-children-to-understand-sarcasm-160915&quot;&gt;Penny Paxman explains&lt;/a&gt; why children don’t fully grasp sarcasm until they are around seven to ten years old. &lt;/strong&gt;Understanding why someone is being sarcastic relies on quite sophisticated cognitive processes — not just those directly related to language, but also the ability to empathise and think about another person’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tamer breeds of cattle tend to have smaller brains,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/06/tamer-cow-smaller-brain&quot;&gt;reports Michael Price&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. The researchers think that because humans have selectively bred beef and dairy cows to be calm and gentle, over time the brain areas involved in aggression have shrunk. The work is consistent with other studies finding that domesticated dogs, pigs and other animals have smaller brains that their wild counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurological and psychiatric symptoms are common even in mild cases of COVID-19, a review of studies has found. &lt;/strong&gt;Loss of taste or smell, weakness and fatigue were each reported by around half of those who had COVID-19 but weren’t hospitalised, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2279780-many-people-with-covid-19-have-neurological-or-psychiatric-symptoms/?utm_campaign=RSS%7CNSNS&amp;amp;utm_source=NSNS&amp;amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;amp;utm_content=news&quot;&gt;according to a story&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroscientists think that for our brains to represent the world accurately, a similar pattern of neurons must fire whenever we have the same perceptual experience. &lt;/strong&gt;So a new study has left researchers puzzled, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/06/the-brain-isnt-supposed-to-change-this-much/619145/?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;writes Ed Yong&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic. &lt;/em&gt;The team found that when mice sniffed the same smell over a period of weeks, the group of cells in the smell-identifying region of their brains gradually changed, so that a month later it was almost a completely different set of neurons from that at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, at &lt;em&gt;BBC Worklife&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210608-how-to-train-your-personality-to-re-enter-the-world&quot;&gt;our former editor Christian Jarrett discusses&lt;/a&gt; how you can change your personality to cope with the imminent return to the workplace. &lt;/strong&gt;Also &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/05/18/episode-25-how-to-change-your-personality/&quot;&gt;check out our recent podcast&lt;/a&gt;, in which I discuss the science of personality change with Christian.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/Hendriks-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to our &lt;strong&gt;SDG Editorial Board Members&lt;/strong&gt; blog collection. We are hearing from the Editorial Board Members of the BMC Series journals whose work aligns with achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Here you can find other posts in this collection, grouped with the tag ‘SDG editorial board members‘.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actively advancing the SDGs – an exciting, challenging and rewarding journey  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tod&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12430&quot; height=&quot;170&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/SDG2-300x170.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;ay’s societal challenges are complex. Tackling the complexity requires that researchers with diverse backgrounds actively work together. Transdisciplinary research provides exciting opportunities to unravel the complexity and explore solutions. Over the past two decades, I have been privileged to work at the interface of these challenges – at the global, African and country-level. I have also trained a cadre of professionals in adopting transdisciplinary mindsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research and policy work focuses primarily on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/&quot;&gt;SDG 2&lt;/a&gt; that seeks to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. However, this SDG touches all other SDGs and underpins the human rights fundamental to achieving all other SDGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant challenge in working on SDG2 is the diverse understandings of its components. I have found that the essential starting point is to make sure everyone around the table understands what we are discussing – in meetings with communities, policymakers or researchers. Assuming everyone is on the same page is a monumental mistake. Even in the international domain, SDG2 is often incorrectly labelled ‘ending hunger’ – only one element of SDG2. Hunger is an extreme (acute) form of food insecurity but also includes other outcomes such as malnutrition and the complexities of the coexistence of undernourishment and obesity in poor communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these misconceptions relate to views that food security relates only to production rather than considering the inter-linked core elements of food security: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/3/ca9731en/ca9731en.pdf&quot;&gt;availability, access, nutrition, resilience, agency and sustainability&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, this 1970’s production perspective has changed with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03031853.2018.1479974&quot;&gt;deeper understanding of food insecurity and its causes&lt;/a&gt;. Malnutrition is often understood as undernutrition rather than embracing all forms of malnutrition: undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies (often termed ‘hidden hunger’) and overweight (including obesity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, food security is &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12571-015-0457-6.pdf&quot;&gt;not a static condition&lt;/a&gt;. Households can become more or less food insecure over time or seasons. Simultaneously achieving the four inter-linked elements of the SDG2 is the focus of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/en/food-systems-summit&quot;&gt;September 2021 United Nations Food Systems Summit&lt;/a&gt;. All four elements of SDG2 are outcomes of sustainable food systems but require specific actions to ensure that the elements of food systems work together to deliver on SDG2. The food systems approach provide ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/en/food-systems-summit/action-tracks&quot;&gt;lenses’&lt;/a&gt; to examine the effectiveness of food system components and stakeholders. Food systems approaches can help identify opportunities to address failures and tradeoffs in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of study related to SDG2 is changing rapidly, making research in this field exciting, challenging and rewarding.  Working in this field has led to opportunities to work with diverse international transdisciplinary teams. From these treasured engagements, I have learnt an enormous amount about many topics that touch on, underly and shape research on SDG2. These opportunities have included drafting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.interacademies.org/publication/opportunities-future-research-and-innovation-food-and-nutrition-security-and&quot;&gt;consensus reports&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiNvN2O14zxAhXGiVwKHb5TDu4QFjAAegQIAhAD&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mamopanel.org%2Fresources%2FNutrition%2Freports-and-briefings%2Fnourished-how-africa-can-build-future-free-hunger2%2F&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1Mmaru-77mGAncdaz1WLfB&quot;&gt;regional&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/cfs/cfs-hlpe/hlpe-reports/en/&quot;&gt;international foci&lt;/a&gt; to direct scientific input into international processes such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.48565/scfss2021-wg92&quot;&gt;United Nations Food Systems Summit preparation&lt;/a&gt; to embarking on &lt;a href=&quot;https://sc-fss2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/UNFSS_true_cost_of_food.pdf&quot;&gt;challenging research analysis&lt;/a&gt; with relatively large teams of international experts. My work enabled participation in the drafting of the United Nations High-Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition, which first &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3901e.pdf&quot;&gt;defined food systems in 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through these opportunities, one learns how to share your own knowledge in a way that others outside of your field of expertise can understand while building your own knowledge from the engagement with others. Such engagement requires flexibility in thinking and the willingness to expand your scope of knowledge. It requires a great deal of listening and learning – something that does not come naturally to Professors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are only nine years left before the end of the SDG era (2016 – 2030), we still have so much to learn about how to face, embrace and overcome the complexity of the issues related to SDG2. I believe that the opportunities afforded by the digital connectivity during the COVID pandemic have helped significantly advance our understanding of SDG2 in the context of food systems. The continual engagement by a range of stakeholders with the UN Food Systems Summit preparation has enabled the identification of ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/en/food-systems-summit/news/food-systems-game-changers-reflections&quot;&gt;game changing’&lt;/a&gt; solutions to advance progress on the SDGs. These solutions offer guidance on the future directions for researchers committed to supporting progress on the SDGs and SDG2 in particular. There are also opportunities for researchers to track the implementation and effectiveness of the solutions chosen by food systems stakeholders – albeit countries or the private sector. Stepping up to these opportunities will inform progress towards 2030 and provide the evidence base to inform the subsequent development era (post the SDGs).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For many, moving out of the family home is a rite of passage, a sign that adulthood is just about to begin. Equally, however, there are plenty of reasons why somebody might move back &lt;em&gt;in &lt;/em&gt;with their parents: after a break-up, to save money, for health reasons, or to care for ageing or unwell relatives. Anecdotally, the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have been another reason for such a move, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/11/11/adult-children-move-back-parents-pandemic-costing-425-month/&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/mar/18/ill-cherish-these-moments-how-covid-has-swelled-the-boomerang-generation&quot;&gt;proliferating&lt;/a&gt; on children once more living with their parents and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/adult-children-parents-home-pandemic/2021/01/18/3e55ef70-5696-11eb-a817-e5e7f8a406d6_story.html&quot;&gt;offering advice&lt;/a&gt; on how to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But how do such “boomerang kids” frame their decision to move back home, and how do they ensure it goes well? A &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/21676968211012584&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Emerging Adulthood&lt;/em&gt; finds four strategies young people use to make the transition back into the family home as positive as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42532&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were 31 young adults, aged between 18 and 35, who had moved back into the family home. Researchers interviewed the participants on their experiences, before conducting an analysis of the data to pull out the key themes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The analysis found an overarching concern for boomerang kids: framing their move as an “investment in the future” rather than something to be ashamed of. Multiple participants acknowledged the stigma of moving back home, with one expressing that it “made me feel insecure in my success… that others may judge me for it”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This stigma, however, was frequently turned on its head and reframed as a positive decision for the future: participants mentioned the financial security it had given them, the increased likelihood of returning to university or graduate school due to this security, and the opportunity to get advice and support from parents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also pulled out four communication strategies that participants used to navigate the move back home in a way that both reduced the experience of stigma and allowed them to have adult relationships with their parents. The first was to develop clear expectations with their parents in order to assert boundaries and set out what living together would look like in reality. Those discussions revolved around topics like curfews, meal times, chores, and other responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, all participants saw contributions to the household as an important factor in destigmatising the move back home and making sure relationships worked well. These contributions included cooking, running errands, paying rent and doing other practical tasks, as well as making emotional contributions by listening to parents and sharing feelings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants also indicated that it was important to make sure that parents knew the move was only temporary, and in some cases they shared a specific timeline. One participant noted the importance of “having a next step”: “I told them it would be a two year commitment and we’re pretty much on track for that.” This also helped with cultural stigma and shame: seeing the move as a time-bound transition period helped participants accept their move and frame it as a logical step.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, participants stressed that engaging in “mature, responsible, adult behaviour” was key: waking up early, setting and keeping to routines and responsibilities, and functioning independently. For some, this stopped them from reverting back to their “child identity” when living at home, and established an adult relationship with parents that differed in dynamic from child or teen years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although family relationships will clearly differ from unit to unit, particularly when factoring in different geographies and cultural expectations, overall the interviews provide good insight not only into the reality of moving home, but into how to actually navigate it as well. Future research could look more closely at the &lt;em&gt;differences&lt;/em&gt; in people’s experiences, and how this relates to personality type, background, and other individual factors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/21676968211012584&quot;&gt;A Normative Approach to Understanding How “Boomerang Kids” Communicatively Negotiate Moving Back Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2021-06-09T18:36:12+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Michael Schmuker will talk about a paper &quot;Feed-Forward and Noise-Tolerant Detection of Feature Homogeneity in Spiking Networks with a Latency Code&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In studies of the visual system as well as in computer vision, the
focus is often on contrast edges. However, the primate visual system
contains a large number of cells that are insensitive to spatial
contrast and, instead, respond to uniform homogeneous illumination of
their visual field. The purpose of this information remains unclear.
Here, we propose a mechanism that detects feature homogeneity in
visual areas, based on latency coding and spike time coincidence, in a
purely feedforward and therefore rapid manner. We demonstrate how
homogeneity information can interact with information on contrast
edges to potentially support rapid image segmentation. Furthermore, we
analyze how neuronal crosstalk (noise) affects the mechanism's
performance. We show that the detrimental effects of crosstalk can be
partly mitigated through delayed feed-forward inhibition that shapes
bi-phasic postsynaptic events. The delay of the feed-forward
inhibition allows effectively controlling the size of the temporal
integration window and, thereby, the coincidence threshold. The
proposed model is based on single-spike latency codes in a purely
feed-forward architecture that supports low-latency processing, making
it an attractive scheme of computation in spiking neuronal networks
where rapid responses and low spike counts are desired.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;For the past few months, I’ve been working on a machine learning research project, which I just submitted to NeurIPS. The scale is, all things considered, fairly small: the output limited to one paper and a handful of figures. Yet, I still needed to distribute the work along a mini-cluster in the cloud, keep track of thousands of different experiments, track key performance metrics over time, and integrate a half-dozen datasets and a dozen models. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At that scale, it’s pretty easy to shoot yourself in the foot: introduce a data loading error that invalidates your results, forget to keep track of which parameters you used for which experiment you ran months ago, have a figure that’s not easily reproducible because the steps to reproduce the figure have been lost through the sands of time, etc. &lt;a href=&quot;https://paperswithcode.com/trends&quot;&gt;25% of papers in machine learning actually publish their code&lt;/a&gt;, and I have a feeling that a big chunk of the other 75% is because people hesitate to share their messy creations, or the code is so brittle that it self-destroys as soon as you see it and they don’t want to support it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s the stack that I used for this project, the reason I took some decisions, and some lessons I learned. I think that the organization I show here is appropriate for small research teams like academic labs and early-stage startups. Some of this is a little pedestrian, but I hope you learn a thing or two. Let me know about your experiences in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Decision points&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Local vs. cloud&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/&quot;&gt;Full Stack Deep Learning&lt;/a&gt; class from Berkeley is a good place to learn how to organize deep learning projects. I had originally intended to go all-in on cloud infra to run models and analyze data. The class makes a solid argument that it ends being cheaper to build your own machine for local testing, then scale on the cloud as needed. I had a several years old deep learning rig with a 1080 Titan lying around, so I ended up wiping the drive and installing Ubuntu 20 on it for local bleeding edge development. I would then push the code to github when the code was ready to be scaled and run on cloud infra. Having a local dev machine doesn’t mean you’re locked to that place: you can still set up remote ssh access, but given that it was winter and we were on lockdown I never had a reason to do it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I had spent far too many afternoons figuring out (and yelling at and crying about) kubernetes on Google Cloud last year, so for this project I decided to avoid managing cloud infra by using a managed on-demand service. I wanted a central server where I could submit a batch job and it would provision the right machine to run the job and store the results somewhere in the cloud. Importantly, I wanted it set up in a way that I wouldn’t have to pay for a central server, only for the workers. I ended up using &lt;strong&gt;paperspace gradient&lt;/strong&gt; for this purpose, which at the time, had cheap prices for GPU instances, and offered a straightforward product called &lt;em&gt;experiments&lt;/em&gt; which was meant for exactly the purpose I wanted. This setup worked great for the first 3 months, but then Gradient changed their product to focus on a more turnkey solution, and from that point on the original product stopped working properly (multiple jobs would hang, you couldn’t find jobs from the interface, customer support was abysmal). Next time, I will try &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/batch/&quot;&gt;AWS Batch&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps I will dip my toe into SageMaker to get access to a cloud jupyter notebook for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Code organization&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One unexpected advantage of using this hybrid local/cloud setup is that it immediately imposed a certain discipline on the project: gradient runs your code inside a &lt;strong&gt;docker&lt;/strong&gt; container, so you have to have a docker container ready, hence you are documenting your dependencies as you go along. I used the Pytorch docker container base and kept adding dependencies as needed, and used dockerhub to build the containers in the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This setup also imposes a workflow that focuses on creating batch jobs as Python scripts as opposed to jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks are great for analysis, but building models in jupyter notebook is a bad idea – you pollute your global namespace, you risk running cells out of order, the editor has poor introspection so won’t tell you if you reference a variable that doesn’t exist following a long script, etc. I much prefer writing models and batch scripts in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;VSCode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, using &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&quot;&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as an autoformatter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re used to a jupyter-notebook-based workflow, you’re probably used to writing small snippets of code, testing them in the cell on a handful of inputs, then lifting the code to a function which then you can integrate into the larger notebook narrative. With a batch-based workflow you lose this fast feedback process. The key to getting back that productivity – and then some – is to switch to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/testing.html&quot;&gt;test-driven development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Rather than informally testing snippets of your code in jupyter notebook, you create a separate test suite that calls the functions in your Python script and checks that their output is as expected. This forces you to write reasonably clean code with small functions that don’t have a lot of side effects. In practice, I didn’t aim for 100% code coverage, but instead focused on tests for data loaders and models. Testable code is also much easier to refactor, because you can easily see if you broke you code by re-running the test suite. Each test should only take a few milliseconds to run.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I enabled &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/about-continuous-integration&quot;&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt; (CI)&lt;/strong&gt; in the Github repo to run my pytest suite via nose2 every time I pushed code. Unfortunately, a lot of that code depended on having GPU access on Github, which would have become expensive, so I didn’t end up using it. It does look like it’s possible to run test suites on a GPU-enabled machine via &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/drelleobrien/how-to-use-github-actions-with-your-gpu-4f1g&quot;&gt;nvidia-docker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I used an ad-hoc project folder structure inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/index.html&quot;&gt;PyRSE&lt;/a&gt;. Elizabeth DuPre told me about cookiecutter, which allows one to create projects from templates. &lt;a href=&quot;https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/&quot;&gt;I ended up using the &lt;strong&gt;datascience cookiecutter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a subset of the project, and generally I liked it (although it is a bit too nested for my taste).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;TF vs. PyTorch&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ve used TF in the past, but I decided to use &lt;strong&gt;PyTorch&lt;/strong&gt; this round, since a lot of the models I wanted to test were released in PyTorch. The PyTorch documentation is excellent. A surprising chunk of my codebase ended up being training loops, so for next time I will consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/&quot;&gt;PyTorch Lightning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Storing results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One thing I never really spent time thinking about in grad school is how to store results. I have folders and folders in an old DropBox that are filled to the brim with mat files with long names from gosh knows what experiment. The problem with such ad hoc results storage is that you don’t know how the results were generated, because the results and the code are not linked. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you’d like to store results in a centralized location with the following features:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;each result comes with metadata about how the result was generated (command line parameters, git hash, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you can safely delete stale results&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you can query results to find the subet which you’re interested in&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you can visualize metadata about the results in graphical form (dashboard)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You could implement these functionalities yourself, for example with a local mongo database instance to store the results, and a dashboard of your creation, but I ended up instead using &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wandb.ai/&quot;&gt;Weights and Biases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (wandb). This turned out to be a great idea, highly recommended. In your code, you push your results along with metadata to their server using a simple library that you can pip install. The library takes care of adding the git hash to the payload so you know what code generated the result. You can also use the libary to send and store weights, images, checkpoints, etc. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7695&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7695&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-4&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;3026,1560&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-4-3/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-4.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Wandb dashboard&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You get a fully customizable dashboard built on vega-lite to keep track of your results. To retrieve your results, you use mongodb queries, so you can filter results by whatever property you desire. To have meaningful properties to query, I specify command line arguments to my training scripts via &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html&quot;&gt;argparse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, for instance number of filters, learning rate, epochs, etc. Then I send the argparse arguments to wandb when I save my results. That way I can easily filter by learning rate, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Locally, I do still use &lt;strong&gt;tensorboard&lt;/strong&gt; to babysit my networks, especially with a new network when it’s not clear whether the training will converge or not. I find that tensorboard is good to diagnose one model, but it’s not great to keep track of multiple models (say, more than 5) – pretty soon all you see is a mess of training curves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Analyzing results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;strong&gt;jupyterlab&lt;/strong&gt; locally to analyze my results. One thing that I don’t like about jupyter notebooks is that it doesn’t play well with git – the diffs are meaningless. I will try out &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext&quot;&gt;jupytext&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows to write jupyter notebooks as plain text. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Mistakes I made&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I accumulated a lot of technical debt around a seemingly innocuous decision about data storage. I downloaded brain data in ad hoc formats from multiple public sources (crcns), and I originally wrote a PyTorch data loader for each data source. That meant that for every new brain dataset I wanted to integrate, I would write a new data loader, which would take care of filtering out bad records, splitting the data into train and test set, and transforming it into the format that PyTorch expected. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That worked fine for the first 2 or 3 datasets, but pretty soon it became a liability. The ad-hoc formats were not always designed for rapid loading – some datasets were really slow to load because they used small block sizes in hdf5. Other datasets needed some manual curation. What I needed is an intermediate format – I would preprocess the datasets into the intermediate format once, and then load the intermediate format in the data loaders. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I should have done&lt;/strong&gt; is have one true intermediate format – e.g. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nwb.org/&quot;&gt;NWB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – I should also have decided train/test splits during the preprocessing. The data needed to be in a &lt;strong&gt;FAIR&lt;/strong&gt; format in the intermediate stage – it needed, especially to be interopable. What I ended up doing is having a bunch of ad hoc intermediate formats – I would minimally preprocess the data and save it in a format parallel to the original one. Ultimately, that meant having to make a lot of micro decisions (e.g. how do I specify the train/test splits – two datasets, or one dataset and two sets of indices?) that I made inconsistently across datasets, and it became a mess that I never bothered fixing. My test suite for loaders ballooned as I had to cover for corner cases for every loader. Doing it over again, I would find settle on one true intermediate format.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I experimented a bit with using &lt;strong&gt;make&lt;/strong&gt; to create the intermediate format, and I think it’s a great solution for this use case. make will create intermediate results if they don’t exist but won’t try to recreate them if they’re already there; an ideal solution to manage complex pipelines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Releasing code and models&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I didn’t really think much about making the code easy to run for others, but when it came time to release it (for reviewers), it only took me about a half day to clean up the codebase and write docs. The code was already logically organized, the dependencies documented, most everything ran automatically with bash scripts, so all in all it was much less trouble to release than a typical project I would have undertook in grad school. That being said, I would like to release the model in an easy-to-use way. It’s unfortunate that huggingface models are restricted to transformer models, that would have been ideal. I was recently made aware of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/replicate/cog&quot;&gt;cog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which aims to make model releases easy, complete with docker environment and downloadable weights. The weights themselves can be stored on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://figshare.com/&quot;&gt;figshare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (free bandwidth!)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Keep/change/try&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-table&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Keep&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Change&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Try (more)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pytorch&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Paperspace -&amp;gt; AWS batch&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Jupytext&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;wandb&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ad hoc intermediate format -&amp;gt; NWB&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Make&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mixed local/cloud development&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Google Cloud Storage -&amp;gt; S3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Data science cookie cutter&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;vscode&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;PyTorch Lightning&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Test-driven development&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;cog&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Black&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;SageMaker&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Docker&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Physically attractive people are routinely judged to be “superior” in other ways — to be more trustworthy, for example, and honest, and intelligent. However, evidence for the unwarranted “attractiveness halo” effect has tended to come from studies that have involved snap-judgements with no feedback or repercussions for the people doing the judging. Gayathri Pandey and Vivian Zayas at Cornell University, US, wanted to explore how this bias plays out in the longer term, when contradicted by actual data. If, say, we’re given information that an attractive investor is actually losing us money, while an unattractive investor is securing profits, surely we’ll quickly drop that bias in relation to these individual people at least? Alarmingly, the pair’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12495?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Psychology&lt;/em&gt; suggests not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42524&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an initial study, 91 students were each shown four photos of purported “financial partners” (all of the same gender). Two of the composite faces had independently been rated as attractive and two as unattractive. The students were given a hypothetical $2000 and told to make as much money as possible. Across 50 trials with all male partners and another 50 with all female partners, they had to click on a face to choose one with whom to invest the money, and each time, they got feedback as to whether they’d lost or gained money.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before they started, the students were informed that some of the partners would be more helpful than others. They were also encouraged to try them all, to find out which were better and which worse. What they were not told was that there were in fact two equally disadvantageous partners (who delivered some relatively large immediate gains but smaller long-term profits or even long-term losses) — one attractive and one unattractive — and two advantageous partners (who conferred better long-term profits), again, one attractive and one not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As expected, the students started out favouring the attractive partners. But even after receiving 50 trials’ worth of feedback about the performance of each individual, they were still swayed by attractiveness. In fact, they preferred the attractive-&lt;em&gt;disadvantageous&lt;/em&gt; partner over the unattractive-&lt;em&gt;advantageous &lt;/em&gt;partner. They also reported finding the attractive partners more helpful. (There was some evidence of improved performance in the second block of trials, though the team’s analysis suggests that this reflected better use of the feedback, rather than getting significantly better at discounting attractiveness.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps 50 trials weren’t enough for the participants to accurately discriminate between helpful vs unhelpful partners, and discount attractiveness, the researchers reasoned. So they ran another experiment, this time with 135 participants who each completed 100 trials (with either all male or all female partners).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results were different — but not drastically so. As the participants progressed through the 100 rounds of feedback, they did come to show a preference for the advantageous partners. However, after suffering a loss, they were still quicker to return to an attractive vs unattractive partner, and by the end, the attractive-disadvantageous partner was still &lt;em&gt;as popular&lt;/em&gt; a choice as the unattractive-advantageous one. “Even with more opportunity to learn about partners’ profitability, time did not appreciably moderate the effect of attractiveness,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The participants were asked afterwards about how trustworthy they perceived the four partners to be. The attractive two were clearly favoured. In fact, the researchers’ analysis suggests that a perceived association between attractiveness and trustworthiness explained the results — we seem to use attractiveness as a signal of trustworthiness, and rely on it, even in the face of financial losses (albeit hypothetical ones).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s possible of course that with more trials, which could provide a clearer picture of trends in financial gains and losses, the attractiveness bias would have been eliminated. Only further research will tell. And as the researchers themselves note, a study that involved American college students, just White faces and hypothetical rather than real money is only a starting point for research in this area, rather than the final word. However, the new work certainly does suggest that the attractiveness halo colours our judgements, at a cost to ourselves, for far longer than might have been assumed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12495?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;What is a face worth? Facial attractiveness biases experience-based monetary decision-making&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 A lab leak theory of the COVID-19 origins has enough circumstantial evidence and historical basis to support the urgent need for an independent and unbiased investigation. But until recently, scientists dismissed lab leak as a conspiracy theory. In public at least.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The University of Cape Town (UCT) in South Africa is in a prime location to conduct oceanographic research and features a wealth of scientific expertise. However, as in many institutions, the pool of oceanographic researchers can be quite homogenous. UCT researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://katyealtieri.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Katye Altieri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Fawcett&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sarah Fawcett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maris.uct.ac.za/ma-re/members/academic/ansorge&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Isabelle Ansorge&lt;/a&gt; realized that while the academic staff in the Department of Oceanography at UCT is comprised of ~50% womxn, it is 100% white. Furthermore, in 2019, amongst postgraduates in the department, there were only 12 Black African and Coloured South African womxn out of 73 students. The barriers that prevent higher representation of Black womxn in oceanography and climate science are numerous and include financial restrictions and lack of resources or training opportunities. The feeling of ‘otherness’ can also prevent Black womxn from feeling like a part of the research community. Altieri says that she and her colleagues saw an opportunity to create “a dedicated programme that offers field work preparation, mentorship and support for black womxn so they can become future leaders of oceanography in South Africa and the global south”. The three womxn joined forces with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saeon.ac.za/enewsleter-archives/2011/february2011/doc05&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Juliet Hermes&lt;/a&gt; from the South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON), and they decided to apply for a grant from the Advancing Womxn initiative, created by UCT Vice-Chancellor Professor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamokgethi_Phakeng&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mamokgethi Phakeng.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result is &lt;a href=&quot;https://oceanwomxn.co.za/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ocean Womxn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a program funded for an 5 year initial period, that aims to remove barriers and provide support for Black womxn in oceanography. In the first year, 5 womxn joined the program, with 2 more following in 2021. The Fellows receive comprehensive support – this includes financial cover for the duration of their degree, relocation costs, field gear budget and a laptop. They also have sea-going opportunities, such as SEAmester cruises, where they can develop lab skills and receive hands-on experience. Additionally, they are offered the option of swimming, boating and scuba lessons. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS ONE recently spoke with some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oceanwomxn.co.za/cohort-2020&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ocean Womxn Fellows&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about the program and how it has impacted their journey as early career oceanographers. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Doctoral training programs and fellowships often provide valuable resources and opportunities for PhD candidates. What opportunities have you had as an Ocean Womxn Fellow that you might not have otherwise had as a general PhD student? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith:&lt;/strong&gt; I would definitely say the emotional and moral support by being in a cohort. Also, the mentor sessions with other women and role models in STEM fields. An added opportunity is definitely the exposure that we get on social media and all over for changing the landscape for black womxn in Oceanography. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kolisa:&lt;/strong&gt; My most memorable and unique opportunities that I am receiving through Ocean Womxn are networking with influential women in the world of STEM. Every month we have visiting mentors ranging from women Professors to women PhD candidates who are making waves in their industries and fields of expertise. This is unique to Ocean Womxn as no other fellowship does this in our department. From these face-to-face interactions we get to ask whatever questions we want answered by the invited mentor. This has largely enriched not just my thinking, but I have formed relationships with some of our guests and have been recommended for opportunities by some.&lt;em&gt;  &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Researchers from under-represented groups/communities often experience a “burden of service”, whereby they are asked to do more outreach and engagement activities than their colleagues. This can take time away from doing actual research. Have you ever previously experienced this, and how has the Ocean Womxn program helped you to avoid being in this situation? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith:&lt;/strong&gt; For me the outreach and engagement activities are not a “burden of service”, but rather an act of love and kindness to reach out to other under-represented groups. The support that I experienced through the Ocean Womxn program inspired me to support other young womxn in STEM research fields. I got involved in the Project Kuongoza Mentorship program as a mentor to mentees across Africa and am now “serving” my continent outside the borders of the country! I believe that you need to have a balance in life and sharing about your experiences in research should be seen as part of enriching your life. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kolisa: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes, I have experienced this. More so because I am a well-known science communicator and so in addition to having the responsibility of “burden of service” I have the responsibility to “teach” science to the masses. Ocean Womxn has enhanced this and for me it really is not a burden but a privilege. I see it as a privilege because I get to be an underrepresented group representative doing the service so well, encouraging others to follow in my footsteps and see that it is possible. It is key for me to be this type of scientist because I did not have this as I grew up in a world where I had no black women ocean scientists to look up to. Ocean Womxn has magnified my role as a role model in not just ocean sciences but in science at large. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; What is the most memorable fieldwork or laboratory experience you have had so far? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith:&lt;/strong&gt; I was involved in the First European-South African Transmission Experiment which was an international collaboration between Germany, Netherlands, Norway, and South Africa. It was a huge challenge and honour for me to be responsible for the data acquisition, analysis, storage, and maintenance of the aerosol equipment. It also led to me doing my PhD! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kolisa:&lt;/strong&gt; My most memorable fieldwork to date is being part of the Prince Edward Island sampling expedition for my PhD. On the expedition we sailed to the subantarctic Southern Ocean on the SA Agulhas II which is South Africa’s research vessel. I spent about 2 and half months in the middle of the ocean living though sea storms and calm waters. It was my first experience out that far into the open ocean. I returned to land as a new woman. I was transformed mentally and had this urge to change the world with my science and I believe that is exactly what I am currently doing. I wanted to make academia and science inclusive, especially for black women! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Your research focuses on understanding the impacts of climate change. How did you become interested in this field?  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith:&lt;/strong&gt; My research on atmospheric aerosols, and more specifically sea spray aerosols, seeks to address the uncertainty about the drivers of climate change. As sea spray aerosols occur naturally in the atmosphere, it can be used as a proxy for pre-industrial conditions and to determine how anthropogenic activities contributed to climate change. I am a Physicist and was involved in characterizing atmospheric effects over the ocean on visual and infrared cameras, when it became apparent that aerosols (microscopic particles) play a huge role in the atmosphere. I then decided to do my PhD atmospheric aerosols to improve the understanding and inputs of aerosols to prediction models of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kolisa: &lt;/strong&gt;Our planet is changing as we know it and our role as scientists is key in uncovering the shifts. As science majors we always heard, read about, and were constantly reminded of global warming which leads to climate change. This sparks interest in many of us to want to uncover and dissect the intricacies of how this happens, how it affects our planet and what we need to do to mitigate it. Therefore, my interests I can say were sparked long before I even knew I would take my research focuses this far into academia. I wanted to be one of the first and few black women scientists from Africa who are part of this global research to understand our planet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; More and more researchers are committing to the mission of Open Science: to making the entire research process openly accessible, transparent, and reproducible. Examples of this include publishing in open access journals, preregistering research plans, publishing protocols, as well as sharing data and code. What are your thoughts on Open Science and how do you feel this kind of improved transparency, accessibility and equity impacts scientific research? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith:&lt;/strong&gt; I am all for Open Science! It was such a relief when articles that were previously behind the paywall became available due to the pandemic. I think that scientific research will now reach higher heights and swifter turnarounds with more diverse collaborations. The Covid-19 vaccine rollouts is a sterling example of how the “openness” of scientific science can contribute to quicker implementations and finding solutions for all. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kolisa:&lt;/strong&gt; I personally have chosen the path of science communication to merge with my research because I support open science. Open science starts with transparency, inclusivity and being accommodative. When our science is openly accessible and well understood we achieve more with our discoveries. The aim of us doing science is to understand how systems work and report on those. These reports are in forms of difficult journal papers that take a lot to understand. I believe that we need to evolve with the times and make our science open and easily understandable by anyone who reads our findings and recommendations. How will the world improve, and people be educated if we do not articulate ourselves strategically to be open and transparent about our data, our research plans and our publishing and communication? &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having a new baby is never easy: it’s difficult to manage the stress of birth, sleepless nights, and juggling of childcare and domestic responsibilities, especially for first-time parents. Some also experience postnatal depression, which is estimated to affect 23% of women in Europe after the birth of a child (men also experience postnatal depression, though the numbers are not so clear).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add to new parenting the impact of lockdown, and that figure could rise sharply, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648002/full&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt; suggests. Working with women with babies aged six months or younger in the UK during the first COVID-19 lockdown, UCL’s Sarah Myers and Emily H. Emmott found that almost half met the threshold for postnatal depression — double the average European rates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42503&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were 162 London-based women aged between 19 and 47 years old; half were first-time mothers, while the other half had up to three other children. Women first filled in a survey which measured symptoms of postnatal depression, then shared their own personal social networks, listing up to 25 people and explaining who they were and what the relationship was.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After sharing this information, participants also reported who in this network they had seen in person and who they had chatted with on the phone, via video call, or by text or WhatsApp over the last few weeks. Contacts included family, old friends, colleagues and so-called “mummy friends” — non-family female friends who also had children of the same age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results showed high levels of depressive symptoms among the new mothers, with 47.5% reporting symptoms that met the threshold of diagnosis of postnatal depression (34.6% of the group reported particularly high levels of symptoms).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In terms of social networks, participants (like many non-parents) saw few people during the weeks leading up to the survey. On average, women had seen one family member, three other general friends, and no “mummy friends”, though they were speaking to many different social contacts via social media, phone call or text. Many women were going without support from family members, however — 47.5% had seen no relatives at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Social contact was also linked to depressive symptoms: the more social contacts participants saw in person, the less likely they were to report symptoms of postnatal depression, suggesting a link between social isolation and depression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also explored the experience of new parenthood during lockdown through open-ended questions about how the pandemic had affected mothers’ self-esteem and their relationships with their babies. Some mothers felt positively about lockdown, stating that it had given them more quality time with their baby and an increase in time partners were home and able to help with childcare. “It has been a great help having my partner home every day as it means most days I can get at least an hour to myself which I use to exercise or catch up on sleep,” one woman wrote. “Also I think it has been an amazing positive on my partner’s ability to build a bond with the baby and co-parent.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, in concordance with the high levels of depressive symptoms, other mothers struggled. Some felt a “constant burden” of parenting (“I think lockdown has made me feel like I’m not a person in my own right anymore, just a mum”), while others pointed to the relative inadequacy of online support. One woman pointed to the many video calls and chats she had during this period — but noted that the physical isolation of lockdown led to a lack of practical advice and support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, others saw lockdown as a time of “lost opportunities”. “You’re only a first time mum once, and I was really looking forward to this time and making new mum friends,” one woman wrote. “I think I am most sad about missing out on that.” Others pointed to worries about development — concerns about whether children would recognise family members having only met them on FaceTime, missing physical and mental milestones, and lack of play with other children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team points to two key insights: firstly, that it “takes a village” to raise a child, with social networks crucial to supporting both parents and babies in the time after birth; and secondly, that the impact of COVID-19 on new parents should be considered in healthcare interventions, with key focus on face-to-face, rather than digital, support from health and social care services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study highlights the unique (and incredibly stressful) circumstances into which new parents were thrust during the COVID-19 pandemic — and now that lockdown has eased, the results suggest, it may be an opportune time to reach out to new parents in your own social networks.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remote focusing is widely used in 3D two-photon microscopy and 3D photostimulation because it enables fast axial scanning without moving the objective lens or specimen. However, due to the design constraints of microscope optics, remote focus units are often located in non-telecentric positions in the optical path, leading to significant depth-dependent 3D field distortions in the imaging volume. To address this limitation, we characterized 3D field distortions arising from non-telecentric remote focusing and present a method for distortion precompensation. We demonstrate its applicability for a 3D two-photon microscope that uses an acousto-optic lens (AOL) for remote focusing and scanning. We show that the distortion precompensation method improves the pointing precision of the AOL microscope to &amp;lt; 0.5 µm throughout the 400 × 400 × 400 µm imaging volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory neurons orchestrate the activity of excitatory neurons and play key roles in circuit function. Although individual interneurons have been studied extensively, little is known about their properties at the population level. Using random-access 3D two-photon microscopy, we imaged local populations of cerebellar Golgi cells (GoCs), which deliver inhibition to granule cells. We show that population activity is organized into multiple modes during spontaneous behaviors. A slow, network-wide common modulation of GoC activity correlates with the level of whisking and locomotion, while faster (&amp;lt;1 s) differential population activity, arising from spatially mixed heterogeneous GoC responses, encodes more precise information. A biologically detailed GoC circuit model reproduced the common population mode and the dimensionality observed experimentally, but these properties disappeared when electrical coupling was removed. Our results establish that local GoC circuits exhibit multidimensional activity patterns that could be used for inhibition-mediated adaptive gain control and spatiotemporal patterning of downstream granule cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where were you at 8am two Tuesdays ago? If it’s a little tricky to recall, what if I presented you with a map with four location flags to choose from, each about 3-4 km apart, with one marking your actual location on that time and date?  Are you confident that you’d pick the right one?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; confident, the good news from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620980752&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; is that you’re more likely to be right than if you’re not too sure. The bad news is that when a group of students in Melbourne, Australia was tested in this way, they picked the wrong location 36% of the time. The study shows that this type of memory is pretty fallible — and yet it’s the type, of course, that’s needed for a criminal alibi. Failures in recalling where you were have no doubt contributed to serious miscarriages of justice, write Elizabeth Laliberte at the University of Melbourne and her colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42494&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 51 students all downloaded onto their phones an app that had been developed by two of the researchers. Over a four week period, this app continuously tracked their movement and orientation, and also took GPS location and audio snapshots every ten minutes. Software stripped any speech from these audio files, but preserved background noise, such as birdsong or building work. (The app was designed to keep raw participant data confidential from even the researchers, and the participants were able to pause data collection for periods.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After a week’s delay, the participants were tested, again via the app. For each of 72 trials, they had to pick where they were on a specific time and date from four markers on a Google map. (They were able to zoom in and out and pan as they pleased). One of these markers represented the correct location, and the other three represented places they’d been on other occasions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team’s analysis revealed that, as a group, the students were correct only about two-thirds of the time. Accuracy did increase with confidence, a finding that supports the idea that (under certain circumstances) &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/08/public-belief-in-memory-myths-not-actually-that-widespread-study-argues/&quot;&gt;greater confidence is linked to better memory&lt;/a&gt;. But the far from perfect performance of these university students, with presumably fairly regular schedules, doesn’t bode well for the rest of us — especially people without regular office hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team highlights the case of American man Ronald Cotton, who in 1985 was convicted on charges of rape and burglary and sentenced to life plus 50 years in prison. Ten years after the conviction, DNA evidence exonerated him. Cotton’s initial defence had not been helped when his alibi had been shown to be false. “Rather than report where he’d been at the time of the crime, Cotton mistakenly recalled where he had been the week before. The error probably contributed significantly to his wrongful conviction,” the researchers write.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team’s analysis suggests that this error is relatively common: choosing a “right-day, wrong-week” location accounted for 19% of their participants’ errors. Participants also frequently chose a location that matched the stipulated hour but got the day wrong — this error accounted for 8% of the mistakes. (They also sometimes picked an incorrect location in which they had made similar patterns of movement or where the background sounds were similar to the correct location — though these errors were less common). “Both of these figures are well above chance rates and suggest that the error that Ronald Cotton made might be quite common,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the findings could have practical, legal applications. Knowing just how fallible this type of alibi memory is — and understanding the most common errors that people make — could help lawyers to ask the right questions of defendants and witnesses, to try to get closer to the truth of where someone really was at a certain time.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there are more general implications for understanding memory, and for the way that memory research is done. Experiments are often lab-based, raising questions about real-world applicability. Passive, unobtrusive, privacy-conscious monitoring technologies like this new app could be used to gather and analyse all kinds of real-world data. As the researchers write, “We are now able to capture the ground truth of people’s lives and to test their ability to retain those events.” And this, they hope, could change how a good deal of memory research is done.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620980752&quot;&gt;The Fallacy of an Airtight Alibi: Understanding Human Memory for “Where” Using Experience Sampling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 Tips for making open access books

We look at six different ways that academic authors at Leiden University have found to make their books open access, and pass on their tips.

More and more academic books are published as Open Access (OA) making them freely available to read without any payment being necessary. The Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) already includes more than 42,000 peer-reviewed OA books from around 500 publishers worldwide. These books are integrated into most library catalogues. Research funders increasingly demand that output produced as a result of their funding, and which is published in books, should be published as OA. It is expected that in the future, more and more academics will publish their book OA as a lot of publishers are willing to publish books immediately OA.

In this blog post the Open Access Team from the Centre for Digital Scholarship, Leiden University Libraries, interviewed some Leiden academics about how they went about publishing their books OA. These interviews show what you can do to publish a book OA, and also how you can make a book that is already published accessible by open access. The examples are in no particular order.</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/PPI_Picscout_OAFI-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think of patients as naïve when seeking help and support, then you are seeing only one part of the picture. Increasingly in the past decade, patients are moving from being “users and choosers” to “makers and shapers”, thus challenging the classic caregiver paradigm. In the paternalistic model of medicine, health professionals appear like parents who impart the best treatment to patients without seeking their opinions in the process. However, owing to an increase in the literacy of patients and moral concerns of the patients’ “right to know”, progress is being made in recognizing the importance of patients’ values and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients live with their conditions every day and are the experts of them. This knowledge should be welcomed and valued throughout the process of care, as well as in the design and implementation of research studies by engaging patients in science. Patients with a scientific background, patients with chronic diseases that are experts of their condition, and those who have recovered from disease may be able to support others in dealing with their disease as well as researchers in the development and design of clinical studies. Knowing what patients want and how they want it is essential to improving the effectiveness of clinical research and consequent societal benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients live with their conditions every day and are the experts of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-12411&quot; height=&quot;553&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/shutterstock_600015697844.jpg&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What exactly is Patient and Public Involvement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Patient and public involvement (PPI) is essentially the research being carried out by researchers alongside members of the public rather than to, about, or for them. Patients have acquired decision-making power through the change of the medical and social paradigm and becoming more active at the time of seeking information around therapeutic options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent developments require investigators to involve the public as part of any prospective reseach and subsequently inform about study’s results. That is if they wish to successfully obtain research funding. Certain types of health research, such as participatory action studies with qualitative methods, mixed-methods studies, validation of questionnaires, Delphi studies, and development of clinical practice guidelines, actively encourage or necessitate patient involvement. On the other side, original research or literature reviews rarely involve patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the era of social media and enhanced connectivity, patients are coming together and patients’ organizations are becoming a reality. This can facilitate support and understanding or, importantly recognize the feelings of being a person suffering from a disease. Patients’ organizations recognize the willingness of patients with a severe chronic condition, such as osteoarthritis, to be involved in public health programs, clinical research, and trials. These partners continuously seek information to be up to date on everything related to their daily life struggles: the disease and its symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can publishers advance public engagement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What science is doing for me? Or How can I contribute with my insights? are two frequent questions in the mind of patients. Still, answering this can be complex as verifying scientific data and accessing the latest publications is challenging for most lay people. Science does not often speak a patient-friendly language, and partner organizations are working to bridge the gap between patients and the scientific community by being the translators between these two worlds. The publishing community has started to recognize its responsibility in delivering and facilitating access to its discoveries to patients and the general public. In this context, journals can play a key role in reducing scientific language barriers by allowing patients and the public to contribute and author publishable &lt;strong&gt;“Patients perspectives”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patient and public involvement (PPI) is essentially the research being carried out by researchers alongside members of the public rather than to, about, or for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several other strategies could be implemented in peer-review journals to welcome patients on board during the publication process and ensure patient-friendly access to information. Some examples could include inviting published authors &lt;strong&gt;to write a lay summary&lt;/strong&gt; of their work (in one or more languages), &lt;strong&gt;a patient information note&lt;/strong&gt;, and/or &lt;strong&gt;depict an infographic&lt;/strong&gt; to make it easily accessible to the general public. These can provide practical advice for patients based on the available evidence for the screening, assessment, and management of specific diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, submission guidelines could be implemented to help discern the studies complying with PPI guidelines, such as mandating &lt;strong&gt;the inclusion of the GRIPP-2 checklist&lt;/strong&gt;. This requirement would help to understand how the participation of patients would improve these studies’ results compared to those studies without their involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new normal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Innovations like creating and training&lt;strong&gt; a pool of engaged patient reviewers&lt;/strong&gt; to better understand their points of view and needs for submitted manuscripts which were hard to imagine a decade ago, could represent a revolution for the patients and the scientific community. Scientific articles presenting studies designed and conducted by patients to support patients are already a reality. In the last two years, the Osteoarthritis Patients Task Force which includes this blog’s author, a global alliance of patient organizations fighting against osteoarthritis, led by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oafifoundation.com/en/foundation/&quot;&gt;Osteoarthritis Foundation International (OAFI)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arthritis.org/&quot;&gt;Arthritis Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the results of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-019-2895-3&quot;&gt;a systematic review&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-020-03741-0&quot;&gt;a global survey&lt;/a&gt; analyzing patients with osteoarthritis’ perceptions of quality of life and associated factors. Both contribute in raising awareness of patients’ conditions and perspectives in a rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have entered an era of patient centricity, perspective, independence and auto-responsibility. There is still a long road ahead to go but we have already walked the first steps on it. If patients’ organizations and the editorial board of international journals join their efforts to give the perspectives of patients more visibility, then groundbreaking transformations can happen in health research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abstract for the talk is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large-scale numerical simulations of brain circuit models are important for identifying hypotheses on brain functions and testing their consistency and plausibility.
Similarly, spiking neural networks are also gaining traction in machine learning with the promise that neuromorphic hardware will eventually make them much more energy efficient than classical ANNs.
In this dev session, we will present the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt;-enhanced Neuronal Networks) framework [1], which aims to facilitate the use of graphics accelerators for computational models of large-scale spiking neuronal networks to address the challenge of efficient simulations.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; is an open source library that generates code to accelerate the execution of network simulations on &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NVIDIA&lt;/span&gt; GPUs through a flexible and extensible interface, which does not require in-depth technical knowledge from the users.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; was originally developed as a pure C++ and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/technologies/cuda/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUDA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; library but, subsequently, we have added a Python interface and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.khronos.org/opencl/&quot;&gt;OpenCL&lt;/a&gt; backend.
The Python interface has enabled us to develop a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/&quot;&gt;PyNN&lt;/a&gt; [2] frontend and we are also working on a Keras-inspired frontend for spike-based machine learning [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the session we will briefly cover the history and basic philosophy of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; and show some simple examples of how it is used and how it works inside.
We will then talk in more depth about its development with a focus on testing for &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt; dependent software and some of the further developments such as Brian2GeNN [4].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is an initiative to provide a ready to use Fedora based Free/Open source software platform for neuroscience.
We believe that similar to Free software, science should be free for all to use, share, modify, and study.
The use of Free software also aids reproducibility, data sharing, and collaboration in the research community.
By making the tools used in the scientific process easier to use, NeuroFedora aims to take a step to enable this ideal.
In this session, I will talk about the deliverables of the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; project and then go over the complete pipeline that we use to produce, test, and disseminate them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://briansimulator.org/&quot;&gt;Brian Simulator&lt;/a&gt; is a free, open-source simulator for spiking neural networks, written in Python.
It provides researchers with the means to express any kind of neural model in mathematical notation and takes care of translating these model descriptions into efficient executable code.
During this dev session I will first give a quick introduction to the simulator itself and its code generation mechanism.
I will then walk through Brian’s code structure, our automatic systems for tests and documentation, and demonstrate how we work on its development.
The Brian simulator welcome contributions on many levels, hopefully this dev session will give you an idea where to start.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The abstract for the talk is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurolib-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;neurolib&lt;/a&gt; is a computational framework for whole-brain modelling written in Python.
It provides a set of neural mass models that represent the average activity of a brain region on a mesoscopic scale.
In a whole-brain network model, brain regions are connected with each other based on structural connectivity data, i.e. the connectome of the brain.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurolib-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;neurolib&lt;/a&gt; can load structural and functional data sets, set up a whole-brain model, manage its parameters, simulate it, and organize its outputs for later analysis.
The activity of each brain region can be converted into a simulated &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BOLD&lt;/span&gt; signal in order to calibrate the model to empirical data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
Extensive model analysis is possible using a parameter exploration module, which allows to characterize the model’s behaviour given a set of changing parameters.
An optimization module allows for fitting a model to multimodal empirical data using an evolutionary algorithm.
Besides its included functionality, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurolib-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;neurolib&lt;/a&gt; is designed to be extendable such that custom neural mass models can be implemented easily.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurolib-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;neurolib&lt;/a&gt; offers a versatile platform for computational neuroscientists for prototyping models, managing large numerical experiments, studying the structure-function relationship of brain networks, and for in-silico optimization of whole-brain models.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/06/e-cigarette-1301664_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the Tobacco Policy Review Group published &lt;em&gt;Tobacco Free Ireland&lt;/em&gt;, a report which set a target for Ireland to reduce smoking prevalence to less than 5% by 2025. The report identified tobacco-related harm reduction as a key issue for consideration. Since e-cigarettes’ launch in the European Union (EU) in 2006 and in the United States of America (USA) in 2007, research on their potential benefits in terms of tobacco-related harm reduction, and on the public health harms of e-cigarettes, has grown. The systematic evidence review reported in this piece outlines what is known to date about using e-cigarette and initiation of smoking tobacco cigarettes among teenagers. There are two sister reviews: the first maps the harms and benefits of e-cigarettes [McCarthy 2020] and the second presents a systematic review of e-cigarettes role in smoking cessation [Quigley 2020]. These reviews are one of the inputs to the Irish governments policy and clinical guidelines on e-cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-10935-1&quot;&gt;Our systematic review&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; found that e-cigarette use among teenagers in Europe and North America was associated with starting tobacco cigarette smoking. Based on nine primary studies’ adjusted odds ratios, our meta-analysis calculated a three to six times higher odds of starting tobacco cigarette smoking for teenagers who had ever used e-cigarettes at baseline. These findings identify an important health-related harm and are supported by four other systematic reviews. [Soneji 2017; Glasser 2019; Khouja 2019; Aladeokin and Haighton 2019] Three of these reviews were among young adults [Soneji 2017; Glasser 2019; Khouja 2019] and one was in teenagers living in the UK [Aladeokin and Haighton 2019]. These findings are important because the prevalence of e-cigarette use is increasing in Europe and North America. For example, the prevalence of e-cigarette use among teenagers in the USA increased from 1.5% in 2011 to 20.8% in 2018 [Cullen 2018] and in Ireland ever use is 22% [Költő 2020]. Additionally, there is a danger that society will not be able to protect achievements in declining tobacco cigarette initiation among teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study provides added support for urgent response by policymakers to stop their use by teenagers to decrease direct harms in this susceptible population group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the availability and usage of e-cigarettes, this study provides added support for urgent response by policymakers to stop their use by teenagers to decrease direct harms in this susceptible population group. The study presented in this paper was conducted as part of broader program of evidence reviews to inform and support public health policy in Ireland, which included mapping of the harms and benefits of e-cigarettes (and their e-liquids) [McCarthy 2020] and a systematic review of e-cigarettes role in smoking cessation [Quigley 2020]. We found that e-cigarettes (and their e-liquids) lead to acute harms such as poisoning, lung injury, and burns and blast injuries, a finding aligned with six other systematic reviews [Peruga 2020; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, Medicine2018, Pisinger 2014; CADTH 2017; Byrne 2018; Bals 2019] and highlighted a need for continuing study using robust methods to measure the long-term health impacts of their use as these are not yet known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children and adolescents require the same protection from e-cigarettes as conventional tobacco cigarettes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children and adolescents require the same protection from e-cigarettes as conventional tobacco cigarettes through a well-enforced regulatory regime of measures including age restriction on purchase, control of availability through licensing outlets, limits to product visibility and attractiveness, and appropriate pricing through taxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join us for a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; showcase at the 30th Annual meeting of the Organization for Computational Neuroscience (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnsorg.org&quot;&gt;OCNS&lt;/a&gt;) on July 3, 2021.
You can register for CNS*2021 &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2021&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The showcase will also be recorded for later viewing.
The description of the showcase is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Neuroscience is heavily dependent on the availability of Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) tools that support the modern scientific process.
While more and more tools are now being developed using FOSS driven methods to ensure free (free to use, study, modify, and share---and so also free of cost) access to all, the complexity of these domain specific tools makes their uptake by the multi-disciplinary neuroscience target audience non-trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NeuroFedora community initiative aims to make it easier for all to use neuroscience software tools.
Using the resources of the FOSS Fedora community, NeuroFedora volunteers identify, package, test, document, and disseminate neuroscience software for easy usage on the general purpose FOSS Fedora Linux Operating System (OS).
As a result, users can easily install a myriad of software tools in only two steps: install any flavour of the Fedora OS; install the required tools using the in-built package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make common computational neuroscience tools even more accessible, NeuroFedora now provides an OS image that is ready to download and use.
Users can obtain the CompNeuroFedora OS image  from the community website at &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://labs.fedoraproject.org/&quot;&gt;https://labs.fedoraproject.org/&lt;/a&gt; .
They can either install it, or run it “live” from the installation image.
The software showcase will introduce the audience to the NeuroFedora community initiative.
It will demonstrate the CompNeuroFedora installation image and the plethora of software tools for computational neuroscience that it includes.
It will also give the audience a quick overview of how the NeuroFedora community functions and how they may contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User documentation for NeuroFedora can be found at &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2021/06/02/concerns-about-marseilles-ihumi-amu-papers-part-1/"/>
		<id>http://scienceintegritydigest.com/?p=2587</id>
		<updated>2021-06-03T05:46:13+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;Last March, I shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2020/03/24/thoughts-on-the-gautret-et-al-paper-about-hydroxychloroquine-and-azithromycin-treatment-of-covid-19-infections/&quot;&gt;my concerns&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996&quot;&gt;a paper &lt;/a&gt;from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/en/&quot;&gt;IHU-Méditerranée Infection&lt;/a&gt; (IHUMI)/ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.univ-amu.fr/en&quot;&gt;Aix-Marseille University&lt;/a&gt; (AMU) claiming that Hydroxychloroquine in combination with Azithromycin could reduce coronavirus viral loads faster than no treatment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other papers by this group of researchers led by Professor Didier Raoult and/or his right-hand man Professor Eric Chabrière, also appear to contain problems, ranging from potentially duplicated images to ethical concerns. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this blog post I have gathered the papers by the Raoult and Chabrière group that have image concerns. This post is not an accusation of misconduct, but a compilation of the potential problems found in 22 different papers by this group.  I welcome the authors removing any concerns by providing the original figures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-2587&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Concerns about duplicated images&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A set of at least 22 papers from the AMU/IHUMI group appear to have problematic images, including unexpected similarities across or even within figure panels. All of these have been posted on Pubpeer, including nineteen that I found and posted there. As of today the authors have not replied to most of these PubPeer posts, nor have they corrected the errors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Category I duplications&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some papers, such as DOI: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8135188/&quot;&gt;10.1093/ajcp/101.3.318&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/FF00F9CF37B71EE26560B12659F1ED&quot;&gt;PubPeer&lt;/a&gt;] or &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17337224/&quot;&gt;10.1016/j.ijid.2006.10.005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/21381A2B9753BDC9DB7D2F1957088A&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/21381A2B9753BDC9DB7D2F1957088A&quot;&gt;PubPeer&lt;/a&gt;] appear to contain ‘simple’ duplications in figure panels. As explained in &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2019/11/23/scanning-for-duplications/&quot;&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I call these &lt;strong&gt;Category I duplications&lt;/strong&gt;, where the exact same photo is used to represent two different experiments. These kinds of simple duplications can often be honest errors, where something went wrong during the paper submission or manuscript handling. A cheerful “Oops, yes you are right, we made an error” would have been enough, and these duplicated panels could be easily addressed with a Corrigendum. Unfortunately, the authors have not replied to most of the PubPeer posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Category II duplications&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two papers in this set contain &lt;strong&gt;Category II duplications&lt;/strong&gt;, where images overlap or might have been rotated, mirrored, etc. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DOI &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26598566/&quot;&gt;10.4269/ajtmh.15-0436&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/D2FBE34F49E965A8BE6730E531E9F1&quot;&gt;PubPeer&lt;/a&gt;] has been corrected after posting it on PubPeer. In this paper, three of the four panels shown in Figure 1 were showing the same specimen. The aspect ratio of these overlapping areas, marked below with blue and magenta boxes, was not always the same. It appears the images might have been stretched differently, which would be unexpected if the errors were unintentional. Yet, the journal accepted a new set of panels in the July 2020 correction. The authors wrote: “&lt;em&gt;These resulted from errors by a researcher that were missed by other authors. Specifically, a single image was inappropriately inserted to represent three different experiments.&lt;/em&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;

Of note, the name of senior author Didier Raoult was removed some time between the acceptance of the paper [&lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.319.1904&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&quot;&gt;JCM Accepts version&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/yjnmL&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;] and the publication of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/JCM.01714-06?download=true&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; on the journal’s website. In 2006, the year this paper was published, Raoult was banned from publishing in ASM journals for 1 year, which might have something to do with this author name removal (source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6072/1033)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6072/1033)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Category III duplications&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At least 10 AMU/IHUM papers with image problems contain &lt;strong&gt;Category III duplications&lt;/strong&gt;, where figures appear to have been altered or to contain duplicated elements. These types of duplications are the most likely to be the result of an intention-to-mislead. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Category III duplications were found in these papers:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As a scientist, interacting with data allows you to gain new insight into the phenomena you’re studying. If you read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/30/us/2020-year-in-graphics.html&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://d3js.org/&quot;&gt;D3&lt;/a&gt; docs or you browse &lt;a href=&quot;https://distill.pub/&quot;&gt;distill&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see impressive browser-based visualizations – interactive storytelling that not only accurately represent data but bring your attention to surprising aspects of it. Making good visualizations of your work can increase the accessibility of your research to a wide audience. My favorite example here (already several years old) is the semantic map of the brain from James Gao, Alex Huth, Jack Gallant and crew – at the time, visualizing brain map data in the browser was unheard of, and here was a visualization of how semantics map to different brain areas, in the browser, no downloads necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7653&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7653&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-1.png?w=564&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-1.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-1.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;564,413&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-1-4/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-1.png?w=564&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Snapshot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gallantlab.org/brainviewer/Deniz2019/&quot;&gt;brain data visualization&lt;/a&gt; from James Gao, Jack Gallant, Alex Huth and crew. Built on three.js and tornado. You can make these kind of visualizations yourself with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gallantlab/pycortex&quot;&gt;pycortex library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coming from the Python world, most visualizations you’ll make on a day-to-day basis will be very different from these: static plots, because that’s what’s convenient to make in matplotlib. How can you go from the Python world of static plots to the wizardry of Javascript?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A big wall you’ll run into is that modern web development is big. Getting to proficiency is hard: it’s very easy to get discouraged and fall off the wagon before you get to build something interesting. What I’ve assembled here is a kind of roadmap so that you can start building interesting dynamic visualizations with the lowest barrier to entry as possible, while building a self-reinforcing skillset. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-table is-style-stripes&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Technology&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Application areas&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Pros&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Cons&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;What you learn&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Python-based generators&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dashboards, lightweight interactions&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Easy distribution, low barrier to entry&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Limited interactivity&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Grammar of interactive graphics&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Jupyter notebook&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Daily data exploration&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;You’re already using it!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Distribution not straightforward&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Snippets of HTML, JS, SVG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Walled garden&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;All-in-one visualizations (widgets)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Limited things to learn&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;What you learn is non-transferable&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The walled garden&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;JS notebooks&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Literate programs&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;REPL environment, good docs&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Learning curve a bit steep&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Core JS plus visualization libraries&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;The web&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Web dataviz&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;You control everything&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Floodgates of tech stack, learning curve quite steep&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Packaging, components, deployment&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, at the end of this article, I cover JS libraries you might want to learn to do for plotting or numeric work. I’ve built this from experience over the last year experimenting with about a half-dozen interactive visualization methods; of course, if you know better curricula, books or tutorials, please let me know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Step 0: Python-based libraries&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your first option is to not code for the web at all by leveraging pure Python-based libraries. Many libraries aim to fill a niche for everyday interactive graphics, which include minimal interactions – hover interactions, tooltips, interactive legends, etc. This includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://plotly.com/&quot;&gt;Plotly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://holoviews.org/user_guide/Dashboards.html&quot;&gt;Bokeh w/Holoviews&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/interactions.html&quot;&gt;Altair w/vegalite&lt;/a&gt;. On the mapping side, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet&quot;&gt;ipyleaflet&lt;/a&gt; is worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Dashboard tools&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7657&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7657&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-2&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;838,742&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-2-4/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-2.png?w=300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/demo-uber-nyc-pickups/&quot;&gt;A demo visualization in streamlit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There has been an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/patrickmineault/status/1397574692135919617&quot;&gt;explosive growth in the past few years&lt;/a&gt;. These solutions fill the same niche as the ubiquitous Shiny fills in the R ecosystem: a way for data science teams to create dashboards. You can nevertheless use them for interactive scientific visualizations. Getting familiar with this kind of visualization will help you build a grammar of interactive visualizations and rapidly prototype more fully interactive visualizations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to expect: a Python script defines a visualization (plots, videos, images, maps, etc.) along with widgets, such as sliders and combo boxes. The whole thing gets served via a server which caches requests intelligently – changes in sliders trigger remote fetches which refresh the visualization. Some custom visualizations may be written in JS. Oftentimes, dashboard solutions are associated with a specific plotting library. so all the docs will be written in terms of that library – but generally you have some flexibility to use other frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One clarification: if you want to share your visualizations, you’ll need a server. All solutions have a basic open source offering allowing you to DIY deploy such a server yourself via e.g. a cloud provider. If that sounds messy, you can instead opt for a managed cloud solution – there’s often a free tier and paid tiers with more capabilities availables. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-table is-style-stripes&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Product&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Deployment&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Peculiarities&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Associated plotting library&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://panel.holoviz.org/&quot;&gt;Panel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DIY&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Works inside of jupyter and standalone&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Bokeh, with support other charting libraries&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://streamlit.io/&quot;&gt;Streamlit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DIY &amp;amp; commercial&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Very easy deploys&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Agnostic&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plotly.com/dash/&quot;&gt;Dash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DIY &amp;amp; commercial&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Supports lots of customization, aimed at enterprise users&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Plotly, with support for other libraries&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of these, Streamlit seems to have the most momentum according to Github stars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-6.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7716&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7716&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-6&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-6.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-6.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-6.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1454,896&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-6-3/&quot; height=&quot;412&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-6.png?w=1024&quot; width=&quot;681&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;See this article for &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/streamlit-vs-dash-vs-voil%C3%A0-vs-panel-battle-of-the-python-dashboarding-giants-177c40b9ea57&quot;&gt;a detailed breakdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: build for jupyter notebook&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the lowest friction way of doing dynamic HTML-based visualization in Python is in the jupyter notebook environment (or jupyter lab or colab). After all, you’re writing Python inside the browser &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;, why not use the same environment to whip up a quick interactive visualization? A big advantage of this type of solution is that it minimizes the contortions you have to go through to translate Python data types to javascript. And because you’re writing HTML, JS and Python side-by-side, your iteration cycles are very fast. The biggest problem is that most widgets you will create here will not display correctly when you publish them to the web, e.g. on GitHub: people will have to download the notebook to get the interactive effect. They will work inside of Binder, however. They are a great way to dip your toe into this world – at this point, you can probably get by by copying and pasting snippets of HTML, CSS, SVG and Javascript rather than formally learning them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;_repr_html_ and IPython.core.display&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Image&quot; height=&quot;126&quot; src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2sASUzXMAMrd68?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=large&quot; width=&quot;417&quot; /&gt;Basic demo of _repr_html_&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you print a variable at the end of a Jupyter cell, how does Jupyter know how to display it? The answer is that it looks for a &lt;code&gt;_repr_html_&lt;/code&gt; method for the associated class and calls it. This function can return any arbitrary snippet of HTML, including an iframe which does interactive things, or a snippet which embeds javascript. &lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eXwpjEzMMzu5EllJ3ljq_zEMVFAnifUR?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;See this colab for examples on how to do this&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mrocklin/status/1145265419638513669&quot;&gt;You can do fairly sophisticated things with this simple method&lt;/a&gt;, for instance building an interactive widget for pandas. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You may also trigger a rich display from anywhere inside a cell, not just at the end, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25698448/how-to-embed-html-into-ipython-output&quot;&gt;using the ipython API&lt;/a&gt;. Again, you can include any number of web technologies, including embedding scripts inside the embedded HTML.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code &quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;from IPython.core.display import display, HTML
display(HTML('&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Hello, world!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;'))
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;ipywidgets and interact&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ipywidgets&lt;/strong&gt;, also known as jupyter-widgets or simply widgets, are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Index.ipynb&quot;&gt;interactive HTML widgets&lt;/a&gt; for Jupyter notebooks and the IPython kernel. Notebooks come alive when interactive widgets are used. Users gain control of their data and can visualize changes in the data. Learning becomes an immersive, fun experience. Researchers can easily see how changing inputs to a model impact the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot;&gt;The ipywidget manual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next in line in complexity are &lt;code&gt;ipywidgets&lt;/code&gt;. Like &lt;code&gt;IPython.core.display&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ipywidgets&lt;/code&gt; can display rich HTML; however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20Events.html&quot;&gt;widgets can also have events which cause them to call Python&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eXwpjEzMMzu5EllJ3ljq_zEMVFAnifUR#scrollTo=aFiczwJ9h5v5&quot;&gt;See this notebook for an example&lt;/a&gt;. You can use them, for instance, to navigate through a plot with widgets. In fact, this pattern is so common that there’s a convenience function called &lt;code&gt;interact&lt;/code&gt; which allows you to do just slider-based interactions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;voila&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/voila-dashboards/voila/master/voila-bqplot.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila&quot;&gt;Voila example, from their docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building on jupyter widgets, you can release fully fledged dashboards based in jupyter notebooks. This is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila&quot;&gt;voila&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is that you write a regular jupyter notebook, and then you can serve it through a tornado server on the web. The end user sees a dashboard which is the concatenation of the output cells of the dashboard, without the code. You can deploy this on Heroku or Google App Engine to make your application world accessible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Walled gardens&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this point, you might feel stifled by the limited interactivity afforded by the solutions offered so far. And you might feel intimidated by full-fledged modern web development. Many products exist to fill the gap. However, I argue here that it’s better to bite the bullet and skip straight ahead to writing &lt;em&gt;real javascript&lt;/em&gt; in a notebook environment, because you will continue building on core skill sets around web technology. Nevertheless, I mention these options here for completeness and because they may satisfy your particular use case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Unity&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;A little Plinko sim&lt;img alt=&quot;🎄&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f384.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 1em;&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/unity3d?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#unity3d&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/geKwfhlpj6&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/geKwfhlpj6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Patrick Mineault (@patrickmineault) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/patrickmineault/status/1209900584473632770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 25, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unity.com/&quot;&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt; is a game development engine and IDE. It’s a great environment to build offline games and VR visualizations. It transpiles exported scenes and C#-based scripting to WebAssembly (WASM), so it also runs in the browser. C# is a modern language with operator overloading. 2d and 3d interaction are easily accommodated. Cons: widgets (sliders, input boxes, etc.) must be created in the Unity interface and are non-native. The Unity applet acts as a walled garden, making it &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-interactingwithbrowserscripting.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;difficult to interact with the native DOM&lt;/a&gt;. The C# code cannot be compiled with a command line tool – it must be combined with the project and compiled in the Unity editor, and the project is several GBs, hence can’t be tracked in Github. Furthermore, the math libraries in C# are pretty limited. Overall, a pretty limited option for the web, though it has considerable appeal if you’re doing 3d viz.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;p5.js and openprocessing&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress wp-embed-aspect-1-1 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OpenProcessing sketch, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openprocessing.org/sketch/853689&quot;&gt;Self-organized critical model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://p5js.org/&quot;&gt;p5.js&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openprocessing.org/&quot;&gt;openprocessing&lt;/a&gt; bring processing – a creative coding platform – to javascript. You write sketches, with an init function and a loop function, which define how the sketch works. You draw into the sketch with functions that allow you to draw lines, rectangles, sprites, polygons, etc. The appeal of processing is that you’re learning creative coding and there are very little barriers to entry. The biggest con is that while you learn a little bit of javascript in the environments, you really don’t learn modern web technologies. At the end of the day, you’ll know how to draw into your sketch, but you won’t know about canvas, svg, css, etc. – and you’ll be limited in the libraries that you can import into that environment. That being said, they can be part of your toolkit, especially p5.js which can interop with plain JS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Javascript notebooks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step in complexity is Javascript-based notebooks. Just as there are Python-based notebook environments that use remote kernels (jupyter, colab), there are local notebook-based environments that use Javascript that runs locally in the browser. That means you get the full power of the web – html, canvas, css, svg, javascript with remote libraries, etc. – but you’re doing it in an environment on wheels which supports the familiar REPL workflow of jupyter notebooks. These are environments which are ideal for literate programming which mixes text, math, code and visualization. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For many, I suspect this will be the right level of complexity. In practice, using notebooks mean you will need to export your data out of Python in order to visualize it – for many use cases, json will do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Observable&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7664&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7664&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-3&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=603&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;603,602&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-3-3/&quot; height=&quot;572&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/image-3.png?w=603&quot; width=&quot;573&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Text, code, equations, dynamic visualizations can all be mixed in observable. &lt;a href=&quot;https://observablehq.com/@xcorr/optimal-control-example&quot;&gt;Code here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://observablehq.com/&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/a&gt; is a notebook environment that runs in the browser, created by Mike Bostock, creator of d3. Observable is a little like jupyter notebooks, but it uses a kind of functional style where each cell may only have one output, and it resolves the DAG of dependencies to figure out which cells to recompute at what time, thus avoiding the pitfalls of ipython out-of-order execution issues.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://observablehq.com/tutorials&quot;&gt;It has an excellent set of starter tutorials&lt;/a&gt;. The observable runtime is open-source, but the notebook environment is closed-source. It continues to be feverishly developed – they just added multi-user collaboration. Strictly speaking, &lt;a href=&quot;https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observables-not-javascript&quot;&gt;it does not use Javascript&lt;/a&gt;, and it doesn’t make it very easy to export strict JS out of it – however, you can embed single cells on a webpage. Overall, a great place to get your REPL workflow going.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Starboard&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7671&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7671&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;coupled-oscillators&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=380&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;380,380&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/coupled-oscillators/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/coupled-oscillators.gif?w=380&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;An interactive visualization of coupled oscillators in Starboard, mixed Python and JS. &lt;a href=&quot;https://starboard.gg/pmin/desync-nKw0R7a&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://starboard.gg/&quot;&gt;Starboard&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source interactive notebook environment. It uses a different metaphor than Observable, sticking much closer to the Jupyter metaphor with its advantages and disadvantages. The biggest thing it has going for is that it supports both javascript and python via &lt;a href=&quot;https://pyodide.org/en/stable/&quot;&gt;Pyodide&lt;/a&gt;. What’s that you say? Python in the browser? Why yes, in fact:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pyodide brings the Python 3.8 runtime to the browser via WebAssembly, along with the Python scientific stack including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and scikit-learn. The packages directory lists over 75 packages which are currently available. In addition it’s possible to install pure Python wheels from PyPi. Pyodide provides transparent conversion of objects between Javascript and Python. When used inside a browser, Python has full access to the Web APIs.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Pyodide docs&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means you can keep some of the numerical computation in Python and mix and match JS and Python as necessary – though you’ll probably still want to use Javascript to manipulate the DOM. Pyodide was originally spun out by Mozilla from another (now defunct) notebook project called iodide, so starboard, along with a few others like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jtpio/jupyterlite&quot;&gt;jupyterlite&lt;/a&gt; are carrying the torch. I really like starboard – the editor feels great, it’s snappy, it has surprisingly little confusing magic going on. However, the documentation and examples are minimal, and it would benefit from a series of tutorials. I think observable is the more viable and mature option in this space for now but starboard is one to watch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: the web&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now you’ve had a chance to learn javascript, html, svg, enough css to do the job in the context of dynamic visualizations, and now you’re ready to tackle the world – the world wide web! It’s tempting at this point to learn modern web development, with its complex toolchains (npm + react + webpack + …) . I had an interesting conversation with Chris Olah recently who mentioned that when it comes to doing visualizations, the core skillsets – html, the dom, css, svg, etc. – are more important than learning any particular framework, and it helped organize this article. If you do need a component framework to work within a larger page, a more lightweight framework, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/&quot;&gt;Svelte&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;vue.js&lt;/a&gt;, might satisfy your needs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One very annoying gotcha you’ll run into is packaging differences between node and JS built for the web. A lot of packages you’ll use for data analysis in JS – like mathjs – were originally built for the node server environment. You need to build them to use them, which means learning about build tools, and pretty soon you’ve wasted a couple of days figuring out your transpiler. There are now cloud transpilers, in particular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skypack.dev/&quot;&gt;skypack&lt;/a&gt; and JSPM, that will compile node JS libraries for you so you can use them immediately without using a complex toolchain. That means you can import node packages in JS much in the same way you would import pip installable packages in Python:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;import * as mathjs from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/mathjs@8.0.1';
console.log(mathjs.add(1,2));&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Guido Zuidhof &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gzuidhof/starboard-notebook/issues/42&quot;&gt;for patiently explaining this to me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some templates exist to facilitate the creation of interactive blog posts or articles. Most notably, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/distillpub/template&quot;&gt;distill template&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://idyll-lang.org/docs&quot;&gt;the Idyll language&lt;/a&gt; facilitate the creation of explanatory articles (think those cool articles on the nytimes website which highlight different parts of graphs when you scroll down). Some of the best examples of this type of article can be seen on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://visxai.io/&quot;&gt;VISxAI website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For deployment, provided you don’t rely on external services, you could use github pages, or use a CDN service like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/&quot;&gt;netlify&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://vercel.com/&quot;&gt;Vercel&lt;/a&gt;. If you need to interact with data, then you may need to both create and deploy a data source via a REST API. Something lightweight like &lt;a href=&quot;https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/&quot;&gt;flask&lt;/a&gt; deployed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackabuse.com/deploying-a-flask-application-to-heroku&quot;&gt;heroku&lt;/a&gt; would do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;JS libraries&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you’re going through this process, it will often feel like the garden of forking paths: seemingly infinite decisions to make. However, there’s a small core set of JS libraries you might interact with:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;d3: data driven documents in JS, &lt;a href=&quot;https://d3js.org/&quot;&gt;https://d3js.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;mathjs: math, vectors, matrices in JS: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mathjs.org/&quot;&gt;https://mathjs.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;stdlib: a standard library for JS, including distributions: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib&quot;&gt;https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vega lite: declarative plots in JS: &lt;a href=&quot;https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/&quot;&gt;https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tensorflow.js: tensor computation library in the browser: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/js&quot;&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three.js: 3d visualizations for the web: &lt;a href=&quot;https://threejs.org/&quot;&gt;https://threejs.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arquero: like dplyr, for the web: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uwdata/arquero&quot;&gt;https://github.com/uwdata/arquero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think this is enough of a curriculum to carry you from 0 to 1 over a 6 month period. Practice, learn, and in no time you’ll be ready to make solid visualizations!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Further resources&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;arXiv’s members have provided approximately 25% of our operating budget for the past ten years, supporting arXiv’s mission to provide a reliable open platform for sharing research. By becoming arXiv members, more than 230 institutions around the world have made a strong statement in favor of open access, open science, and sustainable academic publishing. Thank you, members!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy to announce our &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/membership&quot;&gt;updated membership program&lt;/a&gt;, which was developed in collaboration with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/people/member_ad_board&quot;&gt;Membership Advisory Board&lt;/a&gt;. This program is part of our&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/05/26/arxiv-sustainability-model/&quot;&gt; sustainability model&lt;/a&gt;, complements arXiv’s diverse &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/funding&quot;&gt;funding sources, including societies and other organizations, &lt;/a&gt;and ensures that arXiv will have the funding required to continue meeting researchers’ evolving needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv membership is inclusive, flexible, and offers your institution a high value, low-risk, budget-conscious option to serve your scholarly community. Members receive public recognition, institutional usage statistics, eligibility to serve in arXiv’s governance, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universities, libraries, research institutes, and laboratories are invited to join or renew. For standard memberships, annual fees are based on submissions by institution, averaged over three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_institution_submissions&quot;&gt;find your institution’s overall submission rank here,&lt;/a&gt; as shown in the screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_1003&quot; style=&quot;width: 836px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot of interface to find submissions by institution&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1003 size-full&quot; height=&quot;377&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/Find-submissions-by-institution-1.png&quot; width=&quot;836&quot; /&gt;Hover your cursor over the area indicated by the purple arrow to reveal the search icon.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, match the overall rank to one of the contribution levels here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;If an institution ranks in the top 100 submitting institutions, their fee is $5000. Institutions ranked between 101 and 500 are charged $2500. Institutions ranked above 500 are charged $1000.&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-1004 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/Member-Levels-2021-05-26-at-11.08.59-AM.png&quot; width=&quot;409&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The top 100 institutions submitting articles to arXiv are invited to become members at the $5,000 level. The fee for institutions ranked between 101 and 500 is $2,500, and the fee for institutions ranked above 501 is $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Institutions that join or renew now will lock in their membership fee for 2022, 2023, and 2024. Institutions joining as part of a consortium will receive a 10% discount. Country-level consortia will receive a higher discount, depending on the level of participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In the example below, the university’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_institution_submissions&quot;&gt;overall submission rank&lt;/a&gt; is 182, which corresponds to the $2500 standard membership fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_1008&quot; style=&quot;width: 746px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Example submission data&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1008 size-full&quot; height=&quot;149&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/Submissions-example.png&quot; width=&quot;746&quot; /&gt;The overall rank, which is the three year submission average, is indicated by the purple arrow.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two flexible alternatives&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your institution is a champion of open access and has the budget to support a higher contribution, we offer the &lt;strong&gt;Champion&lt;/strong&gt; membership at $10,000 and above. Other institutions use arXiv &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_institution_downloads_by_year&quot;&gt;primarily for reading&lt;/a&gt; or face significant budget limitations. For these institutions, &lt;strong&gt;Community&lt;/strong&gt; membership is our most inclusive option, at an amount between $250 and $1000. All members receive the same benefits and are eligible to serve in arXiv’s governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join or renew today&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready to commit to open access, open science, and sustainable academic publishing? &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/membership_confirm&quot;&gt;Join, renew, or confirm your membership here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you represent a nonprofit or a company? &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/support_confirm&quot;&gt;Confirm your support here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions? &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:membership@arxiv.org&quot;&gt;We’re happy to help.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we are grateful to our strong community of supporters and everyone who contributed to developing our updated sustainability model and membership program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<updated>2021-06-02T15:43:40+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">
 &lt;p&gt;In collaboration with the Membership Advisory Board and arXiv’s leadership team, we’re pleased to announce &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/funding&quot;&gt;arXiv’s updated sustainability model&lt;/a&gt;. This model, which is an expansion of the existing membership program, complements funding received from Cornell University, the Simons Foundation, and individual donors — and ensures that arXiv thrives for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nearly ten years, members have supported arXiv with funding and expertise — and for that we are grateful! As arXiv has grown, the number of organizations we interact with has expanded greatly, reflecting arXiv’s interdisciplinary nature. To welcome this wonderful diversity and encourage the entire arXiv community to contribute to arXiv’s financial future, we’ve expanded our sustainability model to include three programs for specific types of supporters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Members &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our membership program will remain central to arXiv’s sustainability. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/ourmembers&quot;&gt;Universities, libraries, laboratories, and research institutes&lt;/a&gt; across the globe are invited to become members (or renew their existing memberships) and represent the scholars who use arXiv to read and share research. Members support arXiv with essential funding and scholarly communications expertise, and members are also eligible to serve in arXiv’s governance. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/06/02/membership-program-submissions/&quot;&gt;Learn more about updates to the membership program here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Affiliates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/supporters&quot;&gt;Professional societies, government agencies, and other nonprofits &lt;/a&gt;collaborate with arXiv in a variety of ways, ranging from facilitating conference proceeding submissions to promoting open access compliance. Suggested contribution levels range from $5,000 to $100,000, or the in-kind equivalent. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/support_confirm&quot;&gt;Become an affiliate or renew your support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sponsors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/supporters&quot;&gt;Companies&lt;/a&gt; that benefit from arXiv’s services are encouraged to support the infrastructure with funding and in-kind donations such as developer time and cloud services. Suggested contribution levels range from $10,000 to $200,000, or the in-kind equivalent. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/support_confirm&quot;&gt;Become a sponsor or renew your support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited to grow our base of supporters, remain transparent about our funding sources, ensure that the cost to operate arXiv is distributed fairly across the community, and continue to meet researchers’ evolving needs. Specifically, our priority is to provide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continuous level of service for supporting exponential growth in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions&quot;&gt;submissions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_downloads&quot;&gt;downloads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seamless interoperability with other platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increased completeness and quality of metadata records, including support for affiliation and funding information&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Minghua Zheng will talk about a paper &quot;Class-Balanced Loss Based on Effective Number of Samples&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rapid increase of large-scale, real-world datasets, it
becomes critical to address the problem of longtailed data
distribution (i.e., a few classes account for most of the data, while
most classes are under-represented). Existing solutions typically
adopt class re-balancing strategies such as re-sampling and re-
weighting based on the number of observations for each class. In this
work, we argue that as the number of samples increases, the additional
benefit of a newly added data point will diminish. We introduce a
novel theoretical framework to measure data overlap by associating
with each sample a small neighboring region rather than a single
point. The effective number of samples is defined as the volume of
samples and can be calculated by a simple formula
(1-β^n)/(1-β), where n is the number of samples and β
∈ [0, 1) is a hyperparameter. We design a re-weighting scheme that
uses the effective number of samples for each class to re-balance the
loss, thereby yielding a class-balanced loss. Comprehensive
experiments are conducted on artificially induced long-tailed CIFAR
datasets and large-scale datasets including ImageNet and iNaturalist.
Our results show that when trained with the proposed class-balanced
loss, the network is able to achieve significant performance gains on
long-tailed datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

Incorporating a concept from deep learning, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(21)00064-7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Erik Hoel (2021)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“...outlines the idea that the brains of animals are constantly in danger of &lt;i&gt;overfitting&lt;/i&gt;,  which is the lack of generalizability that occurs in a deep neural  network when its learning is based too much on one particular dataset,  and that dreams help mitigate this ubiquitous issue. This is the  overfitted brian &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;[sic]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; hypothesis.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Overfitted Brain Hypothesis (OHB) proposes that the bizarre phenomenology of dreams is critical to their functional role. This view differs from most other neuroscientific theories, which treat dream content as epiphenomenal — a byproduct of brain activity involved in memory consolidation, replay, forgetting, synaptic pruning, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Hoel suggests that “it is the very strangeness of dreams in their divergence from waking experience that gives them their biological function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hallucinogenic, category-breaking, and fabulist quality of dreams means they are extremely different from the “training set” of the animal (i.e., their daily experiences). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up: the OBH conceptualizes dreams as a form of purposefully corrupted input, likely derived from noise injected into the hierarchical structure of the brain, causing feedback to generate warped or “corrupted” sensory input. The overall evolved purpose of this stochastic activity is to prevent overfitting. This overfitting may be within a particular module or task such a specific brain region or network, and may also involve generalization to out-of-distribution (unseen) novel stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of overfitting, I was reminded of Google's foray into &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html&quot;&gt;artificial neural networks&lt;/a&gt; for image classification, which was all the rage in July 2015. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DeepDream&lt;/a&gt; program is a visualization tool that shows what the layers of the neural network have learned:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;One way to visualize what goes on is to turn the network upside down and ask it to enhance an input image in such a way as to elicit a particular interpretation. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The image above is characteristic of the hallucinogenic output from the DeepDream web interface, and it illustrates that the original training set was filled with &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20150724110554/http://jtnimoy.com/blogs/projects/50616707-deepdream-avoiding-kitsch&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dogs, birds, and pagodas&lt;/a&gt;.  DeepDream images inspired blog posts with titles like, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiweirdness.com/post/171451900302/do-neural-nets-dream-of-electric-sheep&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Do neural nets dream of electric sheep?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/technology/2015/07/google-deepdream-its-dazzling-creepy-and-tells-us-a-lot-about-the-future-of-a-i.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Do Androids Dream of Electric Bananas?&lt;/a&gt; and my favorite, &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2015/07/scary-brains-and-garden-of-earthly-deep.html&quot;&gt;Scary Brains and the Garden of Earthly Deep Dreams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reference&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoel E.

 &lt;h2&gt;Where is the spinothalamic tract?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The spinothalamic tract is a collection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; that carries information to the brain about pain, temperature, itch, and general or light touch sensations. The pathway starts with sensory neurons that synapse in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/dorsal-horn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dorsal horn of the spinal cord&lt;/a&gt;. Next, neurons extend from the dorsal horn and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/decussation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;decussate&lt;/a&gt;, or cross over to the other side of the spinal cord, before traveling up the spinal cord, through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/brainstem&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brainstem&lt;/a&gt;, and to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thalamus&lt;/a&gt;. These neurons synapse with neurons in the thalamus, which then carry the information to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/somatosensory-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;somatosensory cortex&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The lateral spinothalamic tract is the main pathway for carrying information about pain and temperature from the body to the brain. It is also thought to carry information about itch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sensations that are carried by the lateral spinothalamic tract begin with receptors such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/nociceptor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nociceptors&lt;/a&gt;, which detect painful sensations, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thermoreceptor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thermoreceptors&lt;/a&gt;, which detect changes in temperature. These receptors pass a signal to the initial neurons of the spinothalamic tract, which transmit the signal to the spinal cord. Here, the neurons briefly either ascend or descend as part of a tract called Lissauer’s tract before synapsing on neurons in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/dorsal-horn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dorsal horn of the spinal cord&lt;/a&gt; that belong to cell groups like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/nucleus-proprius&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nucleus proprius&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/substantia-gelatinosa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;substantia gelatinosa&lt;/a&gt;; the latter is an important area for the modulation of pain signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The secondary neurons in the lateral spinothalamic tract cross over to the other side of the spinal cord and then ascend in the spinal cord, through the brainstem, and to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/ventral-posterolateral-nucleus-vpl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ventral posterolateral (VPL) nucleus&lt;/a&gt; in the thalamus. Because this pathway travels in the anterolateral portion of the spinal cord and brainstem, it is often referred to as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/anterolateral-system&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;anterolateral system&lt;/a&gt;. In the thalamus, spinothalamic neurons synapse on cells that will carry the sensory information to the primary somatosensory cortex, which is the main processing area for sensations from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Anterior spinothalamic tract&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The anterior spinothalamic tract (aka ventral spinothalamic tract) carries general touch or light touch sensations from the body. This includes touch sensations that don’t involve pressure, such as the stroking of hair or air lightly blowing on the skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;These sensations begin with sensory receptors in the skin, which pass a signal onto neurons that travel to the spinal cord. In the spinal cord, these neurons give rise to ascending and descending branches that synapse on neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Secondary neurons arise from the nucleus proprius in the dorsal horn, cross over to the other side of the spinal cord, and ascend to the thalamus near the lateral spinothalamic tract. From there, the information is carried on to the somatosensory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Damage to the spinothalamic tract&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A spinal cord injury that involves the spinothalamic tract can lead to distinctive sensory deficits. Because neurons in the tract cross over to the other side of the spinal cord before traveling up to the brain, they are carrying information from the opposite side of the body. Thus, if there is damage to one side of the spinal cord, it can cause a loss of pain, temperature, and light touch sensations on the side of the body opposite from where the damage occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;References:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Augustine JR.

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Aamir Khan will talk about a paper &quot;Study of weak / strong multiplication in gain modulation&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an extension of my previous work on the multiplicative response of
spiking neural networks. In our artificial life platform I evolve a gain
modulated network where there are two Inputs namely d (driving input) and m (
the modulatory input). The network aims for a multiplicative Sigmoidal/gaussian
response modulated by the modulatory input m. The response of the network
exhibits three properties such as 1. Saturation , 2. Non linearity and
3.Multiplicity. The multiplicative capacity of the network varies from strong
to weak in a manner that for some modulatory input there is strong
multiplication and for some there is a weak multiplication, I have
differentiated the response of the network in weak/ strong response. Along with
the classification some further constraints are introduced in the system like
The size of the network tends to be larger i.e 5 nodes, in order to reduce the
size I reward the response of the one interneuron and treat it as the output
node.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/PLOS-Blogs-New-journal-announcment3-1.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It has already been a month since we &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; we’re launching five new journals. For those of you patiently waiting, we are excited to announce that the journals are now OPEN for submissions! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The responses we’ve seen so far have been overwhelmingly positive. We’d like to say a HUGE THANK YOU to those of you who have expressed your support on social media, via email, and the many hundreds of you who have applied to join the editorial boards of the journals–we have been delighted to see how our reasons for launching them have resonated with you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The journals’ websites now contain much more information on each  journal’s mission, scope, personnel, submission instructions and hopefully everything you need to consider submitting your work:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/climate&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Climate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Sustainability and Transformation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/water&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Digital Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Global Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If what you want to do is explore the journal most relevant to you, and consider it for your future work, please consider this blog post an appropriate “jumping off point” for you to do that! In summary: we have affordable, APC-free business models for all our journals available through institutional partnerships which allow unlimited publishing by all authors at the institution. We also have publishing fees/APCs for those who still need or prefer them, and an established APC-waiver program for those who cannot afford APCs but whose institutions are not yet under an institutional agreement. &lt;strong&gt;Please presume there is a way, that is appropriate for you and your context, that you will be able to publish in these new journals!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those of you who want to know more details about our institutional models, in particular librarians and others managing Open Access budgets, please read &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/open-for-submissions-part-2-models/&quot;&gt;Part 2 of this announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Our five new journals are now &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/open-for-submissions-part-1/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open for Submissions&lt;/a&gt;! This post (Part 2) is specifically geared towards librarians and/or those of you who manage budgets that support Open Access publishing. Or, simply those of you who would like more details about how we are supporting our activities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you have been keeping up to date with our business model innovations, you already know we have been working hard to move beyond the APC to develop more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access. In the past eighteen months we’ve developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flat Fee &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;greements&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Community Action Publishing&lt;/a&gt;. (Please see those links for the full details or recap of those models.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re developing new institutional models to experiment and get things right, and we thank all of you in the library community who have given us feedback. We’re learning that, right now, different types of journals can be better supported by different types of institutional models. Also, we’ve learned that some authors, funders, and countries still prefer APCs due to how they are currently funding or administering their OA publishing. We will continue to support such publication fee models for those who prefer or need them, while continuing to experiment with and develop these new institutional models to make OA work for all authors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutional models for the five new journals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Digital Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; joins the group of journals covered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flat Fee agreements&lt;/a&gt; (covering &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Digital Health, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Sustainability and Transformation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has its own &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Community Action Publishing&lt;/a&gt; setup, similar to &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine, &lt;/em&gt;to showcase how CAP can work for new journals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/climate/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Climate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/water/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Global Public Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; offer a new type of institutional business model, which we are naming the “Global Equity” model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Equity &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our new Global Equity model empowers institutions in every region of the world to provide unlimited Open Access publication support for their authors through a single, annual fee that is affordable and equitably reflects regional economies. The annual fee is based on:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an &lt;strong&gt;institution’s &lt;/strong&gt;research output in the relevant &lt;strong&gt;subject area&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;helping us understand the likely potential to publish in the journal, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the relevant &lt;strong&gt;country’s &lt;/strong&gt;World Bank lending tier (i.e. Low/Low-Middle Income Country (L/LMIC), Upper Middle Income Country (UMIC), High Income Country (HIC). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Global Equity model’s annual price will therefore allow a large institution in a LMIC to pay less than one of comparable size in an HIC, but more than a small institution in an LMIC. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors at institutions in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.research4life.org/access/eligibility/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research4Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (R4L) countries (both group A and group B) can publish for free, regardless of the size of the institution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The following table shows the annual prices for institutions, per journal. Tier 1 is a high output institution in the subject area, to Tier 6 being a low output institution in the subject area. For example, a low output institution in a LMIC interested in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Climate &lt;/em&gt;would pay &lt;strong&gt;$350&lt;/strong&gt; per year to cover unlimited publishing by its authors in that journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary Information and Comparison Table&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of you reading this post are likely librarians or other people administering OA budgets. However, if you are an author and are simply interested in submitting to a PLOS journal that is of interest to you, &lt;strong&gt;please presume&lt;/strong&gt; there is a way, &lt;strong&gt;that is appropriate for you and your context&lt;/strong&gt;, that you will be able to publish in these new journals:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If APCs do not work for you and you would like your institution to join any of these institutional agreements, please send your librarian this &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/contact-plos/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, or refer them via this &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/refer/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are a librarian, please contact us via this &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/contact-plos/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If APCs are preferred, or are necessary for you, they are listed in the table below. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/publish/fees/#fee-assistance&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;waiver policies and fee assistance programs&lt;/a&gt; for APCs are unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Below is a table that summarizes the information for our entire portfolio of twelve journals, with the five new journals indicated.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/©-BillionPhotos.com_-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are all aware of the effect COVID-19 has had on our day-to-day lives, but how about COVID’s effects on academia? The COVID-19 pandemic caused an outbreak of scientific evidence. As of April 2021, the number of unique publications indexed by our &lt;a href=&quot;https://zika.ispm.unibe.ch/assets/data/pub/search_beta/&quot;&gt;living evidence database&lt;/a&gt;, created to retrieve COVID-19 publications, exceeded 160,000. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01244-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;our research&lt;/a&gt;, we compared the patterns of scientific publications for the two infections, the Zika virus emergence in 2016 and SARS-CoV-2, to assess the evolution of the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The living evidence database was created initially for retrieving publications on Zika virus. In 2016, we included around 50-60 new Zika virus articles per week in our database. We thought it would be an easy transition to switch to indexing COVID-19 articles in late 2019. However, we were shocked by the sheer volume of published articles retrieved, which came to around 2,500 articles per week at the end of April 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the evidence evaluation for Zika virus, we identified and classified 2,286 publications in 2016. However, for SARS-CoV-2, although we recruited a group of international volunteer scientists with a background in health sciences to cope with the volume, we were only able to analyze a random sample of 5,294 (24%) out of 21,990 articles that were published before 24 May 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A substantial proportion of articles indexed were non-original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proportions of epidemiological study designs&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Our findings showed that a substantial proportion of articles indexed were non-original (commentaries, basic reviews, opinion papers, etc.) for both Zika virus (55%) and SARS-CoV-2 (34%, [95% Confidence interval (Cl): 33-35]). The role of preprints was more prominent at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic than the Zika virus epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case reports and case series accounted for approximately 10% of the total body of evidence for both SARS-CoV-2 (10.7% [95% CI: 9.9-11.6]) and Zika virus (9.7%) research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case-control and cohort studies accounted for 4.0% [95% CI: 3.5-4.6] for SARS-CoV-2 and 0.8% for Zika virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trials emerged in smaller numbers (27/5,294 for SARS -CoV-2, and 1/2,286 for Zika virus) and at the beginning of the outbreak, there were more mathematical modelling studies for SARS-CoV-2 (10.1%, [95% CI: 9.3-11.0]), when compared with Zika virus (3.2%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-study type trends&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Case reports, case series and cross-sectional studies were the first epidemiological study designs to be reported, together with non-original articles and reviews. Case-control and cohort studies followed later; this delay was more prominent in the Zika virus research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; laboratory studies followed between case reports and controlled observational studies. Trials were the last type of study to be published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it all mean?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Emerging infectious diseases are accompanied by a vast quantity of published evidence quickly, which is a significant challenge that clinicians, scientists, researchers, and even students have to face. Keeping up with the available evidence becomes a complicated task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed of SARS-CoV-2 evidence accumulation was unprecedented. Although we recruited a large team of experienced scientists, we reached a point where we could not categorize all the evidence retrieved by our database within the first few months of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tackle this issue, we believe the use of natural language processing methods to help classify and categorize evidence seems like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0895-4356(17)30604-2&quot;&gt;promising approach for the triage of publication&lt;/a&gt; types not only for SARS-CoV-2 but for future emerging diseases. Also, collaborative crowd-sourcing within scientists in the field could increase researchers’ efficiency and &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(13)62329-6&quot;&gt;prevent research waste&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assessing the evidence during emerging infections can help us identify which types of public health questions we can answer and when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessing the evidence during emerging infections can help us identify which types of public health questions we can answer and when. Further research on evidence evaluation during emerging outbreaks could help improve the public health response. With the accumulation of evidence during particular situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of specific resources can save time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the amount of evidence published every day on this non-ending pandemic, students, clinicians, and stakeholders need to approach the published studies with caution. Some of the studies available might be providing wrong findings or conclusions, and people might ‘cherry pick’ what aligns with their beliefs. We need critical eyes to scrutinize all available evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Shabnam Kadir will talk about a paper &quot;Feasibility of Topological Data Analysis for Event-Related fMRI&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent fMRI research shows that perceptual and cognitive representations are
instantiated in high-dimensional multivoxel patterns in the brain. However, the
methods for detecting these representations are limited. Topological data
analysis (TDA) is a new approach, based on the mathematical field of topology,
that can detect unique types of geometric features in patterns of data. Several
recent studies have successfully applied TDA to study various forms of neural
data; however, to our knowledge, TDA has not been successfully applied to data
from event-related fMRI designs. Event-related fMRI is very common but limited
in terms of the number of events that can be run within a practical time frame
and the effect size that can be expected. Here, we investigate whether
persistent homology- a popular TDA tool that identifies topological
features in data and quantifies their robustness- can identify known
signals given these constraints. We use fmrisim, a Python-based simulator of
realistic fMRI data, to assess the plausibility of recovering a simple
topological representation under a variety of conditions. Our results suggest
that persistent homology can be used under certain circumstances to recover
topological structure embedded in realistic fMRI data simulations.How do we
represent the world? In cognitive neuroscience it is typical to think
representations are points in high-dimensional space. In order to study these
kinds of spaces it is necessary to have tools that capture the organization of
high- dimensional data. Topological data analysis (TDA) holds promise for
detecting unique types of geometric features in patterns of data. Although
potentially useful, TDA has not been applied to event-related fMRI data. Here
we utilized a popular tool from TDA, persistent homology, to recover
topological signals from event-related fMRI data. We simulated realistic fMRI
data and explored the parameters under which persistent homology can
successfully extract signal. We also provided extensive code and
recommendations for how to make the most out of TDA for fMRI analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;Red sign with slogan 'Keep calm and stay home'&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12397 alignright&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/30140872-278x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;246&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;In an interesting analysis, researchers from Technical University in Munich and the University of Cambridge investigated the difference in the response to COVID-19 pandemic between Germany and UK residents. Their findings (published now in &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychology&lt;/em&gt;) highlight a striking discrepancy how responders from both countries rated the impact of the pandemic on their financial situation as well as their personal outlook: While German participants reported a lower impact in terms of loss of work and income, they were less hopeful that the pandemic would end soon compared with British participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, both populations showed an increase in symptoms of mental illnesses, most prominently depression and anxieties, induced or worsened by the pandemic. This alarming increase calls for a better public awareness of mental health and mental illness as well as better access to help in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comparison between Germany and the UK is particularly interesting because both countries are economically and culturally very similar. However, the initial response to the pandemic differed between both countries, with Germany locking down considerably earlier than the UK, which has been shown to have impacted number of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the data for this study was collected during the first lockdown in both countries (April/May 2020) it will be interesting to see how the mental health response has changed over the course of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-021-00620-8?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Medical Ethics – Research integrity, misconduct and consequences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Research ethics is a hot topic not only in the science community but is also garnering wide-spread attention among the public. Especially in recent years, cases of prominent researchers suspected of misconduct have been highly publicised across news outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12396&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12396 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-1033540402-1-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;© Warchi / Getty Images / iStock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;In a recent study published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Ethics&lt;/em&gt;, researchers from Hungary, Ireland, the UK and Norway collected and analysed data concerning cases of research misconduct available in scientific journals. Interestingly, the field of natural sciences (41.5%) was found to have the most cases in relation to number of publications in the field, followed by health and medical sciences (25.1%) and engineering (22%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The most prevalent misconduct category was fabrication and falsification of data with non-adherence to pertinent laws such as informed consent and ethics approval ranking second. Additionally, the researchers assessed the consequences for research misconduct finding paper retraction (45.4%) and exclusion from funding applications (35.5%) to be the most common sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The authors of this study further criticise that retraction notices often do not contain sufficient detail, thus impeding transparency of the retraction process. Comprehensive analyses such as this study guide the research community in finding ways to prevent misconduct and upholding research integrity standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01268-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Medical Research Methodology – Equity in clinical trial registration – Why are places of higher disease prevalence not (yet) aligned with trial locations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Clinical trials aimed to investigate treatment options for specific illnesses often do not recruit from populations with high prevalence of the respective disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12398&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Group of healthcare workers and patients of different ages and ethnicities in a huddle all with hands in smiling at the hospital.&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12398&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-1141832721-1-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;© Hispanolistic / Getty Images / iStock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;This geographical mismatch affects both the quality of care and the validity or generalisability of results and funding bodies are working towards a more equal distribution. Researchers and funding bodies are becoming increasingly aware of these issues, prompting researchers from the University of Oxford to investigate why this mismatch exists and how chief investigators (CIs) of clinical trials can be supported to achieve a more equitable distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The results of their qualitative study have now been published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Research Methodology&lt;/em&gt; revealing that the main factors in site selection for CIs is to ensure a successful trial procedure and the risk associated with choosing less research-active sites. Mainly, CIs are conscious of potential issues with patient recruitment and retention and are concerned with the effect a less successful trial might have on their reputation and future funding opportunities. This often leads to CIs selecting sites where they have a personal contact or with which they have collaborated in the past, thereby perpetuating this system of inequity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The authors suggest strategies to mitigate these perceived risk factors and incentivise chief investigators to align their research sites with the location of disease prevalence while highlighting the benefits experienced by CIs who have previously ‘broken the mould’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-021-05552-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Research Notes – Reforesting our planet using nitrogen-fixing legumes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Awareness of the importance of the tropical rain forests and forests in general for our global climate has grown over the last few years and forest restoration is crucial in our efforts to prevent a climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Reforestation programmes are on the rise, but a main hindrance to restoring a diverse plant life are often depleted soils that have lost nutrients and minerals through monocultural farming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12399&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Hand of a farmer nurturing a young green plant with natural green background .&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12399&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-614115058-1-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;© weerapatkiatdumrong / Getty Images / iStock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Brazilian researchers present data on the use of different legume plants in restoration efforts, published now in &lt;em&gt;BMC Research Notes&lt;/em&gt;. Nitrogen-fixing legumes are a useful tool to restore soils and offer a good basis for second-generation plants, but the process is often slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By measuring biomass growth of reforestation blocks treated with different fertilisation regimens, the researchers were able to show a fundamental role for additional fertilisation during the early stages of plantation development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings will be important for policymakers in setting up strategies to mitigate global warming and retrieve carbon from our atmosphere using natural fixation by plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12400&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Problem child and desperate mother at psychological centre.&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12400&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-639794730-1-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;© KatarzynaBialasiewicz / Getty Images / iStock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-021-02631-1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder leading to learning disabilities or social dysfunction in affected children with symptoms often lasting into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Previous research has shown that children with ADHD often have lower serum levels of vitamin D and magnesium, but few studies have been conducted to assess the effect of vitamin D/magnesium supplementation on behavioural issues of children diagnosed with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;In a study published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt; Hemamy and colleagues present data from a randomised, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of vitamin D/Mg supplementation on Iranian children with ADHD. Interestingly, the researchers find significant improvement in several behavioural variables including emotional and peer problems, where children in the treatment group scored significantly better than those receiving a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;This research lays the groundwork for bigger clinical trials investigating the impact of vitamin D and magnesium on the behaviour of children with ADHD as well as the underlying physiological mechanism leading to potentially new treatment recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/Module-1-screenshot-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few institutions provide training on strategies for increasing diversity among clinical trial participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many research teams struggle to recruit racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials, despite increasing awareness of the need for diversity. Unfortunately, few institutions provide training for research teams on strategies for increasing diversity among clinical trial participants. To address this need, we developed a massive open online course, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/recruitment-minorities-clinical-trials&quot;&gt;Faster Together&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the course is to help individuals involved in the clinical research enterprise (including investigators, recruiters, and clinical research coordinators), gain the knowledge and skills needed to successfully recruit and retain racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01240-x&quot;&gt;our manuscript&lt;/a&gt;, we describe the design, implementation, and initial evaluation results based on the ten-month period since the course was released. Briefly, the course was developed through a collaborative process involving a team of content experts, knowledge management information scientists, and videographers. Community feedback was incorporated throughout the course development process through consultation with the Recruitment Innovation Center Community Advisory Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/recruitment-minorities-clinical-trials&quot;&gt;course&lt;/a&gt; consists of eight modules, which can each be completed within an hour. The individual modules are divided into short (~10 minute) segments to try to make it easier for learners to complete the training when they have available time. The modules focus on topics including understanding the need for diversity in clinical research, barriers and facilitators to participation, community engagement strategies, pre-screening, consent, and retention. The course content is freely available, and learners can work at their own pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, feedback from course participants has been positive, and participants have indicated that the course increased their knowledge of the topic. It remains to be seen whether participation in the course will translate to changes in minority enrollment in clinical trials. However, the majority of learners in our study reported that they intended to alter their recruitment practices as a result of their course participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training on its own will not lead to changes, unless supplemented by actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that initiatives such as our course will ultimately result in more equitable representation of minorities in clinical trials. Achieving diversity in research participation is necessary to be able to understand whether the findings of a given study will be relevant for different populations. We recognize that training on its own will not lead to changes, unless supplemented by actions. Changes may be needed at the individual, team, and institutional levels. Responding to the call for increased diversity in clinical trial participation is one of many critical steps we can take to help reduce health disparities and promote health equity.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;To infer spike rates from calcium imaging data for a time point &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;, knowledge about the calcium signal both before and after time &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; is required. Our algorithm &lt;em&gt;Cascade&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;) uses by default a window that is symmetric in time and feeds this window into a small deep network to use the data points in the window for spike inference (schematic below taken from Fig. 2A of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt;; CC-BY-NC 4.0):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6807&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6807&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;figure-2a_mod&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-2a_mod.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-2a_mod.png?w=215&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-2a_mod.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;956,1331&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/figure-2a_mod/&quot; height=&quot;483&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-2a_mod.png?w=735&quot; width=&quot;347&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, if one wants to perform spike inference not as a post-processing step but rather during the experiment (“online spike inference”), it would be ideal to perform spike inference with a delay as short as possible. This would allow for example to use the result of spike inference for a closed-loop interaction with the animal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ringachlab.net/&quot;&gt;Dario Ringach&lt;/a&gt; recently came up with this interesting problem. With the Cascade algorithm already set up, I was curious to check very specifically: How many time points (i.e., imaging frames) are required after time point &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; to perform reliable spike inference?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using GCaMP/mouse datasets from the large ground truth database (the database is again described in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt;), I addressed this question directly by training separate models. For each model, the time window was shifted such that a variable number of data points (between minimally 1 and maximally 32) were used for spike inference. Everything was evaluated at a typical frame rate of 30 Hz, and also at different noise levels of the recordings (color-coded below); a noise level of “2” is pretty decent, while a noise level of “8” is quite noisy – explained with examples (Fig. S3) and equations (Methods) again in the preprint.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6810&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6810&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;figure-1-2&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;869,726&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/figure-1-2/&quot; height=&quot;264&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png?w=869&quot; width=&quot;317&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results are quite clear: For low noise levels (black curve, SEM across datasets as corridor), spike inference seems to reach a saturating performance (correlation with ground truth spike rates) around a value of almost 8 frames. This would result in a delay of almost 8*33 ms ≈ 260 ms after a spiking event (dashed line).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But let’s have a closer look. The above curve was averaged across 8 datasets, mixing different indicators (GCaMP6f and GCaMP6s) and induction methods (transgenic mouse lines and AAV-based induction). Below, I looked into the curve for each single dataset (for the noise level of 2).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is immediately clear that for some datasets fewer frames after &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; are sufficient for almost optimal spike inference, for others not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6812&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6812&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;figure-1-3&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;2022,665&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/figure-1-3/&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png?w=1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the best datasets, optimal performance is already reached with 4 frames (left panel; delay of ca. 120 ms). These are datasets #10 and #11, which use the fast indicator GCaMP6f, which in addition is here transgenically expressed. The corresponding spike-triggered linear kernels (right side; copied from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2&quot;&gt;Fig. S1 of the preprint&lt;/a&gt;) are indeed faster than for other datasets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two datasets with GCaMP6s (datasets #15 and #16) stand out as non-ideal, requiring almost 16 frames after &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; before optimal performance is reached. Probably, expression levels in these experiment using AAV-based approaches were very high, resulting in &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2018.09.005&quot;&gt;calcium buffering&lt;/a&gt; and therefore slower transients. The corresponding spike-triggered linear kernels are indeed much slower than for the other GCaMP6s- or GCaMP6f-based datasets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The script used to perform the above evaluations can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade/blob/master/etc/Evaluate_delay_online_spike_inference.py&quot;&gt;Cascade’s Github repository&lt;/a&gt;. Since each data point requires retraining the model from scratch, it cannot be run on a CPU in reasonable time. On a RTX 2080 Ti, the script took 2-3 days to complete.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; Only few frames (down to 4 frames) after time&lt;em&gt; t&lt;/em&gt; are sufficient to perform almost ideal spike inference. This is probably a consequence of the fact that the sharp step increase is more informative than the slow decay of a spike-triggered event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To optimize the experiment for online spike-inference, it is helpful to use a fast indicator (e.g., GCaMP6f). It also seems that transgenic expression might be an advantage, since indicator expression and calcium buffering is typically lower for transgenic expression than for viral induction, preventing a slow-down of the indicator by overexpression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce our collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://paperswithcode.com/&quot;&gt;Papers With Code&lt;/a&gt; to support links to datasets on &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning articles on arXiv now have a Code &amp;amp; Data tab to link to datasets that are used or introduced in a paper. Readers can activate Links to Code &amp;amp; Data from the paper abstract page to see links to official code, community implementations of the code, and the datasets used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_979&quot; style=&quot;width: 400px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot of links to datasets from arXiv abstract pages&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-979 size-full&quot; height=&quot;539&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/PwC-Data-Screen-Shot-2021-05-10-at-4.00.24-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;From the “Code &amp;amp; Data” tab on the arXiv article abstract page, readers can find links to datasets used in the paper.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors can add datasets to their arXiv papers by going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/login&quot;&gt;arxiv.org/user&lt;/a&gt; and clicking on the “Link to code &amp;amp; data” Papers with Code icon (see below). From there they will be directed to Papers with Code where they can add their datasets. Once added, these will show on the arXiv article’s abstract page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes tracking dataset usage across the community and quickly finding other papers using the same dataset easier. From Papers with Code, readers can discover other papers using the same dataset, track usage over time, compare models, and find similar datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All data on Papers with Code is freely available and is licensed under CC-BY-SA (same as Wikipedia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An arXivLabs Collaboration&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv’s mission is to provide an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant, emerging science and establish their contribution to advancing research. Datasets are a critical component of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second stage of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/28/arxivlabs-a-space-for-community-innovation/&quot;&gt;arXivLabs collaboration&lt;/a&gt; with Papers with Code, following &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/08/new-arxivlabs-feature-provides-instant-access-to-code/&quot;&gt;the introduction of code on arXiv&lt;/a&gt; last October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Members of our community want to contribute tools that enhance the arXiv experience, and we value that kind of community engagement,” said Eleonora Presani, arXiv Executive Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_981&quot; style=&quot;width: 926px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screen shot of arXiv user page showing icon to link to datasets on Papers with Code&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-981 size-full&quot; height=&quot;244&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-10-at-4.10.58-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;926&quot; /&gt;From the arXiv user account page, authors can click on the Papers with Code icon to link their work to relevant code and data.&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Author: &lt;strong&gt;Roheena Anand&lt;/strong&gt;, Director, Global Publishing Development, PLOS&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago we &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; five new journals and their role in our plans to spread our roots deeper and absorb researchers and local practices more fully into our business. However, this is only one part of our work in this area. In the transition to an Open future we need to keep asking ourselves “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/theme-of-2019-international-open-access-week-to-be-open-for-whom-&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open for Whom?&lt;/a&gt;” Openness in itself, while valuable, does not tackle inequality in the scholarly communications ecosystem, or increase inclusion.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we need to be intentional in addressing power imbalances and the legacy of devaluing knowledge from particular groups or regions, e.g. from communities often marginalized in North American/Western European publications, including researchers from Low-to-Middle-Income countries. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this year we will be expanding our presence into different continents, embedding ourselves into local communities to work alongside them, listening and learning, so that we can understand and reflect their needs and values.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today&lt;/strong&gt;, as our first major step, we’re sharing the wonderful news that we are formally partnering with the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tcc-africa.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Training Centre in Communication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, based in the University of Nairobi, Kenya, commonly known as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tcc-africa.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TCC Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. TCC Africa is a nonprofit trust that has been doing valuable work across the continent since 2006. They’re committed to improving African researchers’ visibility (and therefore impact) through training in scholarly communication. Like us, they are heavily invested in an Open future and work with stakeholders across the scholarly communication ecosystem to promote and increase uptake of open access and open science more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Working with TCC Africa will help us to ensure that the interests and values of African research communities are represented in PLOS publications, policies, and services and to ensure that Open Science practices work for local stakeholders. We believe that all Open Science and Open Research activities should be informed and co-created by local communities at a global scale, helping us all to rebuild the system better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve started to build our strategic plan to achieve our joint goals: it’s the first step on our path to a more inclusive Open Science future.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Nik Dennler will talk about a paper &quot;Event-Driven Sensing for Efficient Perception: Vision and Audition Algorithms&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event sensors implement circuits that capture partial functionality of
biological sensors, such as the retina and cochlea. As with their
biological counterparts, event sensors are drivers of their own
output. That is, they produce dynamically sampled binary events to
dynamically changing stimuli. Algorithms and networks that process
this form of output representation are still in their infancy, but
they show strong promise. This article illustrates the unique form of
the data produced by the sensors and demonstrates how the properties
of these sensor outputs make them useful for power-efficient,
low-latency systems working in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2021/05/12/10-years-of-brainhack-an-open-inclusive-culture-for-neuro-tool-developers-at-all-levels/"/>

		<updated>2021-05-12T09:53:12+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Brainhacks and similar formats are increasingly recognized as a new way of providing academic training and conducting research that extends traditional settings. There is a new paper out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(21)00231-2&quot;&gt;in Neuron&lt;/a&gt;, by 200+ authors, describing the format and what makes it valuable to the community. This post aims to highlight some of the core themes of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brainhacks have been held since 2012, organized by local communities, sometimes in sync with other hackathons taking place elsewhere. In 2016 the format developed into the Brainhack Global – a synchronous swarm of hybrid meetings arranged by local communities with local and virtual participants. In 2020, during the pandemic, the BG went fully virtual.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QyhV2wtej9eq5z6i1cL-fT0EGPWLrwHdjZgIbB08cnLkFLkQhWFXRyCzbzKWM52ah7uOSEJrmnbD2CSdk-Y1sDM8LsJMaaAeN_PUF_c57duNgo-8PomZvXEhqgtPsni1GdRN7VXq&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Figure 1D from &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.04.001&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.04.001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A similar growth of hackathons has occurred in communities adjacent to Brainhack. INCF started funding hackathons early because our community asked for it; and when we saw the value and inspiration hackathons brought to the community, it became a regular line item in the INCF budget. Since funding our first hackathon in 2012, we have funded or partially funded at least one hackathon each year (see our entry in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainhack.org/brainhack_jupyter_book/acknowledgments.html&quot;&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Brainhack format is inspired by the hackathon model and centers on ad-hoc, informal collaborations for building, updating and extending community software tools developed by the participants’ peers, with the goal to have functioning software by the end of the event. Unlike many hackathons, Brainhacks welcome participants from all disciplines and with any level of experience—from those who have never written a line of code to software developers and expert neuroscientists, and also feature informal dissemination of ongoing research through unconferences. Also unlike some traditional hackathons, Brainhacks do not have competitions. Brainhacks value education; recent major Brainhack events even have a TrainTrack, a set of entirely education-focused sessions that run in parallel with regular hacking on projects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;The five defining Brainhack features: &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;1) a project-oriented approach that fosters active participation and community-driven problem-solving&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2) learning by doing, which enables participants to gain more intensive training, particularly in computational methods&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3) training in open science and collaborative coding, which helps participants become more effective collaborators&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;4) focus on reproducibility, which leads to more robust scientific research; and &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;5) accelerated building and bridging of communities, which encourages inclusivity and seamless collaboration between researchers at different career stages&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brainhacks have increased insight in the value of tool usability and reusability and the need for long-term maintenance; shifting community culture from individuals creating tools for their own needs to a community actively contributing to an existing resource. They also help to disseminate good practices for writing code and documentation, ensuring code readability, using version control and licensing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brainhacks promote awareness of reproducible practices that integrate easily into research workflows, and show the value of data sharing and open data. They introduce participants to data standards, such as BIDS, allowing them to experience the benefits of a unified data organization and provides them with the skillset to use these formats in their own research. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brainhacks create a scientific culture around open and standardized data, metadata, and methods, as well as detailed documentation and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Brainhack community are currently also working to collate Brainhack-related insights and expertise into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainhack.org/brainhack_jupyter_book/&quot;&gt;Jupyter Book &lt;/a&gt; that will serve as a centralized set of resources for the community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LINKS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Maria Psarrou will talk about a paper &quot;Fast Odour Dynamics Are Encoded in the Olfactory System and Guide Behaviour&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odours are transported in turbulent plumes, which result in rapid concentration
fluctuations that contain rich information about the olfactory scenery, such as
the composition and location of an odour source. However, it is unclear whether
the mammalian olfactory system can use the underlying temporal structure to
extract information about the environment. Here we show that ten-millisecond
odour pulse patterns produce distinct responses in olfactory receptor neurons.
In operant conditioning experiments, mice discriminated temporal correlations
of rapidly fluctuating odours at frequencies of up to 40 Hz. In imaging and
electrophysiological recordings, such correlation information could be readily
extracted from the activity of mitral and tufted cells the output neurons of
the olfactory bulb. Furthermore, temporal correlation of odour concentrations
reliably predicted whether odorants emerged from the same or different sources
in naturalistic environments with complex airflow. Experiments in which mice
were trained on such tasks and probed using synthetic correlated stimuli at
different frequencies suggest that mice can use the temporal structure of
odours to extract information about space. Thus, the mammalian olfactory system
has access to unexpectedly fast temporal features in odour stimuli. This endows
animals with the capacity to overcome key behavioural challenges such as odour
source separation, figure ground segregation and odour localization by
extracting information about space from temporal odour dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;A chemistry professor at Northeastern University in Boston, MA who has almost 70 papers flagged on PubPeer resigned yesterday, May 4, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On his blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://forbetterscience.com/2020/03/19/thomas-webster-to-save-the-world-with-covid-19-nanoparticles/&quot;&gt;For Better Science&lt;/a&gt; (Update May 5, at the bottom), Leonid Schneider shared an email from the Chair of the Department of Engineering, which states that Thomas J Webster has resigned from the university. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Webster has &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Thomas+J+Webster%22&quot;&gt;69 papers flagged on PubPeer&lt;/a&gt;, mostly for concerns about image irregularities. I reported 59 to the journals and institution in March 2020. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-2562&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of these papers, which appeared to have duplications of features within the same photo, were quietly corrected. Perhaps coincidentally, these had been published in the  Elsevier journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.elsevier.com/nanomedicine-nanotechnology-biology-and-medicine/editorial-board&quot;&gt;Nanomedicine : Nanotechnology, Biology, and Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, where Webster is an Associate Editor. See e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/582FCA40E662923EAC611828E80CBE&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The apparent duplications in the colorful image on the right below this text were &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C&quot;&gt;explained by the first author on PubPeer &lt;/a&gt;as  “&lt;em&gt;the voltage of the instrument is not insufficient in that time, so that the carbon membrane (which was bought homemade) on the copper screen may affect the background and the resolution of the picture, which leads to this fuzzy image, bringing you some identification troubles&lt;/em&gt;” —  sort of blaming me for seeing these duplications. You may remember that I awarded the journal a &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2020/11/15/nanomedicine-nanotechnology-biology-and-medicine-wins-third-this-image-is-fine-award/&quot;&gt;This Image Is Fine Award&lt;/a&gt; in November 2020. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The image got replaced with something less obnoxious, without the journal even blinking when the authors wrote &lt;em&gt;“there was an inadvertent mistake for Figure 3, B which appeared as a replicated image”&lt;/em&gt;. In my professional opinion, both images contain duplicated parts — and both papers should have been retracted. But the journal had a severe conflict of interest in both cases. One of the senior authors is an Associate Editor at the journal, so the papers were not handled according to COPE guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-2567&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;2567&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm.png?w=840&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;2664,1250&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.com/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3-15-32-pm/&quot; src=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm.png?w=1024&quot; /&gt;Two examples of papers with severe image concerns, published in a journal where one of the senior author serves on the Editorial Board. In both cases, the authors were allowed to replace these figures with a clean panel, and the paper got a correction. From: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/582FCA40E662923EAC611828E80CBE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://pubpeer.com/publications/582FCA40E662923EAC611828E80CBE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several other papers with image problems were published in Dove’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dovepress.com/journal-editor-international-journal-of-nanomedicine-eic5&quot;&gt;International Journal of Nanomedicine&lt;/a&gt;, where Webster is the founding Editor-in-Chief, and not surprisingly these have not been acted upon. It is always complicated to investigate such cases if one of the authors is the founding father of the journal. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the muddy corrections at the journals, it has to be said that Northeastern University appears to have handled this case appropriately and swiftly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As reported by For Better Science, the Webster lab was suspended in November 2020, and now in May 2021 Webster has left the university. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, only 8 of these 69 papers have been corrected so far (and as we have seen above, that was not always a good decision), while as of today zero papers have been retracted. I hope the university will contact the journals with the findings of their investigation, advising them which of these cases involved research misconduct. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emily Chenette, Editor-in-Chief, PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS empowers researchers to transform science by offering more options for credit, transparency and choice. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/submit-your-lab-and-study-protocols-plos-one/&quot;&gt;launch&lt;/a&gt; of Lab Protocols and Study Protocols in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year supported this crucial goal by bringing reproducibility and transparency to research, and enabling those who contributed to study design to receive credit for their contributions.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re delighted to share the news that two Study Protocols have now been published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249435&quot;&gt;Satoru Joshita and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, describes a protocol for studying the prevalence and etiology of portopulmonary hypertension in a cohort of Japanese people with chronic liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248791&quot;&gt;John Cole and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, provides the protocol for the Copy Number Variation and Stroke (CaNVAS) Risk and Outcome study. This study aims to identify copy-number variations that are associated with a risk of ischemic stroke in diverse populations. &lt;/p&gt;


      &lt;div class=&quot; block-image-text block-image-text--left&quot; id=&quot;block-image-text--block_6092e00c8ebdc&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__image  block-image-text__image--25&quot;&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;379&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/cole-john-head.jpg&quot; width=&quot;263&quot; /&gt;
                      &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__text&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Cole writes, “Very little is known about the genetics of stroke outcome. In CaNVAS, copy number variation (CNV) variation as associated with both stroke-risk and-outcome will be explored on a large scale basis. Providing the scientific community with the CaNVAS protocol early in the study will help identify other researchers interested in these efforts, with the goal to increase collaboration and scientific discovery regarding CNV throughout the project.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    


&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, by having their Study Protocols reviewed and published, these authors have had the opportunity to ensure that their study designs are robust and reproducible before the research is completed. They’re also contributing to reducing publication bias by sharing the study aims before the results are available. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in submitting your own Study Protocol for consideration, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-study-protocols&quot;&gt;Submission Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; have more information about the submission and review process. One author-friendly feature of Study Protocols is that they are eligible for expedited review if the study has received funding after peer review from an external funding source. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also encourage researchers to share their detailed, verified research methodology by publishing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-lab-protocols&quot;&gt;Lab Protocol&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;. This unique article type was developed in partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://protocols.io&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt;, and consists of two interlinked components: 1) a step-by-step protocol on protocols.io, with access to specialized tools for communicating methodological details and facilitating use of the protocol; and 2) a peer-reviewed &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; article contextualizing the protocol, with sections discussing applications, limitations and expected results. Several Lab Protocols are under review right now, and we look forward to publishing the first article soon! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thank you to our authors, reviewers, editors and readers for contributing to these article types and supporting Open Science at &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
