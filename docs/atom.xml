&lt;p&gt;En hel dag, med några korta pauser, tog det att presentera grundpelare och huvudteman för det nya ramprogrammet för EU-forskning, Horisont Europa (#HorizonEurope). Presentationen arrangerades gemensamt av 6 stora svenska finansiärer; Energimyndigheten, FORMAS, Forte, Rymdstryrelsen, Vetenskapsrådet, och Vinnova. Många bra presentationer och panelsamtal! Jag har summerat det hela &lt;a data-id=&quot;https://wakelet.com/wake/J0Bmo2UaMo3i03wWd8WUp&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; href=&quot;https://wakelet.com/wake/J0Bmo2UaMo3i03wWd8WUp&quot;&gt;i tweets här&lt;/a&gt;, men det finns en del att lyfta upp som inte ryms i kortfattade meningar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Öppen vetenskap nämndes EN gång (av John Tumpane, från FORMAS). Data-delning nämndes inte alls. Samverkan däremot nämndes upprepade gånger, framför allt med fokus på industrin. Standarder nämndes i förbifarten, framför allt som något viktigt för industrin att bevaka och delta i utvecklandet av.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mycket av fokus låg på “partnerships”, arrangerade och finansierade strategiska multi-partssamarbeten som är menade att ge garanterad förutsägbar nytta. Hela 50% av budgeten går dit. Partnerships är inte nya för EU, men det utökade fokuset på nytta är en lite ändrad inriktning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;En nyhet för det här ramprogrammet är “&lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/info/horizon-europe/missions-horizon-europe_en&quot;&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt;“, övergripande målbilder som ska vara förankrade i samhällsbehov och ge samhällsnytta, och göra det lättare att nå målen för the European Green Deal och Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan såväl som hållbarhetsmålen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forskningsinfrastrukturer nämndes en hel del i början av samtalet (det är en av pelarna), och får en hyfsad andel av budgeten, men var inte särskilt närvarande när det kom till samverkans-diskussionen (där jag tycker de absolut passar in).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regioner nämndes som möjliga innovationshubbar och koordinatorer, vilket var en trevlig ny vinkel – tidigare har jag mest hört regioner nämnas som trösklar och fragmentering, och ett problem för det svenska Life Science-ekosystemet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Universitet nämndes i början – när vikten av rätt utbildning och mobilitet i utbildning diskuterades – men inte explicit i senare diskussioner om samverkan; där låg fokus mest på individuella forskare och på industrin. Universitet borde rimligen också vara nyckelmedlemmar i samverkansprojekt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Två viktiga gap (”valleys of death”) i kunskapsöverföring och nyttogörande  nämndes: den slingrande vägen  som krävs för att ta forskning från labbet till industrin, och svårigheten att skala upp innovativa start-ups på ett hållbart sätt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regeringen håller på och arbetar ut en nationell strategi för Sveriges deltagande i Horisont Europa, det är dock ännu oklart exakt när den kommer vara klar. Det ska bli intressant att se vad den innehåller; EU-ansökningar anses allmänt vara tunga, arbetskrävande och komplicerade. Stödbidrag för att frigöra tid att sätta ihop en ansökan vore kanske användbart. Utökat stöd från universitetens administratörer och Grant Offices också. (När jag jobbade med mitt första EU-projekt hade vi en EU-kunnig administratör till hjälp, och vilken &lt;em&gt;skillnad&lt;/em&gt; det gjorde). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tydligen hade Norge sin motsvarande presentation &lt;a data-id=&quot;https://vimeo.com/472252181/f6efee79c0&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/472252181/f6efee79c0&quot;&gt;redan i höstas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly simple measures might keep domestic cats from killing a lot of wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Estimates vary, but it’s likely that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cats-kill-more-one-billion-birds-each-year&quot;&gt;billions of birds&lt;/a&gt; and mammals succumb each year to our outdoor-ranging feline friends (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/29/13&lt;/em&gt;). Calls to keep cats indoors are often contentious among cat owners, and cats can sometimes reject colorful collars or loud bells designed to make them more noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But a meat-rich diet or a few minutes of hunting-like play each day can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)31896-0&quot;&gt;significantly reduce the amount of wildlife they bring home&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report February 11 in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interventions that reduce cat predation and have buy-in from cat owners “are so important because we’re just decimating bird populations,” says Susan Willson, an ecologist at St. Lawrence University in Canton, N.Y., who wasn’t involved in the study. While preliminary, she says this study shows that “simply feeding your cat a high-meat diet might actually work.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Most attempts to curb cats’ impact on wildlife have focused on restricting cat behavior and their ability to hunt. But Robbie McDonald, an ecologist at the University of Exeter in Cornwall, England, and his colleagues investigated the root of the problem: the urge to go out hunting in the first place. “We wanted to find out why well-fed cats might still kill wildlife,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team reasoned this urge might stem from natural instincts to hunt, or from a need for cats to supplement their diet. Cats are carnivores, and some cat foods might not be meeting all a cat’s needs, McDonald says. If either of these influence hunting behavior, then perhaps beefing up the amount of meat in a cat’s diet or mimicking hunting behavior through play could fulfill those needs without the collateral damage to wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;McDonald and his colleagues tested these new interventions on 355 domestic cats in 219 households in England’s southwest. Only known hunters were enrolled, and owners first tallied up every bird, mammal or other critter their cats brought home for seven weeks, to establish a baseline for each cat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Owners then implemented one of a handful of interventions for six weeks: switching to a grain-free, high-meat commercially available food; playing for five to 10 minutes each day; putting their cat’s normal food in a puzzle feeder; and existing methods like bells or Birdsbesafe collars. Some owners didn’t change anything, but continued tracking their cats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cats fed the meat-rich diet brought home 36 percent less prey, on average, than they did before the diet change, the team calculated. For instance, a cat that normally brings home a daily catch would instead return about 20 critters a month. “This might not seem like very much,” McDonald says of the drop. But “a very large cat population means that if this average were applied across the board, it would result in very many millions fewer deaths.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Felines treated to playtime, which consisted of owners getting their cats to stalk, chase and pounce on a feather toy and then giving cats a mouse toy to bite, returned 25 percent less prey, though that drop came mostly from mammals, not birds. Cats that started using puzzle feeders actually brought home more wildlife. Bells had no discernible effect, while cats fitted with Birdsbesafe collars brought home 42 percent fewer birds, but roughly the same number of mammals, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989415000050&quot;&gt;aligns with previous research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised diet change had such a strong effect,” McDonald says, in part because the cat’s pretreatment diets were all variable. “Nutrition seems to have some bearing on a cat’s tendency to kill things and some cats that hunt may need something extra” that’s provided by a meatier diet, he says. McDonald is already working to pinpoint what that extra something might be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a robust study that I hope is followed up with more research,” says Willson, the St. Lawrence ecologist. Because the study focused on prey brought home, it could be missing wildlife killed and eaten or left outside, she says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The surest way to prevent cats from killing wildlife is to keep them indoors, McDonald says. While many cat owners care about wildlife, they also resist such restrictions as unnatural for their cat. But McDonald found these new interventions were less controversial. After the trial, 33 percent of participants reported they planned to continue feeding their cats meat-rich diets, and 76 percent reported they’d play more with their cats. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We hope that owners of cats who hunt consider trying these changes,” McDonald says. “It’s good for conservation and good for cats.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<id>tag:biocomputation.herts.ac.uk,2021-02-11:/2021/02/11/packaging-life-the-origin-of-ion-selective-channels.html</id>
		<updated>2021-02-11T15:56:07+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Reinoud Maex will talk about a paper &quot;Packaging Life: The Origin of Ion-Selective Channels&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most articles dealing with early life focus on its chemical basis and the
evolution of proteins, RNA, DNA, and other metabolic products. This essay,
however, is concerned primarily with the energy required to produce and
maintain the essential life chemicals, and the necessity to confine them in a
cell where they can function cooperatively. It seems likely that life evolved
in proximity to the undersea vents discovered by the submersible craft Alvin
of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (Woods Hole, MA). Bacteria were
probably the original life form, growing in mats near the vents. Some
advantages of the vents as starting points for life are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;arabic simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plentiful water and essential ions. We are ~60% salt water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Plenty of chemical elements, many out of equilibrium and ready to
combine. From one point of view, chemistry is simply the search of
electrons, e.g., the two around a hydrogen molecule, for vacancies
as close as possible to a nucleus with many protons, e.g., oxygen,
or less avid electron gatherers, e.g., nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, or
phosphorus. Eighteen of the 20 AAs contain only hydrogen, carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen; and the remaining two require sulfur in
addition. DNA and RNA require, in addition, phosphorus. In short, it
is not necessary to dip far into the periodic table to make most of
the life chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Energy can be derived from combining chemicals issuing from the vent, as
in a fuel cell, which derives energy by passing electrons from
hydrogen to oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. The water near a vent is warm, speeding experiments in the evolution of
life chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these essentials, it is easy to imagine that life developed over a period
of time, say a billion years. J. D. Sutherland, who first succeeded in
synthesizing RNA, was quoted as saying: ‘‘My assumption is that we are here on
this planet as a fundamental consequence of organic chemistry.So it must be
chemistry that wants to work’’ (1). This essay starts at the point where early
chemistry has done its work. It deals with the packaging of the life chemicals,
the problems that arise from packaging, and energy production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line-block&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;h6&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Lauren Cadwallader&lt;/em&gt;, PLOS’ Open Research Manager&lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lack of reproducibility of research findings is a continuing concern in modern science.  Code reproducibility is a central part of the problem and we have been exploring code notebooks as one potential solution. We need to understand if these are of value to our community, both readers and authors of computational research, and are asking the computational research community to &lt;a href=&quot;https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6147858/Interactive-Code-Notebooks-Survey&quot;&gt;share their views&lt;/a&gt; on the most important aspects of sharing code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Collaborating on code &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have been exploring opportunities for collaboration with community-focused tools, such as code notebooks, that can improve open, reproducible research practices. PLOS Computational Biology is investigating how we can improve the reproducibility of computational articles in collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neurolibre.com/&quot;&gt;NeuroLibre&lt;/a&gt;, a Canadian-based open science group supported by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://conp.ca/&quot;&gt;Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform&lt;/a&gt;. Code notebooks are documents that contain code, the dependencies needed to run the code and reader friendly text elements, such as paragraphs of text explaining the purpose of the code block and figure captions. These notebooks can be made interactive through the ability to change parameters in figures or edit the code itself.  Notebooks improve open science practices by removing barriers faced by researchers who try to access others’ code, such as setting up the correct environment to run the code, making it simpler to interrogate code underlying the figures in a paper by presenting the code, the resulting analyses and accompanying text in a browser-based notebook. The Computational Biology community is a  logical place to explore how valuable these are since the community already shows high engagement with making code accessible, although primarily via repositories&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NeuroLibre has created prototype versions of code notebooks for two published PLOS Computational Biology articles. They took the code and data that were shared with the articles and turned them into browser-based notebooks that display the figures, with the ability to switch to view the code or to view a Jupyter notebook (hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybinder.org/&quot;&gt;Binder&lt;/a&gt;). While a base level of interactivity can be created without input from the papers’ authors, the NeuroLibre team worked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://notebook-factory.github.io/BayesianRepetoireOverlap/01Introduction/intro.html&quot;&gt;one of the papers&lt;/a&gt;’ authors to create additional interactive figures. These extra features  allow readers to manipulate the underlying data in a different way thanks to author input, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://notebook-factory.github.io/BayesianRepetoireOverlap/03Code/Fig3_final.html&quot;&gt;choosing intermediate sample sizes&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to the three sample sizes detailed in the published paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;351&quot; src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/T4Do4lvQDevPbvaG4UopRqwqvmDvHN-WRwMSmv9sg6LPkdMsP_YXlPMwTSJvosvBiDDbXgzqkAxS0qtJQAt2nccCVENPh00dD3XeKDvT6blBtadYqbZkMse6_m1UFtNcLGGnhq-c&quot; width=&quot;624&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The sample size in the interactive plot can be changed using the dropdown box to the top left of the plot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;What are we up to?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our collaboration with NeuroLibre to date has focused on gathering qualitative user feedback on the prototypes, to understand  the value of these notebooks to computational biology researchers. A series of seven initial interviews helped us to better understand how researchers currently manage and share their code, how and why they access other peoples’ code, and if we are asking the right questions about notebooks. Amongst other things, we are interested in hearing what aspects of publishing reproducible research researchers value the most, what challenges they encounter, and what considerations there are for creating an interactive notebook alongside a published paper. Informed by the outcomes of this initial research, we are now looking for more researchers to share their views on these prototypes via an online questionnaire. This will serve as useful feedback for NeuroLibre to continue improving their tools, and support PLOS in working towards improving reproducibility in research publishing, in collaboration with the scientific community. &lt;br /&gt;If you work in computational biology related research, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6147858/Interactive-Code-Notebooks-Survey&quot;&gt;share your views&lt;/a&gt;! Anonymous results of the survey will be made available in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This next workshop series of 2021 will bring together non-invasive neuroimaging tool developers, neuroscientists, engineers, and industry partners to discuss emerging tools and pathways for disseminating current imaging technologies. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please join us on Feb. 18 and 19, and March 9-11!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-3028&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent advancements in electromagnetic recording, molecular imaging, and other non-invasive brain imaging modalities have allowed researchers to examine the human brain with incredible sensitivity and specificity. Now, it is critical to evaluate how these tools will benefit the future of human neuroscience research. Starting next week, the NIH BRAIN Initiative is hosting a two-part virtual workshop series on non-invasive neuroimaging technologies. As mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/strategic-planning/acd-working-groups/brain-initiative%C2%AE-20-cells-circuits-toward-cures&quot;&gt;BRAIN 2.0 reports&lt;/a&gt;, these workshops will convene experts in neuroimaging from academia and industry to discuss the broader dissemination and transformative potential of new imaging tools in neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshops are open to anyone and will be livestreamed on NIH Videocast. You can view them live &lt;a href=&quot;https://videocast.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on the day of each event.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/11/psychological-impact-of-a-relationship-ending-is-reflected-in-language-of-reddit-users-going-through-break-ups/"/>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While some relationships are ended in the heat of the moment, for many the decision to break up with a partner involves several long, agonising weeks of weighing up various options. During that time, your attitudes and behaviours towards your partner may change — you might become colder or more distant, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what about your language? According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/7/e2017154118&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, the language we use on social media just prior to a break-up can offer a key insight into the emotional and cognitive impacts of a relationship ending. Looking at over a million posts from 6,803 Reddit users who had posted on r/BreakUps, the University of Austin team found changes in language that were so consistent they could even be found in posts completely unrelated to relationships at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41361&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the forum, some users open up about why they’re thinking of ending their relationship, or ask advice from fellow posters about particular situations. Other users have been broken up &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt;, using the space to vent and express their sorrow or rage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team looked at the language of forum users for evidence for two types of thinking: cognitive processing and analytic thinking. Cognitive processing is the kind of thinking people do while trying to understand particular problems that they know very little about. Language related to cognitive processing can be grouped by insight words like “understand”, causal words like “because” or “result”, and words related to self-discrepancy like “should”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Analytic thinking, on the other hand, involves logical (sometimes even dispassionate) reasoning about a certain situation, reflected in factual rather than emotional language. The researchers also considered the focus of people’s posts: whether they were oriented around the self, with frequent use of “I”, or around a collective “we”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team used a text analysis system that calculated the percentage of words corresponding to these different dimensions of language, both before and after they had posted about their break-up, and both within r/BreakUps and elsewhere on Reddit. First, a pre-break-up baseline period was established, from a year to four months before the break-up; during this period, there were no significant changes in language. Language was then analysed in two week intervals until a year after the break-up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found significant decreases in analytic thinking a month before the break-up, not returning to baseline levels until six months after the break-up. This suggests a serious disruption in people’s “normal” thinking patterns, starting up to three months before a break-up. The sharpest drop in analytic thinking came at the disclosure of the break-up, with people’s language becoming the most personal and informal in the immediate aftermath of their relationship ending. This remained true even when they were not talking about their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while analytic thinking &lt;em&gt;decreased&lt;/em&gt;, language related to cognitive processing &lt;em&gt;increased&lt;/em&gt;. Use of “I” and “we” words also increased, peaking at the time of the break-up. The effect was largest, unsurprisingly, for “I” words — and again, held even when users were posting about topics completely unrelated to their break-up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though “we” words returned to their baseline levels within a month, analytic thinking and “I” words remained heightened for up to 14 weeks post-break-up. The team suggests that this shows people “continue to be self immersed” even if they have worked through their break-up and divorced themselves from their identity as part of a couple. When, through cognitive processing, people’s stories become more “developed and organised”, as the authors put it, analytic language starts to increase once again; overall, language patterns remained significantly different from baseline until around six months after the break-up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So could writing about your break-up online help you deal with it better? Well, it’s complicated. While expressively writing about your emotions has been associated with higher levels of wellbeing, those who were long-term posters on r/BreakUps were less likely to return to baseline levels of language than those who had only posted once or twice. However, it was unclear whether these users had something else in common that affected their thinking and language, such as a cognitive style or personality trait.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It would also be interesting to look more deeply at the norms and jargons of particular forums and how these affect the way people write. Take another relationship-based subreddit, r/Relationships. Browsing the subreddit, you’ll often see the same kinds of language, structure and tone across posts, a standard way for people to write about their problems and challenges (often to fairly incongruous and amusing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/redditships&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;). Looking at the culture of individual forums could also give some insight into why and when people use the language they do, and how that language use relates to their own conceptualisation of their thoughts, feelings and lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/7/e2017154118&quot;&gt;Language left behind on social media exposes the emotional and cognitive costs of a romantic breakup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Gertrude the pig rooted around a straw-filled pen, oblivious to the cameras and onlookers — and the 1,024 electrodes eavesdropping on her brain signals. Each time the pig’s snout found a treat in a researcher’s hand, a musical jingle sounded, indicating activity in her snout-controlling nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those beeps were part of the big reveal on August 28 by Elon Musk’s company Neuralink. “In a lot of ways, it’s kind of like a Fitbit in your skull with tiny wires,” said Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, of the new technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists have been recording nerve cell activity from animals for decades. But the ambitions of Musk and others to link humans with computers are shocking in their reach. Future-minded entrepreneurs and researchers aim to listen in on our brains and perhaps even reshape thinking. Imagine being able to beckon our Teslas with our minds, Jedi-style.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some scientists called Gertrude’s introduction a slick publicity stunt, full of unachievable promises. But Musk has surprised people before. “You can’t argue with a guy who built his own electric car and sent it to orbit around Mars,” says Christof Koch, a neuroscientist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;images of gertrude the pig and her brain signals&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096192&quot; height=&quot;354&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021321_LS_brain-kavli_inline-1-680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096192&quot;&gt;Whenever Gertrude’s snout touched something, nerve cells in her brain fired electrical signals detected by an implanted device (signals shown as wavy lines on black). Similar technology may one day help people with paralysis or brain disorders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096192&quot;&gt;Neuralink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether Neuralink will eventually merge brains and Teslas is beside the point. Musk isn’t the only dreamer chasing neurotechnology. Advances are coming quickly and span a variety of approaches, including external headsets that may be able to distinguish between hunger and boredom; implanted electrodes that translate intentions to speak into real words; and bracelets that use nerve impulses for typing without a keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mind-motion&quot;&gt;paralyzed people are already testing brain-computer interfaces&lt;/a&gt;, a technology that connects brains to the digital world (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/16/13, p. 22&lt;/em&gt;). With brain signals alone, users have been able to shop online, communicate and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/paralyzed-woman-grips-sips-coffee-robot-arm&quot;&gt;even use a prosthetic arm to sip from a cup&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/16/12, p. 5&lt;/em&gt;). The ability to hear neural chatter, understand it and perhaps even modify it could change and improve people’s lives in ways that go well beyond medical treatments. But these abilities also raise questions about who gets access to our brains and for what purposes.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Readers’ thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We asked members of the public for their take on the ethics of new brain technology. A sampling of their quotes are on the following pages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-pullquote&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The thoughts of someone accessing a person’s brain is absolutely terrifying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-pullquote&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have no wish/desire to be a zombie or a clone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of neurotechnology’s potential for both good and bad, we all have a stake in shaping how it’s created and, ultimately, how it is used. But most people don’t have the chance to weigh in, and only find out about these advances after they’re a fait accompli. So we asked &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt; readers their views about recent neurotechnology advances. We described three main ethical issues — fairness, autonomy and privacy. Far and away, readers were most concerned about privacy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea of allowing companies, or governments, or even health care workers access to the brain’s inner workings spooked many respondents. Such an intrusion would be the most important breach in a world where privacy is already rare. “My brain is the only place I know is truly my own,” one reader wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Technology that can change your brain — nudge it to think or behave in certain ways — is especially worrisome to many of our readers. A nightmare scenario raised by several respondents: We turn into zombies controlled by others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When these types of brain manipulations get discussed, several sci-fi scenarios come to mind, such as memories being wiped clean in the poignant 2004 film &lt;em&gt;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&lt;/em&gt;; ideas implanted into a person’s mind, as in the 2010 movie &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt;; or people being tricked into thinking a virtual world is the real thing, as in the mind-bending 1999 thriller &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today’s tech capabilities are nowhere near any of those fantasies. Still, “the here and now is just as interesting … and just as morally problematic,” says neuroethicist Timothy Brown of the University of Washington in Seattle. “We don’t need &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; to get our dystopia.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image alignwide size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;illustration of scientists on a ladder removing thought bubbles from a brain&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096190&quot; height=&quot;515&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021321_LS_brain-kavli_inline-3-1030.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1030&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096190&quot;&gt;The ability to nudge brain activity in certain directions raises ethical questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096190&quot;&gt;Julia Yellow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, codes of ethics and laws govern research, medical treatments and certain aspects of our privacy. But we have no comprehensive way to handle the privacy violations that might arise with future advances in brain science. “We are all flying by the seat of our pants here,” says Rafael Yuste, a neurobiologist at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, ethics questions are being taken up in a piecemeal way. Academic researchers, bioethicists and scientists at private companies, such as IBM and Facebook, are discussing these questions among themselves. Large brain-research consortiums, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-shot&quot;&gt;such as the U.S. BRAIN Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/22/14, p. 16&lt;/em&gt;), include funding for projects that address privacy concerns. Some governments, including Chile’s national legislature, are starting to address concerns raised by neurotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With such disjointed efforts, it’s no surprise that no consensus has surfaced. The few answers that exist are as varied as the people doing the asking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Electrode bracelet&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-columns&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bracelet studded with electrodes can detect tiny nerve impulses on the wrist. The bracelet (shown) uses electromyography, which picks up the behavior of nerve cells that control muscles, to eavesdrop on signals that move from the brain to hand muscles. Developed by New York City–based CTRL-Labs, a neural interface company acquired by Facebook Reality Labs in 2019, the bracelet allows users to play chess in a virtual room, control a hand avatar and type with tiny movements from inside a pocket, for instance, without a keyboard, mouse or touch screen. The technology is still in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;electrode bracelet&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096188&quot; height=&quot;608&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021321_LS_brain-kavli_inline-5-680.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096188&quot;&gt;CTRL-Labs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Reading thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ability to pull information directly from the brain — without relying on speaking, writing or typing — has long been a goal for researchers and doctors intent on helping people whose bodies can no longer move or speak. Already, implanted electrodes can record signals from the movement areas of the brain, allowing people to control robotic prostheses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In January 2019, researchers at Johns Hopkins University implanted electrodes in the brain of Robert “Buz” Chmielewski, who was left quadriplegic after a surfing accident. With signals from both sides of his brain, Chmielewski controlled two prosthetic arms to use a fork and a knife simultaneously to feed himself, researchers announced in a press release on December 10.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Robert “Buz” Chmielewski, who has had quadriplegia since his teens, uses brain signals to feed himself some cake. Via electrodes implanted in both sides of his brain, he controls two robotic arms: One manipulates the knife and the other holds the fork.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other research has decoded speech from the brain signals of a paralyzed man who is unable to speak. When the man saw the question, “Would you like some water?” on a computer screen, he responded with the text message, “No, I am not thirsty,” using only signals in his brain. This feat, described November 19 at a symposium hosted by Columbia University, is another example of the tremendous progress under way in linking brains to computers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Never before have we been able to get that kind of information without interacting with the periphery of your body, that you had to voluntarily activate,” says Karen Rommelfanger, a neuroethicist at Emory University in Atlanta. Speaking, sign language and writing, for instance, “all require several steps of your decision making,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, efforts to extract information from the brain generally require bulky equipment, intense computing power and, most importantly, a willing participant, Rommelfanger says. For now, an attempt to break into your mind could easily be thwarted by closing your eyes, or wiggling fingers, or even getting drowsy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, Rommelfanger says, “I don’t believe that any neuroscientist knows what a mind is or what a thought is,” she says. “I am not concerned about mind reading, from the existing terrain of technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But that terrain may change quickly. “We are getting very, very close” to having the ability to pull private information from people’s brains, Yuste says, pointing to studies that have decoded what a person is looking at and what words they hear. Scientists from Kernel, a neurotech company near Los Angeles, have invented a helmet, just now hitting the market, that is essentially a portable brain scanner that can pick up activity in certain brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, companies have only our behavior — our likes, our clicks, our purchase histories — to build eerily accurate profiles of us and estimate what we’ll do next. And we let them. Predictive algorithms make good guesses, but guesses all the same. “With this neural data gleaned from neurotechnology, it may not be a guess anymore,” Yuste says. Companies will have the real thing, straight from the source.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even subconscious thoughts might be revealed with further technological improvements, Yuste says. “That is the ultimate privacy fear, because what else is left?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Laser helmets&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-columns&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A helmet sends laser beams through the skull and into the brain. After bouncing off tissue and blood, the particles of light return to detectors that measure oxygen levels. Those levels indicate where in the brain nerve cells are active, thus giving clues about mental processes. This technology, called functional near-infrared spectroscopy, is the same that allows pulse oximeters to measure oxygen levels in the blood. In early 2021, the neurotechnology company Kernel, based near Los Angeles, began selling Kernel Flow helmets (shown) to researchers who are using the tools to study concussions, language and even dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;laser helmet&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096189&quot; height=&quot;807&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021321_LS_brain-kavli_inline-4-680.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096189&quot;&gt;Kernel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Rewrite, revise&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Technology that can change the brain’s activity already exists today, as medical treatments. These tools can detect and stave off a seizure in a person with epilepsy, for instance, or stop a tremor before it takes hold.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers are testing systems for obsessive-compulsive disorder, addiction &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-electric-implants-treat-depression-closer-reality&quot;&gt;and depression&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/16/19, p. 22&lt;/em&gt;). But the power to precisely change a functioning brain directly — and as a result, a person’s behavior — raises worrisome questions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The desire to persuade, to change a person’s mind, is not new, says Marcello Ienca, a bioethicist at ETH Zurich. Winning hearts and minds is at the core of advertising and politics. Technology capable of changing your brain’s activity with just a subtle nudge, however, “brings current manipulation risks to the next level,” Ienca says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-pullquote alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Imagine walking into McDonald’s and suddenly you have an irresistible urge for a cheeseburger (or 10).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What happens if such influence finds a place outside the medical arena? A doctor might use precise brain-modifying technology to ease anorexia’s grip on a young person, but the same might be used for money-making purposes: “Imagine walking into McDonald’s and suddenly you have an irresistible urge for a cheeseburger (or 10),” one of our readers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Is the craving caused by real hunger? Or is it the result of a tiny neural nudge just as you drove near the golden arches? That neural intrusion could spark uncertainty over where that urge came from, or perhaps even escape notice altogether. “This is super dangerous,” Yuste says. “The minute you start stimulating the brain, you are going to be changing people’s minds, and they will never know about it, because they will interpret it as ‘that’s me.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Precise brain control of people is not possible with existing technology. But in a hint of what may be possible, scientists have already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/manipulating-nerve-cells-makes-mice-see-something-not-there&quot;&gt;created visions inside mouse brains&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/17/19, p. 10&lt;/em&gt;). Using a technique called optogenetics to stimulate small groups of nerve cells, researchers made mice “see” lines that weren’t there. Those mice behaved exactly as if their eyes had actually seen the lines, says Yuste, whose research group performed some of these experiments. “Puppets,” he calls them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image alignwide size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;illustration of scientists observing the inside of a brain&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096186&quot; height=&quot;686&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021321_LS_brain-kavli_inline-7-1030.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1030&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096186&quot;&gt;Once researchers or companies can change our brain activity, will neural privacy require special protections? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096186&quot;&gt;Julia Yellow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;What to do?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As neurotechnology marches ahead, scientists, ethicists, companies and governments are looking for answers on how, or even whether, to regulate brain technology. For now, those answers depend entirely on who is asked. And they come against a backdrop of increasingly invasive technology that we’ve become surprisingly comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We allow our smartphones to monitor where we go, what time we fall asleep and even whether we’ve washed our hands for a full 20 seconds. Couple that with the digital breadcrumbs we actively share about the diets we try, the shows we binge and the tweets we love, and our lives are an open book.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those details are more powerful than brain data, says Anna Wexler, an ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania. “My e-mail address, my notes app and my search engine history are more reflective of who I am as a person — my identity — than our neural data may ever be,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-pullquote alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“How would we know that what we thought or felt came from our own brains, or whether it was put there by someone else?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s too early to worry about privacy invasions from neurotechnology, Wexler argues, a position that makes her an outlier. “Most of my colleagues would tell me I’m crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the spectrum, some researchers, including Yuste, have proposed strict regulations around privacy that would treat a person’s neural data like their organs. Much like a liver can’t be taken out of a body without approval for medical purposes, neural data shouldn’t be removed either. That viewpoint has found purchase in Chile, which is now considering whether to classify neural data with new protections that would not allow companies to get at it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other experts fall somewhere in the middle. Ienca, for example, doesn’t want to see restrictions on personal freedom. People ought to have the choice to sell or give away their brain data for a product they like, or even for straight up cash. “The human brain is becoming a new asset,” Ienca says, something that can generate profit for companies eager to mine the data. He calls it “neurocapitalism.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;section class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-callout&quot;&gt;
	

	&lt;source media=&quot;(min-width: 768px)&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;source /&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;background&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/themes/sciencenews/client/src/images/cta-module-sm@2x.jpg&quot; /&gt;


	&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-callout__container&quot;&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;What would you like to tell the scientists working in this area? Send your thoughts to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:feedback@sciencenews.org?subject=Can%20privacy%20coexist%20with%20technology%20that%20reads%20and%20changes%20brain%20activity%3F&quot;&gt;feedback@sciencenews.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And Ienca is fine with that. If a person is adequately informed — granted, a questionable if — then they are within their rights to sell their data, or exchange it for a service or product, he says. People ought to have the freedom to do what they like with their information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;General rules, checklists and regulations are not likely to be a good path forward, Rommelfanger says. “Right now, there are over 20 frameworks, guidelines, principles that have been developed since 2014 on how to handle neuroscience,” she says. Those often cover “mental privacy” and “cognitive liberty,” the freedom to control your own mental life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those guidelines are thoughtful, she says, but the technologies differ in what they’re capable of, and in their possible ethical repurcussions. One-size-fits-all solutions don’t exist, Rommelfanger says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Under-skull implants&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thin tendrils laced with hundreds or thousands of electrodes will spread out in the brain to listen in on — and perhaps even stimulate — nerve cells. So far, Elon Musk’s company Neuralink, based in Fremont, Calif., has tried the method on rats and pigs in the lab. Other labs are testing implanted electrodes in people with paralysis. To make the surgery less risky and more efficient, Neuralink is building a robot that can quickly sew the electrode threads (shown attached to a charging disk) into the brain, ultimately linking people with computers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Neuralink under-skull implant&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096187&quot; height=&quot;304&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021321_LS_brain-kavli_inline-6-680.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096187&quot;&gt;Neuralink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, each company or research group may need to work through ethical issues throughout the development process. She and colleagues have recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdfExtended/S0896-6273(18)30823-7&quot;&gt;proposed five questions&lt;/a&gt; that researchers can ask themselves to begin thinking about these ethical issues, including privacy and autonomy. The questions ask people to consider how new technology might be used outside of a lab, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moving forward on the technology to help people with mental illness and paralysis is an ethical imperative, Rommelfanger says. “More than my fear of a privacy violation, my fear is about diminished public trust that could undermine all of the good this technology could do.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A lack of ethical clarity is unlikely to slow the pace of the coming neurotech rush. But thoughtful consideration of the ethics could help shape the trajectory of what’s to come, and help protect what makes us most human.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is an initiative to provide a ready to use Fedora based Free/Open source software platform for neuroscience.
We believe that similar to Free software, science should be free for all to use, share, modify, and study.
The use of Free software also aids reproducibility, data sharing, and collaboration in the research community.
By making the tools used in the scientific process easier to use, NeuroFedora aims to take a step to enable this ideal.
In this session, I will talk about the deliverables of the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; project and then go over the complete pipeline that we use to produce, test, and disseminate them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/obese-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have several anti-smoking policies in the UK in recent decades – the bans on indoor/workplace smoking, tobacco adverts around sports, and tobacco sales in vending machines, to name a few. Indeed, smoking has been the major target of public health interventions, and rightfully so given that it made the largest contribution to avoidable deaths. These public health interventions have been quite successful and, as a result, the number of smokers has been decreasing over the past 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more people with obesity and fewer who smoke, it is now of question whether smoking remains the top contributor to UK’s deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while smoking became less popular, we had more people with obesity. In 2003, 23% of people in England had obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and the number rises to 29% in 2017. Similar trends can also be observed in other nations in the UK. With more people with obesity and fewer who smoke, it is now of question whether smoking remains the top contributor to UK’s deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We answered this question in our research by synthesizing two sets of numbers. The first set is the yearly proportions of people with different levels of obesity, and those of current, former, and never smokers. We extracted these numbers from the Health Surveys for England and Scottish Health Surveys. These surveys recruited random samples of people in England and Scotland, making their findings more representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second set of numbers is what we called the risk ratios of obesity and smoking. Risk ratios quantify to which extent people with obesity and smokers are at higher risk of adverse health events, such as death. We extracted risk ratios from the latest meta-analysis studies, which should provide more robust estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12249&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12249&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/picblog-300x250.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Frederick K Ho et. al BMC Public Health&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining these two sets of numbers, we found that smoking contributed 23% of all deaths in 2003, and that number decreased to 19% in 2017 (Figure). Meanwhile obesity contributed 18% deaths in 2003 and that number increased to 23% in 2017. The contribution of obesity exceeded that of smoking in 2013. The general trends were consistent across age, sex, and education level. But for younger people under 45 years of age, smoking remained the larger contributor to deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should, however, be noted that the analysis assumed the risk ratios could accurately reflect the extent to which obesity and smoking causes death over the 15 years. In addition, our study only considered deaths, but the impact of obesity and smoking extends to chronic illnesses and disabilities. The legacy of smoking, such as vaping, electronic cigarettes, and passive smoking, have also not been accounted for. These can be further investigated when better and more recent data are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our analysis estimated obesity is now contributing to more deaths than smoking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historical efforts to protect the public from the harms of smoking have been successful. Our analysis estimated obesity is now contributing to more deaths than smoking, which highlights the need to focus our efforts to address it. This could include government policies and legislation to create an environment that can facilitate weight management, as well as interventions to support individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-seashell-conch-shell-horn-humans-cave-art"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Ancient Europeans made a horn out of a large seashell and blew musical notes out of it roughly 18,000 years ago, a new study suggests. While it’s not known how ancient people used the shell horn, conch shells in historical and modern cultures have served as musical instruments, calling or signaling devices and sacred or magical objects, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People played the marine horn inside Marsoulas Cave, located in the French Pyrenees, say archaeologist Carole Fritz, of the University of Toulouse in France, and her colleagues. Wall paintings inside that cave depict humans, animals and geometric forms. Discoverers of the conch shell at the cave’s entrance in 1931 thought it had been used as a shared drinking container.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But microscopic and imaging examinations indicate that &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/7/eabe9510&quot;&gt;someone cut off the shell’s narrow end to create a small opening&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists report February 10 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;. A cylindrical mouthpiece, possibly a hollow bird bone, was inserted in the hole, they suspect. Brownish traces of a resin or wax around the artificial opening may have come from a glue for the mouthpiece.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Images of the shell’s interior revealed two holes that had been chipped into spiral layers just beneath the opening, likely to hold the mouthpiece in place. By using a metal mouthpiece and blowing into the shell’s artificial opening, a musicologist and horn player enlisted by the researchers produced sounds close to the musical notes C, C sharp and D.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seashell solo&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recording of an approximately 18,000-year-old conch shell that was made into a horn demonstrates the sounds it could have made. The tones are close to the musical notes C, D and C sharp.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;Ancient shell sounds&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-audio&quot;&gt;&lt;audio controls=&quot;controls&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021021_ancientshellhornsounds.mp3&quot;&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Red pigment marks shaped like human fingerprints dot the inside of the shell, near its wide opening where someone trimmed the edge. If the shell horn was used as a musical instrument, it’s certainly not the oldest. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-flutes-found-germany&quot;&gt;That honor goes to bone and ivory flutes &lt;/a&gt;that Europeans made as early as around 40,000 years ago (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/24/09&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/drop-cfc-emissions-hole-ozone-layer-back-on-track-closing"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Good news for the ozone layer: After a recent spike in CFC-11 pollution, emissions of this ozone-destroying chemical are on the decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emissions of trichlorofluoromethane, or CFC-11, were supposed to taper off after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/nations-ban-ozone-harming-compounds&quot;&gt;Montreal Protocol banned CFC-11 production&lt;/a&gt; in 2010 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/7/90&lt;/em&gt;). But 2014 to 2017 saw an unexpected bump. About half of that illegal pollution was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/emissions-banned-ozone-destroying-chemical-have-been-traced-china&quot;&gt;pegged to eastern China&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/22/19&lt;/em&gt;). Now, atmospheric data show that global CFC-11 emissions in 2019 were back down to the average levels seen from 2008 to 2012, and about 60 percent of that decline was due to reduced emissions in eastern China, two teams report online February 10 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-ozone-hole-top-science-stories-2016&quot;&gt;hole in Earth’s ozone layer&lt;/a&gt; is still on track to close up within the next 50 years — rather than being delayed, as it would have been if CFC-11 emissions had remained at the levels seen from 2014 to 2017 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/14/16&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One group analyzed the concentration of CFC-11, used to make insulating foams for buildings and household appliances, in the air above atmospheric monitoring stations around the globe. The team found that the world emitted about 52,000 metric tons of CFC-11 in 2019 — a major drop from the annual average of 69,000 metric tons from 2014 to 2018. The 2019 emissions were comparable to the average annual emissions from 2008 to 2012, Stephen Montzka, an atmospheric chemist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo., and colleagues report.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Back on track   &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Atmospheric observations from Gosan, South Korea, and Hateruma, Japan, suggest that annual CFC-11 emissions in eastern China (measured in nanograms per meter squared per second) were higher on average from 2014 to 2017 (center) than they were from 2008 to 2012 (left), but dropped back down to pre-2013 levels in 2019 (right).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;Changes in CFC-11 emissions over eastern China, 2008–2019&lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;graph of CFC-11 emissions over eastern China from 2008 to 2019&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096318&quot; height=&quot;382&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/020921_MT_CFC_inline1_desktop.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096318&quot;&gt;AGAGE/NASA Earth Observatory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;graph of CFC-11 emissions over eastern China from 2008 to 2019&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096319&quot; height=&quot;440&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/020921_MT_CFC_inline1_mobile.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096319&quot;&gt;AGAGE/NASA Earth Observatory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new measurements imply that there has been a significant decrease in illicit CFC-11 production within the last couple of years, the researchers say, probably thanks to more rigorous regulation enforcement in China and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another group confirmed that emissions from eastern China have diminished since 2018 by analyzing air samples from Hateruma, Japan, and Gosan, South Korea. The region emitted about 5,000 metric tons of CFC-11 in 2019, which was about 10,000 metric tons less than its average annual emissions from 2014 to 2017 and was similar to the 2008 to 2012 average. That analysis was led by Sunyoung Park, a geochemist at Kyungpook National University in Daegu, South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The recent downturn in CFC-11 pollution shows that “the Montreal Protocol is working,” says A.R. “Ravi” Ravishankara, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins not involved in either study. When someone violates the treaty, “atmospheric sleuthing” can uncover the culprits and spur countries to take action, he says. “China clearly took action, because you can see the result of that action in the atmosphere.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Montzka cautions that it might not always be so easy to point the finger at rogue emitters. “I think we got lucky this time,” he says, because atmospheric monitoring sites in Asia were able to trace the bulk of illegal emissions to eastern China and monitor the situation over several years. Many places around the world, such as in Africa and South America, lack atmospheric monitoring stations — so it’s still a mystery which countries besides China were responsible for the recent rise and fall of CFC-11 emissions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Climate change is a cause of serious concern for many — but that doesn’t mean anxiety about the planet is always at the top of people’s agendas. As we reported last year, the effectiveness of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/11/16/climate-change-appeals-may-be-more-effective-when-theyre-pessimistic/&quot;&gt;climate change appeals&lt;/a&gt; can vary considerably. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959378011000173&quot;&gt;other research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that worries about the environment can be displaced by other issues (fewer Americans reported concern about climate change after the 2008 financial crisis, for example). This latter phenomenon is known as the “finite pool of worry” hypothesis: that as some concerns creep up our radar, others become neglected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So with COVID-19 taking up space both in the media and in our minds, are people thinking less about climate change? According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/3/e2018936118.short?rss=1&quot;&gt;new study in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the answer is no: climate change is now such a major concern that even serious threats of another nature don’t diminish fears at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41352&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research conducted in April 2020 &lt;a href=&quot;https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-april-2020/&quot;&gt;in the US&lt;/a&gt; and in May 2019 to 2020 &lt;a href=&quot;https://cast.ac.uk/publications/&quot;&gt;in the UK&lt;/a&gt; first indicated that concerns about COVID-19 might be pushing out worries about the climate. But these studies suffered from small sample sizes, so in the new work Darrick Evensen from the University of Edinburgh and team looked at data from 1,858 UK participants taking part in a longitudinal study over the course of fourteen months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants indicated how much they believed climate change was real and caused by humans by responding to five statements such as “I am convinced that climate change is really happening” and “the media is often too alarmist about issues like climate change”. They also indicated how serious a threat they felt climate change was to themselves and their own family, to the UK as a whole, to people in developing countries, and to wildlife and ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than belief in or concern about climate change &lt;em&gt;diminishing &lt;/em&gt;over the fourteen month period, participants’ belief only seemed to strengthen: there was slightly more agreement in June 2020 that climate change was both real and caused by humans than there was at the start of the study (although the authors point out that the sizes of these effects were very small).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked whether COVID-19 was a bigger threat than climate change to the UK, the virus was seen to be very slightly more of a threat (43% compared to 42%). On a wider scale, however, this gap increased: 45% of participants saw climate change as a bigger threat to Europe (compared to 40% who saw COVID-19 as a bigger threat) and 55% saw climate change as a bigger threat to the world (versus 33% for COVID-19).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite such widespread concern, media coverage of climate change may not be making the impact one might hope. Participants were asked whether they had heard of several environment-related stories covered extensively in the news: youth climate strikes, Extinction Rebellion protests, the UK Climate Assembly, and wildfires in Australia, storms in the UK and melting glaciers in the Alps and Greenland. Increased knowledge of such stories did not have a significant correlation with how participants’ perception of  climate change severity changed over the 14 months — suggesting that media coverage itself is not increasing people’s concern about (or willingness to do something to combat) climate change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the team looked at around 124 million tweets sent from the UK to identify whether climate change or COVID-19 was receiving more attention from users. In this case, COVID-19 did seem to have an impact, with tweets about climate change decreasing during the period between March 2019 to August 2020. This may be related to how newsworthy the virus was — being concerned about something doesn’t necessarily mean tweeting about it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results suggest that the finite pool of worry hypothesis does not stand up when it comes to climate change. The team suggests that since prior research on the topic, the environment may have become a “permanent member of more people’s pool of worry” — something that just doesn’t budge, even when other concerns dominate. This may be good news: if we’re thinking about climate change we’re more likely to want to do something about it, whether on personal or structural levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lack of correlation between media coverage and perceived climate change severity, however, may need further research. If news stories about climate change aren’t making a difference, then what is? If not the media, what has altered people’s “pools of worry” so significantly since previous research? Exploring the answers to these questions could provide insights to campaigners, politicians and journalists alike.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/3/e2018936118.short&quot;&gt;– Effect of “finite pool of worry” and COVID-19 on UK climate change perceptions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 Chemosphere has issued an expression of concern for a 2019 paper on microplastics in the ocean with an uncomfortable degree of similarity to a previously published article in another journal. However, the editors decided that they could find enough daylight between the two papers that leaving their version unretracted was “barely justified” — a less-than-hearty … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2021/02/10/editors-decide-not-to-retract-microplastics-article-but-they-feel-that-it-is-barely-justified/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Editors decide not to retract microplastics article but “they feel that it is barely justified”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;For most of their lives, plants in the &lt;em&gt;Sapria&lt;/em&gt; genus are barely anything — thin ribbons of parasitic cells winding inside vines in Southeast Asian rainforests. They become visible only when they reproduce, bursting from their host as a dinner plate–sized flower that smells like rotting flesh.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, new research on the genetic instruction book of this rare plant reveals the lengths to which it has gone to become a specialized parasite. The findings, published January 22 in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;, suggest that at least one species of &lt;em&gt;Sapria&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.12.045&quot;&gt;lost nearly half of the genes&lt;/a&gt; commonly found in other flowering plants and stolen many others directly from its hosts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The plant’s rewired genetics echo its bizarre biology. &lt;em&gt;Sapria&lt;/em&gt; and its relatives in the family Rafflesiaceae have discarded their stems, roots and any photosynthetic tissue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you’re out in the forest in Borneo and these [plants] aren’t producing flowers, you’re never even going to know they’re there,” says Charles Davis, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;For years, Davis has been studying the evolution of this group of otherworldly parasites, which includes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/biggest-bloom-superflower-changes-branch-family-tree&quot;&gt;largest flower in the world, &lt;em&gt;Rafflesia arnoldii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/10/07&lt;/em&gt;). When some genetic data showed a close relationship between these parasites and their vine hosts, Davis suspected horizontal gene transfer. That’s where genes move directly from one species to another — in this case, from host to parasite. But no one had yet deciphered the genome — the full genetic instruction book — for these plants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So Davis and his team sequenced many millions of pieces of &lt;em&gt;Sapria himalayana&lt;/em&gt;’s genome, assembling them into a cohesive picture. When the team analyzed the genome, they found an abundance of oddities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About 44 percent of the genes found in most flowering plants were missing in &lt;em&gt;S. himalayana&lt;/em&gt;. Yet, at the same time, the genome is about 55,000 genes long, more than that of some other nonparasitic plants. The count is inflated by many repeating segments of DNA, the team found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Loss of the chlorophyll pigments responsible for photosynthesis is common in parasitic plants that rely on their hosts for sustenance. But &lt;em&gt;S. himalayana&lt;/em&gt; appears to have even scrapped all genetic remnants of its chloroplasts, the cellular structures where photosynthesis occurs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chloroplasts have their own genome, distinct from the nuclear genome that runs a plant’s cells and the mitochondria that produce energy for the cells. &lt;em&gt;S. himalayana &lt;/em&gt;seems to have lost this genome altogether, suggesting that the plant has purged the last remnants of its ancestral life that allowed it to make its own food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is no other case” of an abandoned chloroplast genome among plants, says Davis. Earlier work by other researchers had suggested &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/31/4/793/1110087&quot;&gt;that the genome may be missing&lt;/a&gt;. “Our work clearly verifies that indeed it’s totally gone,” he says, noting that even genes in &lt;em&gt;S. himalayana&lt;/em&gt;’s nuclear genome that would regulate components of the chloroplast genome have vanished. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It may be too early to declare the chloroplast genome completely missing in action, cautions Alex Twyford, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved with this research. It may be difficult to definitively prove the genome is gone, he says, especially if the chloroplast is “unusual in its structure or abundance” and therefore difficult to identify.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the remaining parts of the nuclear genome, the team also found that more than 1 percent of &lt;em&gt;S. himalayana&lt;/em&gt;’s genome comes from genes stolen from other plants, likely its current and ancestral hosts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The potential scale of the vanished genome and the volume of repeating bits of DNA are “insane,” says Arjan Banerjee, a biologist at the University of Toronto Mississauga also not involved with this study. The “industrial scale” of the plant’s gene theft is also impressive, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are still plenty of weird elements left in &lt;em&gt;S. himalayana&lt;/em&gt;’s genome to explore, says study coauthor Tim Sackton, an evolutionary biologist also at Harvard. For example, the plant has bloated its genome with extraneous DNA, while most parasites streamline their genomes. “There’s something weird and different going on in this species,” he says, adding that many of the DNA fragments the parasitic plant is stealing from its host don’t appear to encode any genes, and likely don’t do anything important.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new discovery illustrates the level of commitment &lt;em&gt;S. himalayana&lt;/em&gt; and its relatives have given to evolving a parasitic lifestyle, and provide a comparison to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parasitic-plant-consists-flashy-flowers-creepy-suckers&quot;&gt;other extreme plant parasites&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/31/20&lt;/em&gt;). And for Davis, plants like &lt;em&gt;S. himalayana&lt;/em&gt; can help researchers determine some of biology’s limits. These plants have lost half their genes, yet they still survive, he notes. “Maybe these organisms that stretch the boundaries of existence tell us something about how far the rules can be bent before they can be broken.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a book!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As some of you may know, in summer of 2018 I signed a contract with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/non-fiction/popular-science/&quot;&gt;Bloomsbury Sigma&lt;/a&gt; to write a book about my area of research: computational neuroscience. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the term has many definitions, computational neuroscience is mainly about applying mathematics to the study of the brain. The brain—a jumble of all different kinds of neurons interconnected in countless ways that somehow produce consciousness—has been described as “the most complex object in the known universe”. Physicists for centuries have turned to mathematics to properly explain some of the most seemingly simple processes in the universe—how objects fall, how water flows, how the planets move. Equations have proved crucial in these endeavors because they capture relationships and make precise predictions possible.&lt;strong&gt; How could we expect to understand the most complex object in the universe without turning to mathematics? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The answer is we can’t, and that is why I wrote this book. While I’ve been studying and working in the field for over a decade, most people I encounter have no idea what “computational neuroscience” is or that it even exists. Yet a desire to understand how the brain works is a common and very human interest. I wrote this book to let people in on the ways in which the brain will ultimately be understood: through mathematical and computational theories.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I know that both mathematics and brain science are on their own intimidating topics to the average reader and may seem downright prohibitory when put together. That is why I’ve avoided (many) equations in the book and focused instead on the driving reasons why scientists have turned to mathematical modeling, what these models have taught us, and how some surprising interactions between biologists, physicists, mathematicians, and engineers over centuries have laid the groundwork for the future of neuroscience.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each chapter of &lt;em&gt;Models of the Mind&lt;/em&gt; covers a separate topic in neuroscience, starting from individual neurons themselves and building up to the different populations of neurons and brain regions that support memory, vision, movement and more. These chapters document the history of how mathematics has woven its way into biology and the exciting advances this collaboration has in store. &lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-designer-molecules-quantum-device-qubit"/>

		<updated>2021-02-09T22:18:39+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Quantum bits made from “designer molecules” are coming into fashion. By carefully tailoring the composition of molecules, researchers are creating chemical systems suited to a variety of quantum tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The ability to control molecules … makes them just a beautiful and wonderful system to work with,” said Danna Freedman, a chemist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. “Molecules are the best.” Freedman &lt;a href=&quot;https://aaas.confex.com/aaas/2021/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/27848&quot;&gt;described her research&lt;/a&gt; February 8 at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, held online.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quantum bits, or qubits, are analogous to the bits found in conventional computers. But rather than existing in a state of either 0 or 1, as standard bits do, qubits can possess both values simultaneously, enabling new types of calculations impossible for conventional computers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Besides their potential use in quantum computers, molecules can also serve as quantum sensors, devices that can make extremely sensitive measurements, such as sussing out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/single-atom-can-gauge-teensy-electromagnetic-forces&quot;&gt;minuscule electromagnetic forces&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/23/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In Freedman and colleagues’ qubits, a single chromium ion, an electrically charged atom, sits at the center of the molecule. The qubit’s value is represented by that chromium ion’s electronic spin, a measure of the angular momentum of its electrons. Additional groups of atoms are attached to the chromium; by swapping out some of the atoms in those groups, the researchers can change the qubit’s properties to alter how it functions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recently, Freedman and colleagues crafted molecules to fit one particular need: molecular &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6522/1309.abstract&quot;&gt;qubits that respond to light&lt;/a&gt;. Lasers can set the values of the qubits and help read out the results of calculations, the researchers reported in the Dec. 11 &lt;em&gt;Science.&lt;/em&gt; Another possibility might be to create molecules that are biocompatible, Freedman says, so they can be used for sensing conditions inside living tissue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Molecules have another special appeal: All of a given type are exactly the same. Many types of qubits are made from bits of metal or other material deposited on a surface, resulting in slight differences between qubits on an atomic level. But using chemical techniques to build up molecules atom by atom means the qubits are identical, making for better-performing devices. “That’s something really powerful about the bottom-up approach that chemistry affords,” said Freedman.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists are already using individual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-are-about-get-real&quot;&gt;atoms and ions&lt;/a&gt; in quantum devices (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/29/17&lt;/em&gt;), but molecules are more complicated to work with, thanks to their multiple constituents. As a result, molecules are a relatively new quantum resource, Caltech physicist Nick Hutzler said at the meeting. “People don’t even really know what you can do with [molecules] yet.… But people are discovering new things every day.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A flash flood surged down a river in India’s Himalayan Uttarakhand state on February 7, killing at least 30 people and washing away two hydroelectric power stations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As rescue workers search for more than 100 people who are still missing, officials and scientists are trying to unravel the causes of the sudden flood. Did a glacier high up in the mountains collapse, releasing a huge plug of frigid meltwater that spilled into the river? Or was the culprit a landslide that then triggered an avalanche? And what, if any, link might these events have to a changing climate?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are three things to know about what might have caused the disaster in Uttarakhand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;1. One possible culprit was the sudden break of a glacier high in the mountains.&lt;/h4&gt;





&lt;p&gt;News reports in the immediate wake of the disaster suggested that the floodwaters were caused by the sudden overflow of a glacial lake high up in the mountain, an event called a glacial lake outburst flood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s likely too early to know what exactly happened,” says Anjal Prakash, the research director of the Bharti Institute of Public Policy at the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad. Satellite images show that a section of a glacier broke off, but how that break relates to the subsequent floods is still unknown. One possibility is that the glacier was holding back a lake of meltwater, and that heavy snowfall in the region two days earlier added enough volume to the lake that the water forced its way out, breaking the glacier and surging into nearby rivers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This scenario is certainly in line with known hazards for the region. “These mountains are very fragile,” says Prakash, who was also a lead author on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 2019 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ipcc.ch/report/srocc/&quot;&gt;special report on oceans and the cryosphere&lt;/a&gt;, Earth’s icy places. But, he notes, there isn’t yet much on-the-ground data to help clarify events. “The efforts are still focused on relief at the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;2. A landslide may be to blame instead.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other researchers contend that the disaster wasn’t caused by a glacial lake outburst flood at all. Instead, says Daniel Shugar, a geomorphologist at the University of Calgary in Canada, satellite images snapped during the disaster show the telltale marks of a landslide: a dark scar snaking through the white snow and clouds of dust clogging the air above. “You could see this train of dust in the valley, and that’s common for a very large landslide,” Shugar says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“WOW,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WaterSHEDLab/status/1358442899713662977?s=20&quot;&gt;he wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; the morning of February 7, posting side-by-side satellite shots of a dark area of possible “massive dust deposition,” contrasted against the same snowy, pristine region just the day before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Before and after the massive flood in India’s Himalayan state of Uttarakhand&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These satellite images were taken at the same location on February 6, before the flood (left) and after, on February 7 (right). The path of the flood starts at the bottom right of the Feb. 7 image and snakes toward the upper left, passing through the Tapovan Hydropower Plant near the upper left corner. The dark debris deposits along the path, as well as the still-settling clouds of dust, are telltale signs of a landslide, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096290&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/020921_cg_indiaglacier_inline_desktop.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096290&quot;&gt;Planet Labs Inc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096291&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/020921_cg_indiaglacier_inline_mobile.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096291&quot;&gt;Planet Labs Inc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Landslides — the sudden failure of a slope, sending a rush of rocks and sediment downhill — can be triggered by anything from an earthquake to an intense deluge of rain. In high, snowy mountains, cycles of freezing and thawing and refreezing again can also begin to break the ground apart; the ice-filled cracks can slowly widen over time, setting the stage for sudden failure, and then, disaster.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The satellite images seem to point clearly to such a landslide, rather than a typical glacial lake overflow, Shugar says. The force of the landslide may have actually broken off that piece of hanging glacier, he says. Another line of evidence against a sudden lake burst is that “there were no lakes of any size visible” in the satellite images taken over the region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, an outlying question for this hypothesis is where the floodwaters came from. It might be that one of the rivers draining down the mountain was briefly dammed by the rockfall; a sudden release of that dam could send a large plug of water from the river swiftly and disastrously downhill. “But that’s a pure guess at the moment,” Shugar says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;3. It’s not yet clear whether climate change played a role in the disaster.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The risk of both glacial lake outburst floods and freeze-thaw-related landslides in Asia’s high mountains has increased due to climate change. At first glance, “it was a climate event,” Prakash says. “But the data are still coming.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The region, which includes the Hindu Kush Himalayan mountains and the Tibetan Plateau, “has been a climate change hot spot for a pretty long time,” Prakash says. The region is often called Earth’s third pole, because the stores of ice and snow in the Himalayan watershed amount to the largest reserves of freshwater outside of the polar regions. The region is the source of 10 major river systems that provide water to almost 2 billion people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Climate change reports have warned that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/himalayan-glacier-melting-threatens-water-security-millions-people&quot;&gt;warming is not only threatening this water supply&lt;/a&gt;, but also increasing the likelihood of natural hazards (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/29/19&lt;/em&gt;). In the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 2019 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-how-climate-change-already-altering-oceans-ice-future&quot;&gt;special report on oceans and the cryosphere&lt;/a&gt;, scientists noted that glacier retreat, melting snow and thawing permafrost are making mountain slopes more unstable and also increasing the number of glacial lakes, upping the likelihood of a sudden, catastrophic failure (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/25/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 2019 comprehensive assessment &lt;a href=&quot;https://lib.icimod.org/record/34383&quot;&gt;focusing on climate change’s impacts&lt;/a&gt; in Asia’s high mountains found that the glaciers in the region have retreated much more quickly in the last decade than was anticipated, Prakash says, “and that is alarming for us.” Here’s another way to look at it: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cold-war-spy-satellite-images-himalayan-glaciers-rapid-melting&quot;&gt;Glaciers are retreating twice as fast&lt;/a&gt; as they were at the end of the 20th century (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/19/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-81212-9&quot;&gt;Glacier-related landslides in the region have also become increasingly common&lt;/a&gt; in the last decade, as the region warms and destabilizing freeze-thaw cycles within the ground occur higher and higher up on the slopes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in the case of this particular disaster, Shugar says, it’s just hard to say conclusively at this point what role climate change might have played, or even what specific event might have triggered a landslide. “Sometimes there is no trigger; sometimes it’s just time,” he says. “Or it’s that we just don’t understand the trigger.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;’s array of publication options that push the boundaries of Open Science continues to expand. We’re happy to announce two new article types that improve reproducibility and transparency, and allow researchers to receive credit for their contributions to study design: &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/protocols/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lab Protocols &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Study Protocols&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These new article types complement other Open Science developments at &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/01/submit-your-registered-report-to-plos-one/&quot;&gt;Registered Reports&lt;/a&gt;, and support PLOS’ mission to accelerate progress in science and medicine. Adding reliable and accessible methods that can be built upon to the scientific record, Lab and Study Protocols support robust, reproducible science.  As reproducible science helps accelerate discoveries, such contributions deserve notice. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Protocols&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consisting of a single article published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, Study Protocols describe detailed plans and proposals for research projects that have not yet generated results. Sharing a study’s design and analysis plan before the research is conducted improves research quality by reducing the potential for bias, and credits researchers for the work that occurs prior to data collection. Additionally, studies that were peer reviewed as part of the funding process can be eligible for expedited publication. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Already well-established in health-related fields, we’re opening the format to the natural sciences, medicine, and engineering, as well as the related social sciences and humanities. In fact, both Lab and Study Protocols are open to submissions within &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;’s inclusive &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information#loc-scope&quot;&gt;scope&lt;/a&gt;, and are subject to our normal &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication&quot;&gt;publication criteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lab and Study Protocols from &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; provide new opportunities for researchers to gain more recognition for the work that goes into contributing detailed methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fplos.io%2FProtocolsIsHere&amp;amp;text=Lab%20and%20Study%20Protocols%20from%20@PLOSONE%20provide%20new%20opportunities%20for%20researchers%20to%20gain%20more%20recognition%20for%20the%20work%20that%20goes%20into%20contributing%20detailed%20methods.&amp;amp;hashtags=PLOSProtocols&quot;&gt;Share on Twitter! &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lab Protocols&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developed with researchers and in partnership with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://protocols.io&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt; team, Lab Protocols consist of two interlinked components that together describe &lt;em&gt;verified&lt;/em&gt;, reusable methods:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A step-by-step protocol on protocols.io, with access to specialized tools for communicating methodological details and facilitating use of the protocol, including reagents, measurements, formulae, video clips and dynamic flow charts. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;A peer-reviewed &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; article contextualizing the protocol, with sample datasets and sections discussing applications, limitations and expected results. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This two-part setup provides the best of both worlds for authors: the detailed, step-by-step guidance is held on protocol.io’s flexible open access platform, and the article in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE &lt;/em&gt;helps increase the visibility and discoverability of the protocol by making it an official part of the peer-reviewed publication record. The partnership with protocols.io supports authors by clearly communicating technical details in a user-friendly format to support reproducibility. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Access from the PLOS ONE article to protocols.io is seamless, via uniquely-created and clearly marked features of both platforms. The protocol and accompanying article are peer reviewed by subject experts. The method described in a Lab Protocol must have been shown to work in at least one peer-reviewed publication, so readers can be confident that the Lab Protocol will work as described.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lab Protocols are now open to submissions reporting verified methodologies and computational techniques.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it look like? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The protocol on protocols.io and the article on &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; work together to communicate details required to reproduce a study.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-18683&quot; height=&quot;1020&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/2021-02-08-14_57_29-PLOS-Protocols-PLOS-1024x1020.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the left is the protocol on protocols.io. With the details—steps—of the protocol portrayed through interactive features and special tools, authors can effectively communicate complicated lab instructions. On the right is the &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; article, providing context, assurance of peer review, and increased visibility for the protocol. Both elements of a Lab Protocol will be interlinked and available simultaneously, with peer review of both organised by &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; and its community of Academic Editors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuing to improve methods papers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks to our partnership with protocols.io, we’re able to offer authors enhanced functionality to share their protocols alongside the features from a peer-reviewed publication. We believe that researchers will really benefit from the dynamic functionality that protocols.io provides, helping pave the way for improved methods papers and increased reproducibility across disciplines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To help those who are trying protocols.io for the first time, authors of Lab Protocols at &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE &lt;/em&gt;can receive free support from the protocols.io editorial team to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocols.io/we-enter-protocols&quot;&gt;upload and format their protocols&lt;/a&gt; as part of the publication process in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ready to submit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To submit a Lab or Study Protocol, view &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;‘s &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication&quot;&gt;publication criteria&lt;/a&gt; and submit your article through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submit-now&quot;&gt;journal website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Note: The Copyright Clearance Center issued the following press release on their&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.copyright.com/plos-adopts-copyright-clearance-centers-rightslink-for-scientific-communications-to-manage-new-community-action-publishing-model/&quot;&gt; site &lt;/a&gt;earlier today&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot;&gt;The Public Library of Science&lt;/a&gt; (PLOS) announced today it is using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyright.com/publishers/rightslink-scientific/&quot;&gt;RightsLink® for Scientific Communications&lt;/a&gt; (RLSC) to manage its &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot;&gt;Community Action Publishing&lt;/a&gt; (CAP) model, which aims to eliminate author APCs in order to make  its OA journals truly Open to Read and Open to Publish.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are the first PLOS journals live on RLSC, the comprehensive scholarly communications workflow solution from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyright.com/&quot;&gt;Copyright Clearance Center, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; (CCC), a leader in advancing copyright, accelerating knowledge, and powering innovation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RLSC is used by PLOS to deliver a flexible, sophisticated workflow that enables authors to easily publish OA, whether or not they are funded under a formal PLOS publishing agreement. PLOS can also leverage the agreement management capabilities of RLSC to support emerging OA models such as the University of California multi-payer model, where the university and author share responsibility for funding APCs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We want to ensure all authors have the same freedom in choosing the best venue for their research,” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. “PLOS’ Community Action Publishing changes the way we think about selectivity and authorship for a more equitable OA future. Key to this is a friction-free author experiences that reduces the lift for authors around managing payments. RLSC has been critical to facilitating this.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re so pleased PLOS chose RLSC to support its new CAP model by automating the management, collection, and funding of manuscripts,” said Emily Sheahan, Vice President and Managing Director, Information and Content Services, CCC.  “In partnering with PLOS on this important initiative, CCC helps provide the scale and automation required to support the needs of a growing community of stakeholders.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS recently entered into agreements with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.btaa.org/&quot;&gt;Big Ten Academic Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crkn-rcdr.ca/en/home&quot;&gt;Canadian Research Knowledge Network&lt;/a&gt;,  premier higher education consortiums of top-tier research institutions in North America, for its members to participate in the CAP program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CCC just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.copyright.com/copyright-clearance-centers-rightslink-for-scientific-communications-increases-awareness-of-available-open-access-publication-funding-upon-manuscript-submission/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; new functionality for RLSC, including a capability to inform authors of available OA publication funding throughout the manuscript lifecycle, starting with submission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RLSC enables publishers, funders and institutions to support a variety of OA agreements. It accelerates the implementation of OA deals, including Read and Publish Agreements, Membership Deals, and more. Over 30 publishers rely on CCC’s sophisticated agreement management solution to serve over 800 global academic institutions, consortia, and funders – including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jisc.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;Jisc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mpg.de/en&quot;&gt;Max Planck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdlib.org/&quot;&gt;California Digital Library&lt;/a&gt;. CCC’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyright.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Open-Access-Workflow-Services_Service-Sheet_November-2020.pdf&quot;&gt;Open Access Workflow Services&lt;/a&gt;, a comprehensive consulting practice providing strategic OA institutional agreement workflow support, helps organizations deliver on each agreement’s unique needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CCC is an active partner in the information industry’s evolution of hybrid and pure Open Access publishing models. For years CCC has brought together key Open Access stakeholders from the author, publisher, institution, funding, and vendor communities through roundtables, panel events, webinars, podcasts, and published pieces. CCC is a member of &lt;a href=&quot;https://oaspa.org/&quot;&gt;OASPA&lt;/a&gt; (Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alpsp.org/&quot;&gt;ALPSP&lt;/a&gt; (Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stm-assoc.org/&quot;&gt;STM&lt;/a&gt; (International Association of STM Publishers) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sspnet.org/&quot;&gt;SSP&lt;/a&gt; (Society for Scholarly Publishing).&lt;/p&gt;

 Last year, Naunyn-Schmiedeberg’s Archives of Pharmacology found itself on the receiving end of what its editor Roland Seifert called a “massive attack of fraudulent papers” that were the product of paper mills.  In response Seifert — who says the journal ultimately will have retracted 10 of those articles and stopped another 30 from being published … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2021/02/09/20-ways-to-spot-the-work-of-paper-mills/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;20 ways to spot the work of paper mills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/ourmembers&quot;&gt;Member institutions&lt;/a&gt; now have &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_usage&quot;&gt;a new way to view their arXiv usage data&lt;/a&gt;. On arXiv.org, the number of downloads by institution is provided in searchable tables and graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universities, libraries, and research institutes want to support the platforms, tools, and resources that are most valuable to their constituents. By providing various types of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_usage&quot;&gt;usage statistics&lt;/a&gt;, arXiv aims to help members and other stakeholders understand arXiv’s value, as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_886&quot; style=&quot;width: 974px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_usage&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot of institutional downloads by subject area&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-886 size-full&quot; height=&quot;847&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/AccessDownloadStats-1.png&quot; width=&quot;974&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Institutions can now view their usage statistics this way. To search for a specific domain, hover over the area designated with the purple arrow to reveal the search icon.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To download your institution’s data, you can visit the following links. Select the institution or domain of interest, then click download, as indicated by the purple arrows in the screenshot below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://tableau.cornell.edu/#/views/arXiv2020byInstitution/arXiv2020ByInstitution?:iid=1&quot;&gt;2020 Total Downloads by Institution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://tableau.cornell.edu/views/arXiv2020byInstitutionArchive/Sheet1&quot;&gt;2020 Downloads by Institution by Subject Archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://tableau.cornell.edu/#/views/arXivInstUsage/InstitutionByYear2?:iid=2&quot;&gt;Downloads by Institution (2009 – 2020)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_909&quot; style=&quot;width: 945px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot of member downloads with arrows to download function&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-909 size-full&quot; height=&quot;386&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/Member-Downloads-Tableau-Screen-Shot-2021-02-09.png&quot; width=&quot;945&quot; /&gt;To download the data, select the url or institution of interest, then click “download,” as indicated by the purple arrows in this screenshot.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our community knows, arXiv is open, above all. Readers can access articles without logging in. Authors need only meet minimal requirements to submit articles. This central tenet of openness makes measuring usage by specific communities challenging. The usage presented in the new format is compiled from data based on institutional domains and IP address ranges, and it does have limitations. For example, most people access arXiv from locations other than their research libraries. Providing new ways to view usage data is an ongoing process and feedback is always welcome at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:membership@arXiv.org&quot;&gt;membership@arXiv.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv’s 243 members and affiliates worldwide support the organization by contributing about 25% of the operating budget, fulfilling the Simons Foundation matching funds requirement, and contributing to governance through the Member Advisory Board. If your institution is a member, thank you! For organizations that are not yet members, we encourage you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/membership&quot;&gt;learn more about membership&lt;/a&gt; and consider supporting arXiv’s mission to provide an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant, emerging science, and establish their contribution to advancing research.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you’re going through a period of anxiety or depression it can be difficult to make decisions, whether those are significant life changes or more mundane, everyday choices about prioritising tasks or time management. And those with generalised anxiety disorder or mood disorders often report feeling uncomfortable with or distressed by feelings of uncertainty — which doesn’t help when you need to make a decision, big or small.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/61387&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;, Christopher Gagne from UC Berkeley and colleagues find that people with higher levels of anxiety and depression are less able to adapt to fast-changing situations. But the authors suggest that with the right intervention there may be ways to not only mitigate this distress, but to help those with anxiety or depression make better decisions in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41340&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were aged between 18 and 55; some had diagnoses of generalised anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder, some had &lt;em&gt;symptoms&lt;/em&gt; of both or either disorder but no formal diagnosis, while others had no history of mental illness at all. Those taking medication were excluded from the study, as were those with other diagnoses including OCD, PTSD and bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, after filling in measures related to anxiety, depression, worry and personality, 86 participants took part in a video game. In each round, they were asked to choose between two shapes: picking one shape resulted in a small monetary reward, while the other delivered an electric shock ranging from mild to moderate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The task took place in two blocks — one stable, in which one shape was associated with a reward 75% of the time and the other 25% of the time, and one volatile, in which the shape with a higher probability of resulting in reward switched every twenty trials. In the volatile blocks, therefore, the participants had to keep adjusting their responses as the probabilities change..&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those participants who either had a diagnosis of depression or anxiety, or who exhibited higher levels of associated symptoms, were slower to adjust their responses to the changes in probabilities. This suggests that mood disorders are associated with difficulties making decisions in changing circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second experiment replicated the first — only this time, instead of being shocked when they chose the wrong shape, participants lost money. And, again, results showed that those with symptoms of anxiety or depression were slower to adapt to changing rules in the face of unpredictability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean for those with anxiety and depression when faced with a big decision? Senior author Sonia Bishop &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/12/22/in-shaky-times-focus-on-past-successes-if-overly-anxious-depressed/&quot;&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; that those participants who adapted quickly did so because of their emotional resilience. “Emotionally resilient people tend to focus on what gave them a good outcome, and in many real-world situations that might be key to learning to make good decisions,” she says. Bishop’s previous research has found similar results: in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25730669/&quot;&gt;one 2015 study&lt;/a&gt;, those with anxiety were more likely to make mistakes in decision-making in rapidly changing circumstances, while those with low levels of anxiety were able to quickly adapt to the task.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team suggests that cognitive-based therapies which encourage people to focus on past successes rather than failures could therefore be a useful behavioural intervention, making those difficult decisions that bit less tricky.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/61387&quot;&gt;Impaired adaptation of learning to contingency volatility in internalizing psychopathology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;When it comes to finding fossils of very ancient microbial life — whether on Earth or on other worlds, such as Mars — the odds are just not in our favor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Actual microbial life-forms are much less likely to become safely fossilized in rocks compared with nonbiological structures that happen to mimic their shapes, new research finds. The finding suggests that Earth’s earliest rocks &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/doi/10.1130/G48152.1/594307/Organic-biomorphs-may-be-better-preserved-than&quot;&gt;may contain abundant tiny fakers&lt;/a&gt; — minuscule objects masquerading as fossilized evidence of early life — researchers report online January 28 in &lt;em&gt;Geology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The finding is “at the very least a cautionary tale,” says study author Julie Cosmidis, a geomicrobiologist at the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tiny, often enigmatic structures found in some of Earth’s oldest rocks, dating back to more than 2.5 billion years, can offer tantalizing hints of the planet’s earliest life. And the hunt for ever-more-ancient signs of life on Earth &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-signs-early-life-inspires-dueling-teams-greenland-together&quot;&gt;has sparked intense debate&lt;/a&gt; — in part because the farther back in time you go, the harder it is to interpret tiny squiggles, filaments and spheres in the rock (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/3/20&lt;/em&gt;). One reason is that the movements of Earth’s tectonic plates over time can squeeze and cook the rocks, deforming and chemically altering tiny fossils, perhaps beyond recognition.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But an even more pernicious and contentious problem is that such tiny filaments or spheres may not be biological in origin at all. Increasingly, scientists have found that nonbiological chemical processes can create similar shapes, suggesting the possibility of “false positives” in the biological record.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One such discovery led to the new study, Cosmidis says. A few years ago, she and others were trying to grow bacteria and make them produce sulfur. “We were mixing sulfides with organic matter, and we started forming these objects,” she says. “We thought they were formed by the bacteria, because they looked so biological. But then we realized they were forming in laboratory tubes that happened to have no bacteria in them at all.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That led her to wonder about such processes happening in the rocks themselves. So she and others decided to examine what would happen if they tried to re-create the early formation stages of chert, a kind of compact, silica-rich rock common on the early Earth. “Microfossils are often found in chert formations,” says study coauthor Christine Nims, a geobiologist now at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “Anything hosted in [chert] will be well-preserved.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chert forms out of silica-rich water; the silica precipitates out of the water and accumulates, eventually hardening into rock. Cosmidis, Nims and colleagues added sulfur-containing bacteria called &lt;em&gt;Thiothrix&lt;/em&gt; to solidifying chert to see what might happen during actual fossilization. To other chert samples, they added sulfur-containing “biomorphs,” spheres and filaments made of tiny crystals but shaped like bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At first, nanoparticles of silica encrusted the bacteria and the biomorphs, Nims says. But after a week or so, the bacteria started to deform, their cells deflating from cylinders into flattened, unrecognizable ribbons as the sulfur inside the cells diffused out and reacted with the silica outside the cells, forming new minerals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biomorphs, on the other hand, “had this impressive resiliency,” she says. Although they, too, lost sulfur to the surrounding solution, they kept their silica crust. As a result, “they kept their shape and showed very little change over time.” That endurance suggests that enigmatic structures found in the early rock record have a better chance of being pseudofossils, rather than actual fossils, the team says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;biomorphs vs. microbial fossils&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096240&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/020521_cg_fossils_inline1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;679&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096240&quot;&gt;In a new study, researchers produced twisted filament-shaped biomorphs (top) from the reactions of sulfide with prebiotic organic compounds. The biomorphs resemble possible microbial fossils (bottom, filaments indicated by red arrows) found in rocks dating to 3.5 billion years ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096240&quot;&gt;From top: C. Nims; R.J. Baumgartner &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Geology&lt;/em&gt; 2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that once-living creatures are harder to preserve makes sense, says Sean McMahon, an astrobiologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the new study. “It’s not totally surprising,” he says. “We know that biomass does tend to break down quite quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, scientists have known for centuries that &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2019.2410&quot;&gt;certain chemical reactions can act as “gardens”&lt;/a&gt; that “grow” strange-shaped mineral objects, twisting into tubes or sprouting branches or otherwise mimicking the weirdness of life. “There’s a complacency about it, a misconception that we kind of know all this and it’s already been dealt with,” McMahon says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Strategies to deal with this conundrum have included looking for particular structures — such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/early-life-ancient-fossils-stromatolites-microbes-debate&quot;&gt;mound-shaped stromatolites&lt;/a&gt; — or chemical compounds in a potential fossil that are thought to be uniquely formed or modified by the presence of life (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/17/18&lt;/em&gt;). Those criteria are the product of decades of field studies, through which scientists have amassed a vast reference dataset of fossil structures, against which researchers can compare and evaluate any new discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Anything we find, we can look at through that lens,” McMahon says. But what’s lacking is a similarly rich dataset for how such structures might form in the &lt;em&gt;absence&lt;/em&gt; of life. This study, he says, highlights that attempts “to define criteria for recognizing true fossils in very ancient rocks are premature, because we don’t yet know enough about how nonbiological processes mimic true fossils.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s an increasingly urgent problem with rising stakes, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-instruments-life&quot;&gt;NASA’s Perseverance rover&lt;/a&gt; is about to set down on Mars to begin a new search for traces of life in ancient rocks (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/28/20&lt;/em&gt;), he adds. “Paleontologists and Mars exploration scientists should take [this study] very seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Gratitude is widely regarded as a positive emotion. When we feel grateful, we are more helpful, generous and fair to others — findings that were supported by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-16711-001&quot;&gt;2017 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, which concluded that gratitude is important for building relationships. But now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-99648-001&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt; suggests that gratitude has a dark side. Specifically, people who felt more grateful were more willing to accede to an instruction to prepare as many worms as possible for grinding to their death. As Eddie M. W. Tong at the National University of Singapore and his colleagues write: “The findings suggest that gratitude can make a person more vulnerable to social influence, including obeying commands to perform a questionable act.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41333&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team started with a study of 96 student participants, who individually recalled and wrote about either a happy event or an occasion on which they’d felt grateful (or their morning routine; an emotionally neutral event). After then rating their current feelings of gratitude and happiness, each participant was led to a coffee grinder and 20 little cups, each of which contained a live mealworm. The experimenter — a final year student who kept things formal and avoided small talk — switched on the grinder, to demonstrate that it worked, and said: “What I want you to do now is to pour as many worms as you can within 30 seconds into this grinder to grind the worms.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What the participants were not told was that a stopper was inserted part way down, so that the worms could not drop to the blades. (“No worms were harmed,” the team notes.) Anyone who objected was “sternly” instructed to continue with the task. (Across four studies with a total of 623 participants, only one refused to insert any worms; all participants were fully debriefed afterwards.) The team found that participants who’d reported feeling more grateful packed in more worms than those who felt happier, suggesting that it was gratitude, specifically, rather than feeling some kind of positive emotion, that increased the number of worms they were willing to slaughter. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In subsequent studies, the team modified the experiment, though the worm-grinding element stayed the same. They found that participants who were made to feel more grateful to the experimenter specifically (by being informed that the experimenter had picked a desirable rather than boring task for them to complete), were also willing to harm more worms. However, feelings of admiration for the experimenter made no difference to the number of worms sent to their doom — so admiration for an authority figure did not seem to be playing a role in driving the participants’ obedience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A final study suggested that people who feel grateful feel a stronger desire to keep their relationships harmonious — which can explain why they are more likely to obey other people’s requests. Some participants who’d been induced to feel gratitude were also told that while social harmony is important, other things should sometimes take priority. This reduced the number of worms that they put in the grinder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, gratitude-enhanced obedience could be a good thing. A grateful and more obedient child would be more likely to obey a parent’s request to clean their bedroom, for example. But if the request — or command — is immoral (or even just questionable), then greater obedience is clearly undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have found that a desire to affiliate with others does encourage us to be more accommodating of other people’s wishes. “However, the current findings go beyond prior literature by showing gratitude facilities obedience and consequently may contribute to repugnant actions that violate moral values,” the team writes. (When questioned afterwards, almost all the participants reporting believing that the worms really were going to be ground, they note.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How might this translate into the real world? As the team suggests, it’s possible that an extremist group or gang that provides a sense of belonging or physical protection to a new recruit may gain that individual’s gratitude — which could then increase their willingness to obey a morally questionable command. Whether or not they would actually obey a command to go so far as to hurt another person as a result of this gratitude is a different matter. “However,” the researchers write, “minimally, the studies might indicate that gratitude can render one more likely to commit small, harmful acts perceived as trivial on command.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-99648-001&quot;&gt;Gratitude facilitates obedience: New evidence for the social alignment perspective.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780593136270&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Under a White Sky cover&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096216&quot; height=&quot;186&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021321_JL_reviews_cover-123x186.jpg&quot; width=&quot;123&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780593136270&quot;&gt;Under a White Sky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elizabeth Kolbert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crown, $28&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 1900, the city of Chicago completed a 45-kilometer-long canal that altered the hydrology of two-thirds of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That wasn’t the intention, of course. The plan was to reverse the flow of the Chicago River to divert waste away from the city’s source of drinking water: Lake Michigan. The engineering feat worked, but it also connected the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins, two of the world’s largest — and until then, isolated — freshwater ecosystems, allowing invasive species to pour through the opening and wreak ecological havoc.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Kolbert opens &lt;em&gt;Under a White Sky: The Nature of the Future&lt;/em&gt; with this parable of humans’ hubristic attempts to control nature. We’ve put our minds toward damming or diverting most of the planet’s rivers, replacing vast tracts of natural ecosystems with crops, and burning so much fossil fuel that 1 in 3 molecules of atmospheric carbon dioxide came from human action, she writes. We’ve warmed the atmosphere, raised sea levels, erased countless species and forged an uncertain future for humankind and the planet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our collective ingenuity got us into this mess, and Kolbert explores whether that same ingenuity can get us out. This is “a book about people trying to solve problems created by people trying to solve problems,” she writes. A fitting follow-up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sixth-extinction&quot;&gt;her Pulitzer Prize–winning &lt;em&gt;The Sixth Extinction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/22/14, p. 28&lt;/em&gt;), the book will satisfy readers keen on a skeptical survey of how innovation could save coral reefs or turn climate-warming carbon into stone.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Kolbert takes a firsthand look at many of these interventions. She begins on a boat, traveling up the Chicago canal to inspect electric barriers meant to keep invasive Asian carp from forever altering the Great Lakes. Asian carp were introduced to the Mississippi River basin in the 1960s as a biological Weedwacker to control invasive plants. But the carp have swum amok throughout the basin and are now knocking at the door of Lake Michigan. Simply closing the canal would protect the lakes, but that’s largely dismissed as being too disruptive to the city. Instead, humans innovate. “First you reverse a river,” Kolbert writes. “Then you electrify it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each chapter builds on this theme of increasingly elaborate (or desperate?) interventions intended to limit the fallout of previous problem solving. The scale of the problems widens too, which could leave a reader’s head spinning, but Kolbert keeps her globe-trotting grounded in immersive reporting and recurring nods to the tragic, and often comic, absurdity of it all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To save the endangered Devils Hole pupfish (&lt;em&gt;Cyprinodon diabolis&lt;/em&gt;), a couple-centimeters-long streak of sapphire found in a single desert pool in Nevada, researchers built a $4.5 million replica of the pool to house a backup population. The simulacrum — which mimics the smallest details of the actual pool, including a shallow shelf reconstructed from laser images of the real thing — requires round-the-clock caretaking. As Kolbert watches staff use tweezers to remove beetles that have developed a taste for young pupfish, she notes how much easier it is to ruin an ecosystem than to run one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;cavern in Nevada&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096217&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021321_JL_reviews_inline-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096217&quot;&gt;This water-filled cavern in Nevada is the only place in the world where Devils Hole pupfish live in the wild.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096217&quot;&gt;USFWS Pacific Southwest Region/Flickr (&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;CC BY 2.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Saving larger ecosystems may require more powerful tools. In Australia, we meet researchers trying to genetically engineer less toxic cane toads, an invasive species that’s poisoning untold numbers of native animals. Gene drive technology, which loads the dice of inheritance to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-drives-spread-their-wings&quot;&gt;propel certain mutations through a population&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/12/15, p. 16&lt;/em&gt;), could make all cane toads safer to eat within generations. Other scientists are considering the possibility of using gene drives to eliminate invasive rodents from islands like New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such power could prove difficult to wield, and many worry it would backfire. Mouse-eliminating gene drives might escape an island and spread across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kolbert does not explicitly argue for or against these measures, but frankly acknowledges the stakes. “What’s the alternative?” she writes. “Rejecting such technologies as unnatural isn’t going to bring nature back. The choice is not between what was and what is, but between what is and what will be, which, often enough, is nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Humankind’s most audacious idea to rein in the collateral damage of modernization is geoengineering. By stuffing the stratosphere with reflective particles, Kolbert explains, we could almost immediately start to reverse global warming. But it would also turn the sky white, scramble weather patterns and who knows what else. The fundamental resource of all life — sunlight — would be dimmed, intentionally, by us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Had we acted decades ago to curb greenhouse gas emissions or limit habitat destruction, such schemes would remain science fiction. But we’ve kicked the can down the road for too long. Gene editing species or geoengineering may be entirely crazy and disconcerting, Kolbert writes, but if they can pull us from the hole we’ve dug for ourselves, don’t we have to at least consider them? Whether such technologies can save us and the planet, or only further muck it up, Kolbert cannot say. &lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lightning-bolt-flash-birth-high-speed-video"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A new slow-motion video offers the best view yet of the split-second collision of electric currents that creates a flash of lightning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The video captures a thread of electric current, or lightning leader, zipping down from a thundercloud to meet another leader reaching up from the ground. When the two touch, it triggers a much stronger current to surge between the cloud and ground, and lightning flashes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A single strand of electricity, or streamer, at the frayed tip of each lightning leader is enough &lt;a href=&quot;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020GL091608&quot;&gt;to forge the connection between the two currents&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report online February 1 in &lt;em&gt;Geophysical Research Letters&lt;/em&gt;. Understanding this cloud-to-ground connection is important because it determines where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/two-lightning-flashes-shattered-distance-duration-records&quot;&gt;lightning strikes&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/25/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Streamers at the tips of lightning leaders were known to link these currents together. But because streamers are so faint and lightning leaders merge in mere millionths of a second, it was unclear exactly how they fused together. The link could be forged by many overlapping streamers coalescing into a single channel of electric current, or by contact between single streamers from each leader.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;images of lightning formation over time&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096210&quot; height=&quot;197&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/020421_MT_lightning_inline.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096210&quot;&gt;Lightning is fast, but high-speed cameras are faster — allowing scientists to view the play-by-play of how lightning flashes form (shown left to right, each frame 2.6 millionths of a second apart). When an electric current traveling down from a cloud meets one reaching up from the ground, a single thin strand of electricity bridges the gap (red box), triggering a flash of lightning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096210&quot;&gt;R. Jiang &lt;em&gt;et al/Geophysical Research Letters &lt;/em&gt;2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rubin Jiang, an atmospheric scientist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, and colleagues caught two lightning leaders on tape in 2017, during a lightning storm. Using a high-speed camera that snapped a picture of the lightning bolt every 2.6 microseconds, Jiang and colleagues saw a play-by-play of what happened when the fringe of streamers at the tip of each lightning leader met.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A single glowing filament of electricity appeared between the leaders right before the flash of lightning. That suggests that the hairline connection between the first two streamers to touch channeled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muons-reveal-voltages-inside-thunderstorm&quot;&gt;the torrent of electric current&lt;/a&gt; that formed the lightning flash, while the other streamers fizzled out (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/15/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Behold: the split-second collision of electric currents that creates a flash of lightning. A current reaches down from a cloud. It meets another reaching up from the ground. When a single tenuous thread of electricity bridges the gap between them, lightning flashes.&lt;/figure&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/calories-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrition labeling is an effective tool used by manufacturers and retailers to improve the public health, and its framework has been of importance to governments and policy makers. The front of pack nutrition labeling is part of United Kingdom government`s program of activities aiming to tackle diet-related diseases. There are several front of pack labeling formats available and they differ in the information they deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five hundred food products in five categories [(1) cereals and cereal products, (2) dairy products, (3) beverages, (4) packaged meats and meat products, and (5) pre-packaged fruits and vegetables] from three main United Kingdom retail websites were investigated. A simple random sampling method was used for product selection and, the types of the front of pack labels and levels of healthiness of the foods were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dominant front of pack labeling formats in the UK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12266&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12266&quot; height=&quot;218&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/blog-Word-300x218.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Daniel A. Ogundijo et. al. BMC Public Health&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traffic light rating system (TLRS) and Guideline Daily Amount (GDA) are believed to provide at-a-glance nutrition information to consumers at the point of purchase and help consumers to choose food products based on their health and nutrition needs. The nutrition information displayed on the front of pack labels allowed food products to be grouped according to their levels of healthiness. The TLRS and GDA are the most common labeling formats that are used in the UK. As seen in the figure below, a combination of TLRS/GDA and TLRS/Health logos were dominant on the assessed food labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The levels of healthiness of foods in the UK retail market&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healthiness of foods was assessed by categorizing the food products into ‘healthier’, ’moderately healthy’ and ‘least healthy’ based on fat, saturated fat, salt, and sugar contents. Red means the food is high in one of these and should be eaten less often or in smaller amounts. Amber means the food contains medium amount (neither high nor low) and may be eaten more frequently. Green indicates that the food is low in these nutrients and therefore is a healthier choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food manufacturers are now responding to the trends that are driven by the public`s demand for the wider availability of healthier foods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found out that a higher number of assessed products belonged to the “moderately healthy” and “healthier” categories than the “least healthy”. This could suggest that food manufacturers are now responding to the trends that are driven by the public`s demand for the wider availability of healthier foods. The imported foods that were found in the United Kingdom retail market also showed that healthier food choices could be made from the diverse food types around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abstract for the talk is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is an initiative to provide a ready to use Fedora based Free/Open source software platform for neuroscience.
We believe that similar to Free software, science should be free for all to use, share, modify, and study.
The use of Free software also aids reproducibility, data sharing, and collaboration in the research community.
By making the tools used in the scientific process easier to use, NeuroFedora aims to take a step to enable this ideal.
In this session, I will talk about the deliverables of the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; project and then go over the complete pipeline that we use to produce, test, and disseminate them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://briansimulator.org/&quot;&gt;Brian Simulator&lt;/a&gt; is a free, open-source simulator for spiking neural networks, written in Python.
It provides researchers with the means to express any kind of neural model in mathematical notation and takes care of translating these model descriptions into efficient executable code.
During this dev session I will first give a quick introduction to the simulator itself and its code generation mechanism.
I will then walk through Brian’s code structure, our automatic systems for tests and documentation, and demonstrate how we work on its development.
The Brian simulator welcome contributions on many levels, hopefully this dev session will give you an idea where to start.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;h2&gt;Meetings going forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluejeans, do we want to record? For &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SIG&lt;/span&gt; meetings, we agreed to use BlueJeans with recordings enabled on for members to refer to later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we need breakout rooms? We agreed that breakout rooms may be needed during tutorials/developer sessions and so can be decided on a per-session basis. These are not expected to be needed at regular &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WG&lt;/span&gt; progress meetings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;guidelines-progress&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Guidelines progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The source repository is here on GitHub: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareDevelopmentGuidelines&quot;&gt;https://github.com/&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OCNS&lt;/span&gt;/SoftwareDevelopmentGuidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, we agreed that the style of the guidelines should be to advise readers, not to force them to follow listed suggestions. Readers will choose the right practices that suit their project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first version will contain high level suggestions and will be targeted at beginners. More technical, detailed guidelines will be added later for advanced users.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, we will mention the presence of PEPs for Python and suggest ones that projects should follow. However, we will stress that not all PEPs are to be followed as rules. Rather, it is more important to adopt a set of relevant PEPs and apply them consistently in the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The guidelines will aid readers in choosing the right license for their project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The guidelines will also help readers document their projects, for their users and potential contributors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WG&lt;/span&gt; discussed the possibility of taking on more teaching focussed tasks, for example, in collaboration with the Software Carpentry and/or Code Coderefinery projects.
The &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;INCF&lt;/span&gt; training space’s study tracks can also be used for such activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hackathon(s)? Local hackathons in collaboration with the Brainhack project?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dev focussed workshops?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tutorials? Neuroscience focussed Software Carpentry sessions?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will at at minimum hold a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WG&lt;/span&gt; progress meeting at the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;INCF&lt;/span&gt; assembly.
The current plan is to host more sessions/tutorials, depending on the members’ workloads/availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Vaccine rollout in the United States has been undeniably slow. And while we wait, worrisome new coronavirus variants are emerging, heightening the urgency to control the pandemic. Some variants, including ones first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the United Kingdom, have mutations that help the coronavirus evade parts of the immune system, raising the specter that some people might face a second round of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All of this can make it feel like the pandemic has come full circle and that we are back where we started. But even in the face of potential reinfections, the world has a tool at its disposal that didn’t exist a year ago: effective vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shots from Pfizer and Moderna have been authorized in the United States since December 2020. Vaccines developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-novavax-vaccine-results-south-africa-variant&quot;&gt;Novavax&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-johnson-and-johnson-results-variants&quot;&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson&lt;/a&gt; recently announced promising results (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/28/21&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;SN: 1/29/21&lt;/em&gt;). On February 4, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson became the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-submission-of-application-to-the-u-s-fda-for-emergency-use-authorization-of-its-investigational-single-shot-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate&quot;&gt;third company to apply for emergency use authorization&lt;/a&gt; in the United States for its COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;





&lt;p&gt;And preliminary data from AstraZeneca suggest that a &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3777268&quot;&gt;single dose of its vaccine may lower the number of people who test positive&lt;/a&gt; for the coronavirus virus by 67 percent, possibly reducing the spread of the virus in the community, researchers reported February 1 in &lt;em&gt;Preprints with the Lancet&lt;/em&gt;. Curbing transmission is the holy grail of vaccine effectiveness: That would give the coronavirus fewer chances to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccines-coronavirus-variants-challenges&quot;&gt;acquire potentially dangerous mutations&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/27/21&lt;/em&gt;). That, in turn, could finally bring the end of the pandemic into view.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, researchers are grappling with understanding the threat the known mutations pose. Even if someone has antibodies to the coronavirus — through a natural infection or a vaccine — some mutations can stymie the antibodies’ ability to latch onto the virus and prevent it from infecting cells. Though antibodies make up only one part of the immune system’s arsenal to eliminate viruses from the body, the variants’ ability to dodge the immune proteins could put people who have already recovered from a bout of COVID-19 at risk of getting infected again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-first-case-reinfection-man-hong-kong&quot;&gt;first confirmed reinfection&lt;/a&gt; with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was reported in August (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/24/20&lt;/em&gt;). There have been some documented cases of reinfection with new variants as well — including in &lt;a href=&quot;https://virological.org/t/sars-cov-2-reinfection-by-the-new-variant-of-concern-voc-p-1-in-amazonas-brazil/596&quot;&gt;Manaus, Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and in an Israeli &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/israeli-coronavirus-survivor-gets-reinfected-with-south-african-variant-657381&quot;&gt;traveler to South Africa&lt;/a&gt; — although some details remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reinfections are difficult to prove. Doctors need genetic evidence to show that a distinct coronavirus strain caused each instance of infection. What’s more, some people might never develop symptoms and remain unaware of a second infection. As a result, researchers still don’t know how often people are reinfected with the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To explore what the emergence of new variants might mean for reinfections, vaccines and the pandemic, &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt; spoke to Aubree Gordon, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN:&lt;/em&gt; What have we learned about reinfection since August?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon:&lt;/strong&gt; We know [reinfections] happen. We don’t know much beyond that. There are a number of studies out there, and there have been case reports of reinfections, but at this point we still don’t know how common they are. What you would expect to see with reinfections is that as people get further out from having their first infection, you would see more reinfections. But of course, at this point, we’re a little bit over a year into the pandemic so there hasn’t been a lot of time for many people to get reinfected yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN&lt;/em&gt;: Why hasn’t there been enough time? Why do reinfections happen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon: &lt;/strong&gt;Reinfections occur for a variety of different reasons. But, generally, it’s because somebody no longer has sufficient immunity to the virus to prevent them from getting infected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got the same virus [without mutations], people may get reinfected because they did not mount a really strong response to the virus the first time they were infected. Or maybe they did mount a strong response but then that response wanes or decreases over time, to the level where it isn’t protective against getting infected again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another way that reinfections occur is that the virus may change. If there are changes in the virus that occur so that your antibodies no longer recognize the virus or some areas of the virus, at least, then reinfections may occur. In particular for SARS-CoV-2, those [changes] could be to its spike [the protein the virus uses to break into a cell].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same thing happens with flu on a pretty regular basis. The virus changes. Because the virus changes, our bodies don’t recognize it, and then we can get reinfected with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN: &lt;/em&gt;What do we know about the role the new variants will play in reinfection? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon: &lt;/strong&gt;I definitely think the reports of reinfections are concerning. But I think we need to figure out how common these reinfections are versus people who hadn’t previously had [COVID-19] and look at what the risk is.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Are [reinfected] people not protected [from the new variants] at all? I think that’s probably not the case. My guess is that a lot of people who have previously had SARS-CoV-2 are probably still protected in part, or not as protected. They may be more likely [to get infected again with the new variant] than they would with the original virus. But if you compare them to people who have never had COVID-19 before or don’t have antibodies from the vaccine, you would still see a significant amount of protection. But we still don’t have that data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also don’t know how severe those reinfections are. Researchers tend to catch the severest cases — the tip of the iceberg — and that doesn’t necessarily give you a full picture of what’s going on. We’ve certainly seen a number of individual case reports with severe reinfections, but most severe cases are going to have the best access to testing [which can overrepresent how often that happens].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN:&lt;/em&gt; If vaccines slow transmission, how does that help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon:&lt;/strong&gt; The availability of additional vaccines, such as the AstraZeneca vaccine, will speed up the vaccination process. And if the vaccines do reduce transmission, that is also very good news. [Fewer cases mean fewer opportunities for the virus to mutate.]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even before the emergence of the variants, it was critical that we vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible and the variants have only amplified that. High levels of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 combined with a large proportion of people with preexisting immunity to the original virus could lead to new variants. It also gives an advantage to existing variants that have changed enough that preexisting immunity is no longer as protective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN: &lt;/em&gt;What does all of this mean for herd immunity and vaccines?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s going to be very difficult to achieve herd immunity if you have a very significant rate of reinfection in people without immunity to new variants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard a number of people in my personal life recently express thoughts like, “Oh my gosh, is this pandemic ever going to end? Are we just going to live like this forever?” And that’s unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What we’ll probably find is that [reinfections] are going to continue to occur as the variants become more prevalent. Reinfections will probably occur more frequently, particularly as people get further out from their original infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But I think our top concerns are severe cases and deaths. We might continue to see transmission even if everybody has immunity to the original virus. But the thing that’s important is to ask what do [the symptoms] of cases [of reinfection] look like. I think everybody — including myself — is hopeful that we’re going to see a drastic reduction in severity of cases when you compare reinfections to a first infection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Certainly, some lab data suggest that perhaps the vaccines are not going to work as well against the variants. But for the Novavax vaccine, even though it was less effective for preventing symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in South Africa, where variant B.1.351 is very prevalent, it was still 100 percent effective against severe disease. I think that that’s something important that people need to pay attention to.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reason we’ve all changed our lives the way we have and have all the measures [like mask wearing and physical distancing] is because COVID-19 is causing hospitalizations and deaths. It’s causing severe disease, it’s causing severe after-effects, and [preventing those] is what we really care about. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccine companies are already starting to look into potentially making a booster or a second vaccine. We might end up with a bivalent vaccine, for example, that has both the original strain and one of the [viral] variants that’s better at evading the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN&lt;/em&gt;: So when will the pandemic end?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s going to be a little bit longer than it would have been without those variants arising. But pandemics always end eventually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can look back at flu pandemics — you usually have one or two years of circulation before enough immunity builds up to the virus. People may continue to get infected with the virus, but the infections are not as severe. And you don’t have as many people getting infected in any given year because of pre-existing immunity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think the [pandemic] timeline with the introduction of variants may be a little bit longer. But eventually, I think we’re going to arrive at a place where SARS-CoV-2 is endemic, [a commonly circulating] human coronavirus. Depending on the severity of reinfections and the length of immunity that’s generated by vaccines, we may or may not need additional booster vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 going forward.    &lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead of putting on a brave face in front of your kids, you might want to consider putting on a “brave voice”.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s according to research from Paddy Ross and team, who find that children tend to focus on the emotion in people’s voices more than the emotion in their body language. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/why-your-kids-know-when-youre-trying-to-put-on-a-brave-face-154152&quot;&gt;Ross describes the work&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41319&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;has published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/heres-what-learning-juggle-does-your-brain/&quot;&gt;fascinating extract from Tom Vanderbilt’s book&lt;/a&gt; “Beginners: The Joy and Transformative Power of Lifelong Learning”.&lt;/strong&gt; In the piece, Vanderbilt describes his experience of learning to juggle — and discusses what this process reveals about the way humans learn new skills.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The coronavirus pandemic has affected the entire population in one way or another: even those of us fortunate enough not to have caught the virus have still had our lives turned upside-down.  &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210203-after-the-covid-19-pandemic-how-will-we-heal&quot;&gt;Ed Prideaux explores&lt;/a&gt; how we might deal with the lingering effects of this “mass trauma” once the pandemic over.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meanwhile, over at &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/beat-the-burnout-how-to-fight-pandemic-fatigue-with-science/&quot;&gt;Amy Fleming examines&lt;/a&gt; strategies for dealing with “COVID burnout”: the fatigue and feelings of stagnation that many of us are experiencing. &lt;/strong&gt;Social support, maintaining a sense of a control, and getting regular exercise are all important, Fleming writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earlier this week &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/03/supposed-benefits-of-psychedelic-microdosing-to-mental-health-may-actually-reflect-strong-placebo-response/&quot;&gt;we wrote about&lt;/a&gt; the lack of evidence behind the idea that microdosing psychedelic drugs can have a positive impact on mental health. But when it comes to larger doses, there is a fair amount of preliminary evidence that these substances could be useful.&lt;/strong&gt; At &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/psychedelics-as-antidepressants/&quot;&gt;researcher Austin Lim takes a look at the current state of the field&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump is no longer in office — but his amplification of conspiracy theories has had long-lasting political and social effects.&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers who specialise in the spread of misinformation are now left trying to make sense of it all, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00257-y&quot;&gt;reports Jeff Tollefson&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, researchers have mapped out how electrical brain stimulation can give rise to various emotions&lt;/strong&gt;. The team stimulated several different brain areas in a woman who was receiving deep brain stimulation for depression. Some of those sites produced a positive or pleasant response, but others produced feelings of “doom and gloom”, apathy, and even sickness, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/brain-stimulations-complex-emotional-effects&quot;&gt;reports Neuroskeptic&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session 1: Tissue quality and processing for human census&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, February 9, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will be chaired by Drs. Ed Lein and Li-Huei Tsai. It will explore questions on current methods of tissue preparation and stabilization, optimal processing and annotation methods for prospective collection, and considerations of best practices for tissue collection, stabilization, dissection, distribution, and assay protocols. Confirmed speakers include Drs. Evan Macosko, Genevieve Konopka, Dirk Keene, Nadejda Tsankova, and Noah Snyder-Mackler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session 2: Open consent and tissue pipeline for prospective collection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, February 10, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will be chaired by Drs. Dirk Keene and Li-Huei Tsai. It will explore questions on ensuring biological diversity and a representative sample in the census, how best to achieve consent for open sharing of census data, and considerations of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Confirmed speakers include Drs. Thomas Hyde, Steven McCarroll, Deborah Mash, Tish Hevel, Harry Haroutunian, Kristin Ardlie, and Rebecca Folkerth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session 3: Break-out sessions to generate ideas for NIH consideration&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, February 11, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, attendees will breakout into small groups to identify key takeaways based on the questions posed in Sessions 1 and 2. Groups will re-convene as a collective body to provide ideas and an action plan for the NIH BRAIN Initiative to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Registration for these workshops is still open! &lt;/strong&gt;Please register &lt;a href=&quot;https://roseliassociates.zoomgov.com/meeting/register/vJItfuCprT4vHF2VbXSpS9_nIymGAZA_0qI&quot;&gt;here&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;external link&quot; class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540&quot; style=&quot;height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;&quot; title=&quot;This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/Animal-Shelter-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many of us love animals and think of our pets as part of the family? Well, what if I told you that among the 6-8 million animals that enter the rescue shelters every year, nearly 3-4 million (i.e., 50% of the incoming animals) are euthanized. Even more heartbreaking is that 10% – 25% of them are put to death specifically because of shelter overcrowding each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of overpopulation of domestic animals continues to rise, leaving shelters faced with the challenge of how to increase adoption rates. Though animal shelters provide incentives such as reduced adoption fees and sterilizing animals before adoption, only a quarter of total animals living in the shelter are adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 6-8 million animals that enter rescue shelters every year, nearly 3-4 million are euthanized&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These staggering statistics led us to investigate the length of stay of animals at shelters and the factors influencing the rate of animal adoption. The overarching goal of this study was to use these factors to predict and then minimize how long an animal will stay in a shelter, thereby decreasing the number of animals euthanized due to overcrowding. Several steps must be conducted to accomplish this goal, such as a literature search for the factors, collection of data from databases and animal shelters, and utilizing machine learning algorithms on this data to make predictions on length of stay in the shelters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-12273 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;209&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/animal-rescue-300x209.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer the question of what factors influence the length of stay, a thorough literature review was conducted. Several factors were found to influence the length of stay including color, gender, breed, animal type, and age. To make the predictions about the length of stay using these factors, we evaluated using machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is just the ability to program computers to learn and improve by itself using training experience. The developed system needs to analyze big data, quickly deliver accurate and repeatable results, and adapt to new data. A system can be trained to make accurate predictions by learning from examples of desired input-output data. In other words, we wanted to utilize a labeled data set with the output (length of stay) already known, so that the computer could learn from it. The next step was to obtain this data from databases and animal shelters across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12274 size-medium aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/Machine-learning-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data that was collected from the databases and animal shelters included information such as animal type, intake and outcome date, gender, color, breed, and intake and outcome status (behavior of animal entering the shelter and behavior of animal at outcome type). These data sets included information from mostly southern and southwestern states. For the length of stay, the categories included “low”, “medium”, “high”, and “very high” (euthanized).  Once the data was collected and cleaned, it was time to input it into the machine learning algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many different types of algorithms that can be used on a data set to make predictions. The hard part is determining which algorithm will perform the best on the given data set, as the performance of the models depends on the application. Simple classification algorithms such as logistic regression, artificial neural network, gradient boosting, and random forest were used in this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examining the results, the most proficient predictive model was developed by the gradient boosting algorithm for this dataset, followed by the random forest algorithm. The logistic regression algorithm appeared to have the worst performance metrics for all categories of length of stay. What was interesting was that the gradient boosting and random forest algorithms performed well when predicting the very high length of stay or when the outcome was euthanization at around 70-80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12270&quot; style=&quot;width: 522px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12270 size-full&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/Blog_Shelters.png&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Age vs. Days in Shelter for Cats and Dogs&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the results from the exploratory data above, it was observed that the number of days a dog stays in the shelter decreases as the age increases. This was not expected, as it is predicted that the number of days in a shelter would be lower for younger dogs and puppies. This observation could be due to having more data points for younger dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that age, size, and color have a significant impact or influence on the length of stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting result from the study was the top features or factors from each machine learning algorithm. Results showed that age (senior, super senior, and puppy), size (large and small), and color (multicolor) have a significant impact or influence on the length of stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For future studies, a prescriptive analytics approach will be utilized. Not only is our goal to increase adoption rates of pets in animal shelters, but to also determine the optimal animal shelter location where the animal will have the least amount stay in a shelter and most likely be adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ticks-animals-skinks-lyme-disease-united-states-south"/>

		<updated>2021-02-05T13:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The paucity of Lyme disease cases in the southern United States may be partly due to what black-legged ticks in southern locales bite.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although black-legged ticks (&lt;em&gt;Ixodes scapularis)&lt;/em&gt; claim much of the eastern half of the country as their home, the Lyme disease they spread is largely concentrated in the Northeast and increasingly in the upper Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s well known that ticks in the Northeast commonly latch on to white-footed mice. This relationship turns out to be a boon for Lyme disease. When infected with the bacteria &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt;, which causes Lyme disease, these mice very efficiently spread it to the ticks, which can then pass it on to people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001066&quot;&gt;southern-residing ticks are different&lt;/a&gt;. They are more likely to bite lizards called skinks, which are poor transmitters of the bacteria, researchers report January 28 in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This study “shows that there’s this really interesting switch” north to south in the predominant tick host, says disease ecologist Shannon LaDeau of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y., who was not part of the research team. “It looks like that is reducing the transmission” in the South of the bacteria that causes Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An estimated 476,000 people are &lt;a href=&quot;https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/2/20-2731_article&quot;&gt;diagnosed with Lyme disease&lt;/a&gt; each year in the United States, according to insurance data from 2010 to 2018. In about 70 to 80 percent of cases, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/signs_symptoms/rashes.html&quot;&gt;a rash in the area of the tick bite&lt;/a&gt; is an early sign of the disease; other symptoms include fever, fatigue and achiness. Most people recover with early antibiotic treatment. If the diagnosis is missed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ticks-lyme-disease-testing-new-approaches&quot;&gt;the infection can spread&lt;/a&gt; in the body and cause arthritis and nerve pain (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/22/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scanning for and removing ticks after a hike is one part of Lyme disease control. Understanding the ticks’ behavior and their relationship to the environment can inform other prevention methods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Black-legged ticks need blood meals to progress through several developmental stages. The larvae that emerge from eggs are the first to seek out a host for blood; this is the point when they can first become infected with Lyme bacteria. The next blood meal is at the nymph stage. Nymphs infected as larvae can spread the bacteria to other hosts, including people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s been a long debate about the difference in Lyme disease cases between the North and the South, says research ecologist Howard Ginsberg at the Patuxent Coastal Field Station at the University of Rhode Island in Kingston. The ticks are in the South, so “why isn’t there much Lyme disease?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One possible reason is that nymphal ticks in the North seek hosts on top of or above leaf litter, which puts them in the path of passing hikers. But nymphal ticks in the South are &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30709659/&quot;&gt;more likely to stay under leaf litter&lt;/a&gt;, reducing the chance of such encounters, researchers reported in &lt;em&gt;Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases&lt;/em&gt; in 2019. It may be that the ticks remain below the leaf litter in the hotter South to avoid drying out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This host-seeking behavior and the results of the new study help to explain the North-South difference, Ginsberg says. In 2011 and 2012, he and his colleagues captured host animals in live traps and collected and tested ticks at eight sites in the eastern half of the United States. “We tried to catch everything that crawled on the ground that the tick might attach to,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the North, the most common hosts were mice, while in the South, the ticks selectively attached to skinks, Ginsberg says. At the Massachusetts site, for example, 75 percent of the larvae and 93 percent of the nymphs were removed from mice, which accounted for 79 percent of the captured host animals. The team caught no skinks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But at the Florida site, although around 40 percent of the animals captured were mice, they had only 3 percent of the larvae and less than 1 percent of the nymphs. Meanwhile, skinks — which made up 28 percent of the host animals captured — had 92 percent of the larvae and 98 percent of the nymphs. The team also found that the ticks at the northern sites were much more likely to be infected with Lyme bacteria than ticks from southern sites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding the ecological context of Lyme disease can help identify targets to try to reduce human risk, LaDeau says. For example, the possibility of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ticks-here-stay-scientists-finding-ways-outsmart-bloodsuckers&quot;&gt;vaccinating mice&lt;/a&gt; against Lyme bacteria (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/9/17&lt;/em&gt;) may be more useful in the North.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The differences seen north to south also influence predictions of how climate change could impact Lyme disease. Black-legged ticks have moved farther north, bringing Lyme disease to Canada, in part due to warming. Perhaps the behaviors and biting patterns in the South will eventually expand to Maryland, Delaware and Virginia, reducing Lyme disease cases there, says Ginsberg. It will take more research to learn how climate change will affect skink populations and how warming might change tick behavior, he says.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/exoplanet-families-planetary-systems-density-resonance"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3096160</id>
		<updated>2021-02-05T11:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Two tightly packed families of exoplanets are pushing the boundaries of what a planetary system can look like. New studies of the makeup of worlds orbiting two different stars show a wide range of planetary possibilities, all of them different from our solar system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we study multiplanet systems, there’s simply more information kept in these systems” than any single planet by itself, says geophysicist Caroline Dorn of the University of Zurich. Studying the planets together “tells us about the diversity within a system that we can’t get from looking at individual planets.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dorn and colleagues studied an old favorite planetary system called TRAPPIST-1, which hosts seven Earth-sized planets orbiting a small dim star about 40 light-years away. Another team studied a recently identified system called TOI-178, which has at least six planets — three already known and three newly found — circling a bright, hot star roughly 200 light-years away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both systems offer planetary scientists an advantage over the more than 3,000 other exoplanet families spotted to date: All seven planets in TRAPPIST-1 and all six in TOI-178 have well-known masses and radii. That means planetary scientists can figure out their densities, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recipes-solar-system-exoplanets-formation-rewrite&quot;&gt;clue to the planets’ composition&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/11/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The two systems also offer another advantage: The planets are packed in so close to their stars that most are engaged in a delicate orbital dance called a resonance chain. Every time an outer planet completes an orbit around its star, some of its closer-in sibling planets complete multiple orbits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Resonance chains are fragile arrangements, and knocking a planet even slightly out of its orbit can destroy them. That means the TRAPPIST-1 and TOI-178 systems must have formed slowly and gently, says astronomer Adrien Leleu of the University of Geneva.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;TOI-178’s planets are engaged in a delicate orbital dance called a resonance chain that suggests the system formed gently. This video illustrates this rhythmic dance: as an outer planet completes one full orbit, the inner planets complete multiple orbits. Each full and half orbit is assigned a musical note. When planets align, the notes harmonize.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We don’t think there could have been giant impacts, or strong interactions where one planet ejected another planet,” Leleu says. That gentle evolution gives astronomers a unique opportunity to use TRAPPIST-1 and TOI-178 as testbeds for planetary theory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a pair of papers, two teams describe these systems in unprecedented detail. Both buck the trend astronomers expected from theories of how planetary systems form.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the TOI-178 system, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aanda.org/component/article?access=doi&amp;amp;doi=10.1051/0004-6361/202039767&quot;&gt;the planets’ densities are all jumbled up&lt;/a&gt;, Leleu and colleagues report January 25 in &lt;em&gt;Astronomy &amp;amp; Astrophysics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the most vanilla scenario, we expect that planets farther from the star…would have larger components of hydrogen and helium gas than the planets closer in,” says astrophysicist Leslie Rogers of the University of Chicago, who was not involved in either study. The closer to the star, the denser a planet should be. That’s because farther-out planets probably formed where it’s cold, and there was more low-density material like frozen water, rather than rock, to begin with. Plus, starlight can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newfound-exoplanet-may-be-exposed-core-gas-giant&quot;&gt;strip atmospheres from close-in planets&lt;/a&gt; more easily than far-out ones, leaving the inner planets with thinner atmospheres — or no atmospheres at all (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/1/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TOI-178 flouts that trend entirely. The innermost planets seem to be rocky, with densities similar to Earth’s. The third one is “very fluffy,” Leleu says, with a density like Jupiter’s, but in a much smaller planet. The next planet out has a density like Neptune’s, about one-third Earth’s density. Then, there’s one with about 60 percent Earth’s density, still fluffy enough to float if you could put it in a tub of water, and the final planet is Jupiter-like.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The orbits seem to point out that there was no strong evolution from [the system’s] formation,” Leleu says. “But the compositions are not what we would have expected from a gentle formation in the disk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TRAPPIST-1’s planet septet, on the other hand, has an eerie self-similarity. Each world is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seven-earth-sized-planets-orbit-nearby-supercool-star&quot;&gt;roughly the same size as Earth&lt;/a&gt;, between 0.76 and 1.13 times Earth’s radius, astrophysicist Eric Agol of the University of Washington in Seattle and colleagues reported in 2017 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/22/17&lt;/em&gt;). Plus, at least three of them appear to be in the star’s habitable zone, the region where temperatures might be right for liquid water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, Agol, Dorn and colleagues have made the most precise measurements of the TRAPPIST-1 masses yet. All seven worlds &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/abd022&quot;&gt;are almost identical to each other but slightly less dense than Earth&lt;/a&gt;, the team reports in the February &lt;em&gt;Planetary Science Journal&lt;/em&gt;. That means the planets could be rocky yet have a lower proportion of heavy elements such as iron compared with Earth. Or it could mean they have more oxygen bound to the iron in their rocks, “basically rusting it,” Agol says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Three planets with different compositions&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096164&quot; height=&quot;308&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/012921_lg_multiplanet_inline_mobile_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096164&quot;&gt;TRAPPIST-1’s seven planets seem to have similar compositions to each other, but different from Earth. They could have an Earthlike makeup but with a smaller iron-rich core (center), or have no core at all (left). They could also have deep oceans (right), but the inner three planets are probably too hot for that much water to last.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096164&quot;&gt;JPL-Caltech/NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oxidized iron wouldn’t form a planetary core, which could be bad news for life, Rogers says. No core might mean no magnetic field to protect the planets from the star’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/proxima-centauri-flare-may-have-fried-earths-nearest-exoplanet&quot;&gt;damaging flares&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/5/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, it’s not clear how to form coreless planets. “There are propositions for how to form such planets, but we don’t actually have one candidate in the solar system where we see this,” Dorn says. The analogs in the solar system are all asteroid-sized bodies much less massive than Earth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Astronomers may soon get a better handle on the compositions of TRAPPIST-1’s planets. The James Webb Space Telescope, set to launch in October, will probe the planets’ atmospheres (if they have any) for signs of chemical elements that would reveal in more detail what they’re made of.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The TRAPPIST-1 planets’ similarities to each other are not as surprising as the differences among TOI-178’s planets, Rogers says. But they’re still unexpected. If all the planets have identical compositions, then any formation model needs to explain that, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While these systems challenge astronomers’ views of what sorts of planets are possible, Dorn says, it will take discovering more multiplanet systems to tell how weird they truly are.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lead-children-missed-blood-tests-us-2020-covid-19"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3096182</id>
		<updated>2021-02-04T23:59:20+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Close to a half million U.S. children didn’t get tested for lead in the first half of 2020. Nearly 10,000 of those children may have elevated levels of the toxic metal in their blood, researchers estimate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study is another troubling indicator of the preventive medical care that children as well as adults in the United States haven’t received since the start of the pandemic. Children haven’t been coming in for pediatric appointments, missing lead testing as well as routine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919e2.htm?s_cid=mm6919e2_w&quot;&gt;vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;. Of adults who needed care from March — when widespread shutdowns to curb the spread of COVID-19 began — to mid-July of 2020, 58 percent reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2775366&quot;&gt;forgoing scheduled preventive visits&lt;/a&gt;. Screening &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6773.13596&quot;&gt;mammogram&lt;/a&gt; visits fell after March 2020 compared with previous years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The health risks to children with elevated lead levels are severe and include &lt;a href=&quot;https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/138/1/e20161493&quot;&gt;damage to the brain, developmental delays and learning and behavioral problems&lt;/a&gt; such as inattention, hyperactivity and aggression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers poured over data from 34 state and local health departments, assessing blood level testing among children under age 6. From January through May 2020, 480,172 fewer children were tested, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7005a2.htm?s_cid=mm7005a2_e&amp;amp;ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM48285&amp;amp;ACSTrackingLabel=This%20Week%20in%20MMWR%20-%20Vol.%2070%2C%20February%205%2C%202021&amp;amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM48285&quot;&gt;34 percent drop&lt;/a&gt;, compared with that time period in 2019, researchers report February 5 in &lt;em&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/em&gt;. The number of children tested dropped sharply starting in March, the data show. Overall, those missed tests left an estimated 9,603 children with elevated blood lead levels unidentified.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Those children “continue to be exposed,” says Maitreyi Mazumdar, a pediatric neurologist at Boston Children’s Hospital who was not involved in the study. There is no safe level of lead. A benchmark level of 5 micrograms per deciliter of blood or greater is a signal to take action. Lead screenings are the starting point to finding children at high risk and removing the source of their lead exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although blood lead levels have fallen dramatically since the United States began phasing out leaded gasoline in 1973 and banned lead in house paint in 1978, the toxic metal persists in the environment. Children are exposed to lead by paint chips found in homes built prior to 1978, contaminated soil and old lead pipes and fixtures. The number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/leads-damage-can-last-lifetime-or-longer&quot;&gt;children with elevated blood lead levels doubled in Flint&lt;/a&gt; after a switch in the Michigan city’s water source caused lead to leach from city pipes, which contaminated residents’ tap water (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/15/16&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Children living in poverty and children of color are more likely to be exposed to lead, Mazumdar says. Even low-level exposures can have long-lasting effects across children’s lives, impacting their “ability to perform well in school and have employment and all of these others things that are important in the long run.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Testing children for lead as well as staying up to date with vaccines is still necessary, says Mazumdar; mask wearing, handwashing and other prevention measures can lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure during pediatric health visits. Lead testing is not very time-consuming, she says. “It still needs to be done.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Damien Drix will talk about a paper &quot;Rapid online learning and robust recall in a neuromorphic olfactory circuit&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a neural algorithm for the rapid online learning and identification
of odourant samples under noise, based on the architecture of the mammalian
olfactory bulb and implemented on the Intel Loihi neuromorphic system. As with
biological olfaction, the spike timing-based algorithm utilizes distributed,
event-driven computations and rapid (one shot) online learning. Spike
timing-dependent plasticity rules operate iteratively over sequential
gamma-frequency packets to construct odour representations from the activity of
chemosensor arrays mounted in a wind tunnel. Learned odourants then are
reliably identified despite strong destructive interference. Noise resistance
is further enhanced by neuromodulation and contextual priming. Lifelong
learning capabilities are enabled by adult neurogenesis. The algorithm is
applicable to any signal identification problem in which high-dimensional
signals are embedded in unknown backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-tiny-chameleon-species-may-be-world-smallest-reptile"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3096173</id>
		<updated>2021-02-04T18:18:19+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Hidden beneath the leaf litter of a northern Malagasy forest lives a chameleon so slight that it could tumble off the tip of your finger. Measuring just under 30 millimeters from snout to tail, the newly described species, &lt;em&gt;Brookesia nana, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80955-1&quot;&gt;may be the smallest reptile on Earth&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report January 28 in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just two adult specimens, a male and female, are known. The female measures 28.9 millimeters, considerably larger than the 21.6-millimeter-long male. The size difference may have driven the male’s genitalia to be quite large — nearly 20 percent of its body length — to be a better fit to his mate, herpetologist Frank Glaw of the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology in Munich and colleagues suggest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dubbed &lt;em&gt;B. nana&lt;/em&gt; for its nano size, the species belongs to a genus of at least 13 other small chameleons spread out across the mountainous forests of northern Madagascar. Why &lt;em&gt;B. nana&lt;/em&gt; and its cousins shrank to such minuscule proportions remains a mystery, though smallness does have its benefits: There’s some evidence that small chameleons &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep18625&quot;&gt;are especially good shots&lt;/a&gt; with their ballistic tongues. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In daylight, &lt;em&gt;Brookesia&lt;/em&gt; chameleons scour the forest floor, snatching up mites and other small invertebrates, Glaw’s team suspects. At night, the lizards retreat upward, gripping blades of grass or other plants for safety. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deforestation and habitat degradation threaten &lt;em&gt;B. nana&lt;/em&gt;’s future, the researchers say, though the region where the compact chameleons were found was recently designated a protected area by the Malagasy government. The species may soon be listed as critically endangered, the gravest rating made by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;We (INCF) have, as of this morning, officially applied to Google as a mentoring organization in 2021. This is our 11th time. We have a &lt;a data-id=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/14wnNV-cIqTIF3eE9QJXtkwyW7lQomUiCLVVPFafX6Js/edit?usp=sharing&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/14wnNV-cIqTIF3eE9QJXtkwyW7lQomUiCLVVPFafX6Js/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Project Ideas list&lt;/a&gt; of 55 projects from 27 mentor teams, a new record!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step is interacting with prospective students, and waiting for Google’s announcement of this year’s accepted mentor organizations (March 9). Since a few years back, we post all project ideas on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurostars.org/c/gsoc/5&quot;&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier  for students and mentors to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Thick yarn makes for a quick knit. I am already finished with the Gunhild cardigan, a month before the agreed deadline. Slight stumbling block on the way; I ran out of main colour yarn after doing some modifications. And it wasn’t to be had anywhere in Europe, and out of stock at the supplier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But I had bought some extra contrast color yarn, so I ended up doing half sleeves in the contrast color, and not just the edging. With extra long sleeves, which I like. And I sewed in a button so it would be wearable without a shawl pin for closure.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that people learn better when taught in a way that matches their specific “learning style” — auditory, kinesthetic, visual or some combination of the three — is widely considered a myth. Research has variously suggested that learners &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/03/another-nail-in-the-coffin-for-learning-styles-students-did-not-benefit-from-studying-according-to-their-supposed-learning-style/&quot;&gt;don’t actually benefit&lt;/a&gt; from their preferred style, that teachers and pupils have &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/12/an-additional-reason-to-abandon-learning-styles-teachers-and-pupils-do-not-agree-on-the-pupils-preferred-learning-style/&quot;&gt;different ideas&lt;/a&gt; about what learning styles actually work for them, and that we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/05/it-feels-as-though-we-learn-better-via-our-preferred-learning-style-but-we-dont/&quot;&gt;very little insight&lt;/a&gt; into how much we’re actually learning from various methods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite this evidence, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/07/20/oh-dear-even-people-with-neuroscience-training-believe-an-awful-lot-of-brain-myths/&quot;&gt;large proportion of people&lt;/a&gt; — including the general public, educators and even those with a background in neuroscience — still believe in the myth. And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.602451/full&quot;&gt;new review&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Education&lt;/em&gt;, finds no signs of that changing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41302&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team looked at articles that focused on belief in learning styles published between 2009 and April 2020. Articles with participant groups that were not made up of educators or trainee educators were excluded from analysis, as were surveys that focused not on whether learning styles actually existed but on other opinions — whether they explain differences in achievement, for example. Data from over 15,000 educators were included in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, 89.1% of participants believed that people learn better when instruction is matched to their learning styles. A total of 95.4% of trainee educators believed in learning styles — slightly higher than the 87.8% of qualified educators who showed similar beliefs. And despite more widespread debunking of the myth, both in academic publishing and the mainstream media, there was no significant decrease in belief in studies conducted more recently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This had a real impact on how teachers worked: in the seven studies that measured use or planned use of learning style-matched teaching, 79.7% of educators said they used or intended to use matched teaching methods. Interventions designed to disavow educators of their belief in learning styles did seem to make some difference, however — in the four studies that utilised training for these purposes, belief decreased significantly, from 78.4% to 37.1%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The myth of learning styles, it seems, is as pervasive as ever. But &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; educators continue to believe in them is less clear. It may be that the belief is heavily promoted during teacher training; it could be that teachers are working with their students as their teachers worked with them; or it could be that attempts to debunk the myth have simply not been high profile enough, failing to cut through to educators.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But researchers could also do with improving research into the prevalence of learning style myths, the team suggests. Many studies included in the analysis had no key indicators of the quality of survey responses, raising questions about the generalisability of findings. “None of the studies use a defined, representative sample, and very few include sufficient information to allow the calculation of a response rate,” the team writes. The questionnaires used in the studies could also be clearer about exactly what it means to “match” instruction to learning styles, the authors add.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future research could also look at the &lt;em&gt;consequences&lt;/em&gt; of learning style-matched teaching — does it actually matter if the myth is perpetuated, and does it have a serious impact on how people learn? Studying how training can educate teachers on the learning style myth could also help us understand how it spreads and why it sticks — and might help students get the most out of education at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.602451/full&quot;&gt;How Common Is Belief in the Learning Styles Neuromyth, and Does It Matter? A Pragmatic Systematic Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;In the late 1800s, Santiago Ramón y Cajal, a Spanish brain scientist, spent long hours in his attic drawing elaborate cells. His careful, solitary work helped reveal individual cells of the brain that together create wider networks. For those insights, Cajal received a Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine in 1906.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, a group of embroiderers has traced those iconic cell images with thread, paying tribute to the pioneering drawings that helped us see the brain clearly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Cajal Embroidery Project was launched in March of 2020 by scientists at the University of Edinburgh. Over a hundred volunteers — scientists, artists and embroiderers — sewed panels &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(20)30348-3/fulltext&quot;&gt;that will ultimately be stitched into a tapestry&lt;/a&gt;, a project described in the December &lt;em&gt;Lancet Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Catherine Abbott, a neuroscientist at the University of Edinburgh, had the idea while talking with her colleague Jane Haley, who was planning an exhibit of Cajal’s drawings. These meticulous drawings re-created nerve cells, or neurons, and other types of brain cells, including support cells called astrocytes. “I said, off the cuff, ‘Wouldn’t it be lovely to embroider some of them?’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The project had just begun when the COVID-19 pandemic upended the world. But stitching at home amid the shutdowns was a soothing activity, says Katie Askew, a neuroimmunologist at the University of Edinburgh. “Having something that can occupy your hands so you’re not scrolling through your phone looking at the news is great,” she says. Askew chose to re-create a type of neuron known as a Purkinje cell from a human cerebellum, a structure at the back and bottom of the brain that helps coordinate movement. Purkinje cells collect signals with lush thickets of tendrils, before sending along their own quieting signals. Cajal’s particular specimen nearly filled Askew’s fabric panel. “They are amazing cells,” she says. Spending months staring at a single cell has led her to spot similar branches in trees, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;9 embroideries of Cajal drawings&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3095837&quot; height=&quot;680&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/012621_ls_brain-embroidery_inline_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3095837&quot;&gt;To honor the insights of Santiago Ramón y Cajal, embroiderers re-created nine of his iconic drawings, which spanned an array of cell types in the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3095837&quot;&gt;Cajal Embroidery Project; top row (left to right): Liz Ribchester, Katie Askew, Janet Philp; middle row: Carol Coleman, Jane Haley, Emma Perkins; bottom row: Niki Stypidou, Melanie Stefan, Alison Todd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cajal’s artistic eye is obvious in his drawings, says Annie Campbell, one of the volunteers who contributed a square. “His images live in this liminal space between science and fine art,” says Campbell, who is herself an artist at Auburn University in Alabama. “He was making aesthetic decisions about what to leave out so that somebody could look at that and say, ‘Oh, that’s a neuron without all its dendrites so I can see the astrocyte wrapped around it.’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Campbell decided to embroider an astrocyte with looping tendrils “for the beauty of the shape,” she says. As she sewed, she also began to learn more about the cells, which perform a variety of crucial jobs in the brain, including healing injuries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cajal’s drawings are still relevant today, says Abbott. “What strikes me the most is how completely timeless they are.” Even with powerful, high-resolution microscopes, scientists today see cells in a similar way. “It’s almost depressing to think that even with all of this fancy equipment, we’re not all that far ahead,” she says. “But I like that. I like that there is this direct connection to 100 years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That thread ties the embroiderers today to Cajal’s work, Abbott says. “We are looking at the same thing and feeling the same sense of wonder.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;An upsurge of hot rock from deep beneath the Atlantic Ocean may be driving the continents on either side apart.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Americas are moving away from Europe and Africa by a few centimeters each year, as the tectonic plates underlying those continents drift apart. Researchers typically think tectonic plates separate as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/century/earth-history-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes&quot;&gt;the distant edges of those plates sink down into Earth’s mantle&lt;/a&gt;, creating a gap (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/13/21&lt;/em&gt;). Material from the upper mantle then seeps up through the rift between the plates to fill in the seafloor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But new seismic data from the Atlantic Ocean floor show that hot rock is welling up beneath a seafloor rift called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge from hundreds of kilometers deep in Earth’s mantle. This suggests that material rising up under the ridge is not just a passive response to tectonic plates sliding apart. Rather, deep rock pushing toward Earth’s surface &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03139-x&quot;&gt;may be driving a wedge between the plates that helps separate them&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report online January 27 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A better understanding of plate tectonics — which causes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/north-americas-largest-recorded-earthquake-helped-confirm-plate-tectonics&quot;&gt;earthquakes&lt;/a&gt; and volcanic eruptions — could help people better prepare for these natural disasters (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/3/17&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Matthew Agius, a seismologist at Roma Tre University in Rome, and colleagues glimpsed what’s happening beneath the Mid-Atlantic Ridge using 39 seismometers on the seafloor near a spot along the ridge between South America and Africa. Those sensors monitored rumbles from earthquakes around the world for about a year. Because the seismic waves from those quakes traveled deep through Earth’s mantle on their way to the seismometers, the recorded tremors contained clues about the location and movement of material far below the seafloor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In those signals, Agius’ team saw hints of material from Earth’s lower mantle, more than 600 kilometers below the seafloor, welling up toward the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. “This was completely unexpected,” Agius says, and it could be a powerful force for pushing apart the tectonic plates on either side of the rift.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s certainly an interesting observation,” says Jeroen Ritsema, a seismologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who was not involved in the work. But it’s hard to tell how much deep mantle upwelling contributes to Atlantic seafloor spreading, based on observations from only one group of seismometers near the equator, he says. It’s like “you’re looking through a keyhole, and you’re trying to see what’s in the living room and the bedroom and the kitchen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Observations at other locations along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, as well as other mid-ocean ridges around the world, could help determine whether deep mantle material surging up beneath these rifts really plays a major role in seafloor spreading.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-spider-uses-silk-lift-prey-50-times-its-own-weight-video"/>

		<updated>2021-02-03T20:41:54+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A family of spiders can catch prey many times their own weight by hitching silk lines to their quarry and hoisting the meaty prize up into the air.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tangle web spiders, in the Theridiidae family, are masters of using silk to amplify muscle power. Their webs are “a messy tangle,” says Gabriele Greco, who studies biological materials at the University of Trento in Italy. Silk strands slant and crisscross in a cobwebby scribble.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Filming how spiders hunt from such snarls, Greco and Trento colleague Nicola Pugno focused on the most spectacular scenarios: attacks on insects that weighed up to 50 times as much as the spiders themselves. The web makers, however, could win their battles, thanks to adroit fighting, venom and lots of prey-wrapping silk. Victorious spiders also attached &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2020.0907&quot;&gt;multiple silk threads to their prey bundle&lt;/a&gt; to haul the feast up to the web, Greco and Pugno report February 3 in &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Royal Society Interface.&lt;/em&gt; Yet oddly these threads never get pulled totally taut.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To analyze the spiders’ weight-hauling moves, the researchers set up lab boxes with black walls for easy observation of white silk. Inside each box went a Theridiidae species&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;either a triangulate cobweb spider (&lt;em&gt;Steatoda triangulosa&lt;/em&gt;) or a false black widow (&lt;em&gt;S. paykulliana&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In the wild, both species stretch some strands from the tangle down to the ground, anchoring the strand’s sticky end. When some small, edible creature such as an ant bumbles against the strand, it breaks loose from the ground and yanks the tiny morsel upward to flail helplessly in the air. Lunch!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What really interested Greco and Pugno, however, were reports of these strands occasionally catching “giant” prey, including a snake and a mouse. To give the food-catching silk an extreme workout, researchers used big cockroaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A single sticky-end strand can’t jerk a heavy roach into the air, so when prey bumps the silk, the resident spider rushes to add extra strands to its big catch. In the lab box tests, spiders had to add strand after strand before researchers saw the first upward lurch. During the whole raising process, the hauling threads still maintained some give instead of being stretched very tight. That makes sense, Greco concluded, because these strands get tugged and jounced a lot by struggling prey. Super tight strands might break.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Filmed in a lab box, a little &lt;em&gt;Steatoda&lt;/em&gt; spider tries to capture a much bigger roach to feast on. Spiders didn’t evolve pulleys with wheels for lifting massive loads, but tangle web spiders like these have a silky alternative. The spider attaches one silk strand after another to the struggling roach until the silk supports all of the roach’s weight. Then the spider keeps adding shorter and shorter strands that tug the monster weight of the prey up toward the main part of the web.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What these spiders have evolved isn’t a loading-dock pulley with a wheel, but attaching a sequence of silk strands gives the tiny animals their own way of lifting heavy burdens in little increments. After some 400 million years of evolution, spiders’ forms and uses of silk fascinate researchers like Greco, who are looking for new materials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new study of silk-based weight lifting strikes Symone Alexander, a chemical engineer with wide-ranging interests at Auburn University in Alabama, as “very cool.” The rounded, spoked webs on Halloween décor may be the popular notion of spider silk, but the animals have expanded the places and ways they can live with a wide range of silky innovations. Spiders have evolved silky trap doors, nets, lassos and — one close to Alexander’s heart — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/slingshot-spider-web-acceleration&quot;&gt;ultrafast slingshots&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN:3/6/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Even in a single web, there are different types of silk (and glue) used to make frame lines, capture lines and anchor lines,” she says. “Spiders are ingenious.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;An unusual mud-wrapped mummy is leading archaeologists to rethink how nonroyal Egyptians preserved their dead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CT scans of an Egyptian mummy from around 1200 B.C. reveal that &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245247&quot;&gt;the body is sheathed in a mud shell&lt;/a&gt; between its layers of linen wrappings. Ancient Egyptians may have used this preservation technique, never before seen in Egyptian archaeology, to repair damage to the mummified body and mimic royal burial customs, researchers report February 3 in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the mummy’s legs are caked with mud about 2.5 centimeters thick, the mud over its face is spread as thin as 1.5 millimeters. Chemical analyses of mud flakes from around the head indicate that the mud layer is covered in a white, possibly limestone-based pigment, topped with a red mineral paint.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leg fractures and other damage to the mummy’s body hint that the mud wrap may have been used to restore the body after it was desecrated, potentially by tomb robbers. Repairing the body would have ensured that the deceased could continue existing in the afterlife.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mud shell may also have been a poor man’s version of the expensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/origins-egyptian-mummy-making-may-predate-pyramids&quot;&gt;resin coatings&lt;/a&gt; seen on royal mummies of this era, the researchers suggest (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/18/14&lt;/em&gt;). “Status in Egyptian society was in large part measured by proximity to the king,” says Karin Sowada, an archaeologist at Macquarie University in Sydney. So imitating royal funerary practices may have been a display of social status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The identity and social standing of the mud-wrapped individual remains a mystery. Analyzing other nonroyal mummies from ancient Egypt may reveal how common mud shells were, who used them and why.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.connectedpapers.com/&quot;&gt;Connected Papers&lt;/a&gt; and now released as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXivLabs&lt;/a&gt; collaboration, the tool links to interactive visualizations of similar articles. Connected Papers graphs can help readers explore a visual overview of a new academic field, create a bibliography, discover the most relevant prior and derivative works of a paper, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers will find the feature below an article abstract in the “Related Papers” tab, as shown below. By activating the Connected Papers toggle switch, readers can follow a link to the article’s graph displayed at Connected Papers. Each paper’s graph is created by analyzing tens of thousands of papers for similarity in their citations, and then a small subset of those analyzed are arranged according to their degree of similarity. Each node in the graph represents an article, which has its own set of connected papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Connected Papers started as a weekend side project between friends, to solve our own problems with literature reviews,” said Eddie Smolyansky, co-founder of Connected Papers. “We can’t believe how quickly the scientific community embraced the tool and we’re so excited to be featured on arXiv – a website that we use daily in our own research. With this kind of support, we plan to keep improving Connected Papers and to build more tools for the academic community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework enabling innovative collaborations with individuals and organizations to bring innovative tools to the arXiv community, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;we welcome new proposals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size&quot;&gt;Albert Einstein’s mind reinvented space and time, foretelling a universe so bizarre and grand that it has challenged the limits of human imagination. An idea born in a Swiss patent office that evolved into a mature theory in Berlin set forth a radical new picture of the cosmos, rooted in a new, deeper understanding of gravity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Out was Newton’s idea, which had reigned for nearly two centuries, of masses that appeared to tug on one another. Instead, Einstein presented space and time as a unified fabric distorted by mass and energy. Objects warp the fabric of spacetime like a weight resting on a trampoline, and the fabric’s curvature guides their movements. With this insight, gravity was explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Einstein presented his general theory of relativity at the end of 1915 in a series of lectures in Berlin. But it wasn’t until a solar eclipse in 1919 that everyone took notice. His theory predicted that a massive object — say, the sun — could distort spacetime nearby enough to bend light from its straight-line course. Distant stars would thus appear not exactly where expected. Photographs taken during the eclipse verified that the position shift matched Einstein’s prediction. “Lights all askew in the heavens; men of science more or less agog,” declared a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; headline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even a decade later, a story in &lt;em&gt;Science News Letter&lt;/em&gt;, the predecessor of &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;, wrote of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/riots-understand-einstein-theory&quot;&gt;Riots to understand Einstein theory&lt;/a&gt;” (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/1/30, p. 79&lt;/em&gt;). Apparently extra police had to be called in to control a crowd of 4,500 who “broke down iron gates and mauled each other” at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City to hear an explanation of general relativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Science News 100&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3095150&quot; height=&quot;84&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/centennial-logo-800x84.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This article is an excerpt from a series celebrating some of the biggest advances in science over the last century. For an expanded version of the story of the universe, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime&quot;&gt;Century of Science: Our wild universe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-button aligncenter is-style-fill&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;wp-block-button__link has-white-color has-text-color has-background&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #004a7c;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;By 1931, physicist Albert A. Michelson, the first American to win a Nobel Prize in the sciences, called the theory “a revolution in scientific thought unprecedented in the history of science.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But for all the powers of divination we credit to Einstein today, he was a reluctant soothsayer. We now know that general relativity offered much more than Einstein was willing or able to see. “It was a profoundly different way of looking at the universe,” says astrophysicist David Spergel of the Simons Foundation’s Flatiron Institute in New York City, “and it had some wild implications that Einstein himself didn’t want to accept.” What’s more, says Spergel (a member of the Honorary Board of the Society for Science, publisher of &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;), “the wildest aspects of general relativity have all turned out to be true.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What had been masquerading as a quiet, static, finite place is instead a dynamic, ever-expanding arena filled with its own riot of space-bending beasts. Galaxies congregate in superclusters on scales vastly greater than anything experts had considered before the 20th century. Within those galaxies reside not only stars and planets, but also a zoo of exotic objects illustrating general relativity’s propensity for weirdness, including neutron stars, which pack a fat star’s worth of mass into the size of a city, and black holes, which pervert spacetime so strongly that no light can escape. And when these behemoths collide, they shake spacetime, blasting out ginormous amounts of energy. Our cosmos is violent, evolving and filled with science fiction–like possibilities that actually come straight out of general relativity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“General relativity opened up a huge stage of stuff for us to look at and try out and play with,” says astrophysicist Saul Perlmutter of the University of California, Berkeley. He points to the idea that the universe changes dramatically over its lifetime — “the idea of a lifetime of a universe at all is a bizarre concept” — and the idea that the cosmos is expanding, plus the thought that it could collapse and come to an end, and even that there might be other universes. “You get to realize that the world could be much more interesting even than we already ever imagined it could possibly be.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An expanding picture&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-columns&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einstein’s equations of general relativity were a wellspring from which our current view of the cosmos has flowed. That the theory continues to supply so many rich questions is part of what makes it “just incredible,” says David Spergel, an astrophysicist at the Simons Foundation’s Flatiron Institute in New York City. Over the last century, we’ve detected cosmic beasts that defy the imagination. We’ve also learned some crucial facts about our cosmos: The universe is expanding, and at an accelerating rate. The universe began with a bang 13.8 billion years ago. And mysterious forms of matter and energy are shaping the cosmos in unexpected and largely unknown ways. Read about some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/century/milestones?themes=3095867&quot;&gt;milestones in our expanding picture&lt;/a&gt;, including Vera Rubin’s contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Vera Rubin&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3095943&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021321_eq_universe_inline3_680-563x450.jpg&quot; width=&quot;563&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3095943&quot;&gt;Astronomer Vera Rubin’s measurements suggested the existence of dark matter in the 1970s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3095943&quot;&gt;Rubin Collection/AIP Emilio Segrè Visual Archives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;General relativity has become the foundation for today’s understanding of the cosmos. But the current picture is far from complete. Plenty of questions remain about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-claim-dama-cosine&quot;&gt;mysterious matter&lt;/a&gt; and forces, about the beginnings and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/book-end-everything-explores-ways-universe-could-perish&quot;&gt;the end of the universe&lt;/a&gt;, about how the science of the big meshes with quantum mechanics, the science of the very small. Some astronomers believe a promising route to answering some of those unknowns is another of general relativity’s initially underappreciated features — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/using-general-relativity-magnify-cosmos&quot;&gt;the power of bent light to magnify features of the cosmos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today’s scientists continue to poke and prod at general relativity to find clues to what they might be missing. General relativity is now being tested to a level of precision previously impossible, says astrophysicist Priyamvada Natarajan of Yale ​University. “General relativity expanded our cosmic view, then gave us sharper focus on the cosmos, and then turned the tables on it and said, ‘now we can test it much more strongly.’ ” It’s this testing that will perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis&quot;&gt;uncover problems&lt;/a&gt; with the theory that might point the way to a fuller picture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so, more than a century after general relativity debuted, there’s plenty left to foretell. The universe may turn out to be even wilder yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Ravenous beasts&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just over a century after Einstein unveiled general relativity, scientists obtained visual confirmation of one of its most impressive beasts. In 2019, a global network of telescopes revealed a mass warping spacetime with such fervor that nothing, not even light, could escape its snare. The Event Horizon Telescope &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope&quot;&gt;released the first image of a black hole&lt;/a&gt;, at the center of galaxy M87 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/27/19, p. 6&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image alignwide size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image of black hole in galaxy M87&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3095946&quot; height=&quot;580&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021321_eq_universe_inline1_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1030&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3095946&quot;&gt;In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration released this first-ever image of a black hole, at the heart of galaxy M87. The image shows the shadow of the monster surrounded by a bright disk of gas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3095946&quot;&gt;Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The power of an image is strong,” says Kazunori Akiyama, an astrophysicist at the MIT Haystack Observatory in Westford, Mass., who led one of the teams that created the image. “I somewhat expected that we might see something exotic,” Akiyama says. But after looking at the first image, “Oh my God,” he recalls thinking, “it’s just perfectly matching with our expectation of general relativity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a long time, black holes were mere mathematical curiosities. Evidence that they actually reside out in space didn’t start coming in until the second half of the 20th century. It’s a common story in the annals of physics. An oddity in some theorist’s equation points to a previously unknown phenomenon, which kicks off a search for evidence. Once the data are attainable, and if physicists get a little lucky, the search gives way to discovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the case of black holes, German physicist Karl Schwarzschild came up with a solution to Einstein’s equations near a single spherical mass, such as a planet or a star, in 1916, shortly after Einstein proposed general relativity. Schwarzschild’s math revealed how the curvature of spacetime would differ around stars of the same mass but increasingly smaller sizes — in other words, stars that were more and more compact. Out of the math came a limit to how small a mass could be squeezed. Then in the 1930s, J. Robert Oppenheimer and Hartland Snyder described what would happen if a massive star collapsing under the weight of its own gravity shrank past that critical size — today known as the “Schwarzschild radius” — reaching a point from which its light could never reach us. Still, Einstein — and most others — doubted that what we now call black holes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1968902?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents&quot;&gt;were plausible in reality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/50-years-later-its-hard-say-who-named-black-holes&quot;&gt;“black hole” first appeared in print in &lt;em&gt;Science News Letter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It was in a 1964 story by Ann Ewing, who was covering a meeting in Cleveland of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/18/64, p. 39&lt;/em&gt;). That’s also about the time that hints in favor of the reality of black holes started coming in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just a few months later, Ewing reported the discovery of quasars — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/quasars-are-crazy&quot;&gt;describing them&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Science News Letter&lt;/em&gt; as “the most distant, brightest, most violent, heaviest and most puzzling sources of light and radio waves” (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/15/64, p. 106&lt;/em&gt;). Though not linked to black holes at the time, quasars hinted at some cosmic powerhouses needed to provide such energy. The use of X-ray astronomy in the 1960s revealed new features of the cosmos, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/case-black-hole-cygnus-x-1&quot;&gt;bright beacons that could come from a black hole scarfing down a companion star&lt;/a&gt;. And the motions of stars and gas clouds near the centers of galaxies pointed to something exceedingly dense lurking within.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image alignwide size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Quasar illustration&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3095945&quot; height=&quot;580&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021321_eq_universe_inline2_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1030&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3095945&quot;&gt;Quasars (one illustrated) are so bright that they can outshine their home galaxies. Though baffling when first discovered, these outbursts are powered by massive, feeding black holes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3095945&quot;&gt;Mark Garlick/Science Source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Black holes stand out among other cosmic beasts for how extreme they are. The largest are many billion times the mass of the sun, and when they rip a star apart, they can spit out particles with 200 trillion electron volts of energy. That’s some 30 times the energy of the protons that race around the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As evidence built into the 1990s and up to today, scientists realized these great beasts not only exist, but also help shape the cosmos. “These objects that general relativity predicted, that were mathematical curiosities, became real, then they were marginal. Now they’ve become central,” says Natarajan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We now know supermassive black holes reside at the centers of most if not all galaxies, where they generate outflows of energy that affect how and where stars form. “At the center of the galaxy, they define everything,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though visual confirmation is recent, it feels as though black holes have long been familiar. They are a go-to metaphor for any unknowable space, any deep abyss, any endeavor that consumes all our efforts while giving little in return.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Real black holes, of course, have given plenty back: answers about our cosmos plus new questions to ponder, wonder and entertainment for space fanatics, a lost album from Weezer, numerous episodes of &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt;, the Hollywood blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For physicist Nicolas Yunes of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, black holes and other cosmic behemoths continue to amaze. “Just thinking about the dimensions of these objects, how large they are, how heavy they are, how dense they are,” he says, “it’s really breathtaking.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;In 2019, scientists gave us the first real picture of the supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy M87. How? We explain.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Spacetime waves&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When general relativity’s behemoths collide, they disrupt the cosmic fabric. Ripples in spacetime called gravitational waves emanate outward, a calling card of a tumultuous and most energetic tango.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Einstein’s math predicted such waves could be created, not only by gigantic collisions but also by explosions and other accelerating bodies. But for a long time, spotting any kind of spacetime ripple was a dream beyond measure. Only the most dramatic cosmic doings would create signals that were large enough for direct detection. Einstein, who called the waves &lt;em&gt;gravitationswellen&lt;/em&gt;, was unaware that any such big events existed in the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image alignwide size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Gravitational waves illustration&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3095942&quot; height=&quot;579&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021321_eq_universe_inline4_1030.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1030&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3095942&quot;&gt;Gravitational waves ripple away from two black holes that orbit each other before merging (shown in this simulation). The merging black holes created a new black hole that’s much larger than those found in previous collisions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3095942&quot;&gt;Deborah Ferguson, Karan Jani, Deirdre Shoemaker and Pablo Laguna/Georgia Tech, Maya Collaboration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beginning in the 1950s, when others were still arguing whether gravitational waves existed in reality, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-road-detecting-gravity-waves&quot;&gt;physicist Joseph Weber&lt;/a&gt; sunk his career into trying to detect them. After a decade-plus effort, he claimed detection in 1969, identifying an apparent signal perhaps from a supernova or from a newly discovered type of rapidly spinning star called a pulsar. In the few years after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/gravitational-waves-detected&quot;&gt;reporting the initial find&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt; published more than a dozen stories on what it began calling the “Weber problem” (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/21/69, p. 593&lt;/em&gt;). Study after study could not confirm the results. What’s more, no sources of the waves could be found. A 1973 headline read, “The deepening doubt about Weber’s waves” (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/26/73, p. 338&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Weber stuck by his claim until his death in 2000, but his waves were never verified. Nonetheless, scientists increasingly believed gravitational waves would be found. In 1974, radio astronomers Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor spotted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/going-circles-pulsar&quot;&gt;neutron star orbiting a dense companion&lt;/a&gt;. Over the following years, the neutron star and its companion appeared to be getting closer together by the distance that would be expected if they were losing energy to gravitational waves. Scientists soon spoke not of the Weber problem, but of what equipment could possibly pick up the waves. “Now, although they have not yet seen, physicists believe,” Dietrick E. Thomsen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/trying-rock-gravitys-vibes&quot;&gt;wrote in &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt; in 1984&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/4/84, p. 76&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was a different detection strategy, decades in the making, that would provide the needed sensitivity. The Advanced Laser Interferometry Gravitational-wave Observatory, or LIGO, which reported the first confirmed gravitational waves in 2016, relies on two detectors, one in Hanford, Wash., and one in Livingston, La. Each detector splits the beam of a powerful laser in two, with each beam traveling down one of the detector’s two arms. In the absence of gravitational waves, the two beams recombine and cancel each other out. But if gravitational waves stretch one arm of the detector while squeezing the other, the laser light no longer matches up.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The machines are an incredible feat of engineering. Even spacetime ripples detected from colliding black holes might stretch an arm of the LIGO detector by as little as one ten-thousandth of the width of a proton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the first detection, from two colliding black holes, was announced, the discovery was heralded as the beginning of a new era in astronomy. It was &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-top-science-stories-2016&quot;&gt;story of the year in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and such a big hit that the pioneers of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-explained&quot;&gt;LIGO detector&lt;/a&gt; won the Nobel Prize in physics the following year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists with LIGO and another gravitational wave detector, Virgo, based in Italy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo&quot;&gt;have by now logged dozens more detections&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/30/21, p. 30&lt;/em&gt;). Most of the waves have emanated from mergers of black holes, though a few events have featured neutron stars. Smashups so far have revealed the previously unknown &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gravitational-waves&quot;&gt;birthplaces of some heavy elements&lt;/a&gt; and pointed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colliding-neutron-stars-light-speed-space&quot;&gt;a bright jet of charged subatomic particles&lt;/a&gt; that could offer clues to mysterious flashes of high-energy light known as gamma-ray bursts. The waves also have revealed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-gravitational-waves-midsize-black-hole-collision-ligo-virgo&quot;&gt;midsize black holes, between 100 and 100,000 times the sun’s mass, do in fact exist&lt;/a&gt; — along with reconfirming that Einstein was right, at least so far.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Virgo facility in Italy&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3095941&quot; height=&quot;510&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021321_eq_universe_inline5_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3095941&quot;&gt;Researchers at two gravitational wave observatories, LIGO in the United States and Virgo in Italy (shown), have reported dozens of detections of black hole smashups, as well as neutron star mergers, in the last five years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3095941&quot;&gt;The Virgo Collaboration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just five years in, some scientists are already eager for something even more exotic. In a &lt;em&gt;Science News &lt;/em&gt;article about detecting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-circling-wormhole-weird-gravitational-waves&quot;&gt;black holes orbiting wormholes&lt;/a&gt; via gravitational waves, physicist Vítor Cardoso of Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon, Portugal, suggested a coming shift to more unusual phenomena: “We need to look for strange but exciting signals,” he said (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/29/20, p. 12&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gravitational wave astronomy is truly only at its beginnings. Improved sensitivity at existing Earth-based detectors will turn up the volume on gravitational waves, allowing detections from less energetic and more distant sources. Future detectors, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/satellite-trio-will-hunt-gravitational-waves-space&quot;&gt;the space-based LISA&lt;/a&gt;, planned for launch in the 2030s, will get around the troublesome noise that interferes when Earth’s surface shakes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps the most exciting thing would be to observe a small black hole falling into a big black hole, an extreme mass ratio inspiraling,” Yunes says. In such an event, the small black hole would zoom back and forth, back and forth, swirling in different directions as it followed wildly eccentric orbits, perhaps for years. That could offer the ultimate test of Einstein’s equations, revealing whether we truly understand how spacetime is warped in the extreme.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/03/supposed-benefits-of-psychedelic-microdosing-to-mental-health-may-actually-reflect-strong-placebo-response/"/>

		<updated>2021-02-03T12:12:32+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An increasingly large body of work suggests that many illicit psychoactive drugs could be useful as treatments for certain mental health problems. Studies have found, for instance, that the psychedelics psilocybin (from magic mushrooms) and LSD can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00187-9&quot;&gt;reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression&lt;/a&gt;, while MDMA may be useful in treating PTSD.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a different story for a practice known as “microdosing”, however. This involves taking a small quantity of a psychedelic substance — normally too little to produce any perceptible effects — repeatedly over a period of time (every few days for several weeks, say). And &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/08/14/lack-of-scientific-proof-that-microdosing-psychedelic-drugs-improves-wellbeing-or-creativity/&quot;&gt;as we reported in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, although results from some surveys or poorly-controlled trials suggest that microdosing can improve people’s mood or certain aspects of cognition, more rigorous placebo-controlled trials have failed to find any such effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81446-7&quot;&gt;new study in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; could explain why. The team, led by Laura Kartner from Imperial College London, finds that people who plan on microdosing do go on to experience a boost to wellbeing and a reduction in anxiety and depression. But the level of improvement depends on how much they &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;/em&gt; to improve in the first place, suggesting that any effects on wellbeing may be the result of a strong placebo response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41297&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 253 people who were planning on microdosing a psychedelic drug such as psilocybin, LSD, or ayahuasca. In the week before the participants began microdosing, they completed a survey about their expectations, indicating how confident they were that the experience would have a positive effect, for instance, and how successful they thought it would be in improving their wellbeing. They also completed a number of other scales, including measures of wellbeing, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and personality traits. Then, once they began microdosing, participants completed weekly measures of wellbeing, depression, and anxiety, and recorded how much of the drug they had taken and whether they had experienced any psychoactive effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that after participants started microdosing, their wellbeing increased and symptoms of depression and anxiety decreased. Most of these effects emerged in the first week of taking the drugs, then remained at a similar level for the rest of the four week period. But, importantly, their expectations in the week before beginning to take the drug predict the extent of these changes: those who had a greater expectation that microdosing would produce positive effects tended to show more positive changes in all three measures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it might seem like the study supports the use of microdosing. But the fact that people’s expectations were tied to their response suggests that what seems like a useful therapeutic effect might actually be a placebo effect, driven by what participants want or expect to occur. That could explain why previous placebo-controlled studies have found that microdosing doesn’t produce any beneficial response beyond that of a placebo. Of course, in this case there was no placebo arm of the study, so it’s impossible to tell for sure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors also posit one other intriguing possibility: that the drugs do produce a pharmacological effect in the brain at this low dose, but this doesn’t boost wellbeing — instead, it actually accentuates the placebo response. For instance, microdosing might promote “plasticity” in the brain — the ability to reorganise networks and form new pathways — and this could potentially make any expectation effects even more pronounced. Again, only well-controlled trials will be able to determine whether that’s the case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whatever’s going on in the brain during microdosing, it’s clearly worth further examination. But as this study shows, in the absence of more rigorous research, there’s good reason to be sceptical of bold claims about the benefits of microdosing to people’s mental health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81446-7&quot;&gt;Positive expectations predict improved mental-health outcomes linked to psychedelic microdosing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is not intended to be any kind of prediction of the future; it is more an extended reflection after 20 years reporting on the OA movement, coupled with a heavy dose of speculation. Who knows, perhaps this will be the last thing I ever write on open access. Maybe this will prove my swan song.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I would also like to stress upfront that in the critique of the OA movement I make I don’t claim that my knowledge, or predictions, are superior to anyone else’s. This is just what I have concluded after many years observing the movement and reflects my current view on where I think we are today. It does also include a lot of factual data, as well as links and footnotes for those who like them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Importantly, while I do not consider myself to be an OA advocate, I admit that I was as naïve as anyone else about what the movement might be able to achieve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, while what I say might be slightly overweight in European developments, it may not matter if (as I believe is possible) events in Europe end up determining how open access develops globally. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I say this because it seems possible that European OA initiatives will reconfigure the international scholarly communication system, and in ways that OA advocates will not be comfortable with. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I would add that the main focus is on science publishing rather than HSS. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;To read/download my new eBook please click &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/information-wants-to-be-free_20210101/mode/2up&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;The file can also be downloaded &lt;a href=&quot;https://richardpoynder.co.uk/Information_Wants_to_be_Free.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (Health warning: it is 163 pages long). &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;A short review of the eBook has been posted on R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;eddit &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Open_Science/comments/kmh09a/open_access_information_wants_to_be_free_richard/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;ftn1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As anyone who’s ever flunked a test will tell you, doing well at school or university isn’t just a simple matter of intelligence, ability, or even of how hard you’ve worked. In fact, there are plenty of things that can affect the way we perform, from the way we &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/04/what-do-todays-students-get-right-and-wrong-in-how-they-take-lecture-notes/&quot;&gt;take notes&lt;/a&gt; to how we &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/10/these-two-revision-strategies-can-prepare-you-for-an-exam-much-better-than-just-restudying-your-notes/&quot;&gt;revise&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/10/for-faster-learning-and-longer-retention-interleave-study-sessions-with-sleep/&quot;&gt;how much sleep we get&lt;/a&gt; while we’re studying.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-30956-001&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: General&lt;/em&gt;, something else might have an impact on our educational achievements: our assumptions about our professors. If we believe they have faith in our ability to change and improve, suggest Katherine Muenks from the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues, we’re likely to enjoy classes more, as well as achieve higher grades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41286&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research focused on participants’ beliefs about mindset. Those with a &lt;em&gt;fixed &lt;/em&gt;mindset believe that intelligence or ability is innate and can’t be changed; those with a &lt;em&gt;growth&lt;/em&gt; mindset believe that ability is malleable, and that if we work hard or adopt new strategies we will grow and learn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that our own mindset is likely to have an impact on how we behave, how motivated we feel, and what we achieve. But the new study looked at how students’ perceptions of their STEM professors’ mindset affected their experience and engagement in classes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first experiment, participants watched a short video clip from the first day of a university calculus course in which a professor expressed his beliefs about what it took to do well in the class. In one condition, the professor expressed beliefs suggesting a fixed mindset (“You either have the skills or you don’t”), in another expressed growth mindset beliefs (“The assignments are designed to help you improve your skills”), and in the third expressed no mindset beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those who watched the fixed mindset video anticipated feeling significantly less belonging and less engagement in the class than those who were shown the growth mindset video, and expressed more concerns about being evaluated negatively. Meanwhile, those who watched the growth mindset video anticipated higher engagement in and effort towards the class than either the fixed mindset group or the control group, and expected to perform significantly better than their fixed mindset group counterparts. In a second study, replicating the first, growth mindset group participants also reported lower levels of impostor feelings and less likelihood of dropping the course.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The third study looked at how students felt about their professors’ mindset beliefs in the real world. Participants who were enrolled in STEM courses at three US universities completed a survey reporting their perceptions of their professors’ mindset beliefs, and provided their personal mindset beliefs and SAT scores. They then completed surveys measuring engagement and psychological experiences as in the previous two studies. As expected, those who saw their professors as having fixed mindset beliefs had greater concerns about the course, greater feelings of being an impostor, and increased negative affect in classes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A final longitudinal study replicated these results, also finding that participants who felt their professor had fixed mindset beliefs were more likely to skip class than those who felt their professor had a growth mindset. There was also an indirect effect on actual performance in class: those who believed their professor had a fixed mindset felt less of a sense of belonging, which in turn predicted lower grades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mindset beliefs are clearly hugely important, both in terms of how people experience the classroom and their outcomes at the end of a course. But while changing student mindset beliefs may go some way to improving learning, it’s not enough — as the team suggests, the learning environment itself might need to change. Staff could be informed of the potential impact of their mindset beliefs, for instance, and be encouraged to help students adapt to particular courses or new skills.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other studies have also suggested that women and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/09/first-generation-university-students-are-at-greater-risk-of-experiencing-imposter-syndrome/&quot;&gt;first-generation university students are at greater risk of experiencing impostor syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, particularly within STEM courses. Building confidence and reducing impostor feelings and psychological vulnerability could therefore improve not only student outcomes but diversity in STEM fields more generally — a serious incentive for teaching staff to think about their mindsets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-30956-001&quot;&gt;Does my professor think my ability can change? Students’ perceptions of their STEM professors’ mindset beliefs predict their psychological vulnerability, engagement, and performance in class.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Nephrologists want every patient on chronic hemodialysis to have a more permanent type of vascular access such as a fistula or graft, but for some patients, this is not suitable or they may require a catheter while a fistula or graft is developing. In the United States in 2018, more than four out of every five patients receiving hemodialysis were using a fistula or graft (82.4%; 65.7% fistula and 16.7% graft). Meaning about 17.6% were using a catheter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the time spent on trouble-shooting catheter malfunction or dealing with bloodstream infections, I’m always looking for new ways to prevent these complications related to catheters.  An &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02243-y&quot;&gt;article by Richtrova &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;, published last week in &lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt;, looked at whether rt-PA vs trisodium citrate would prevent catheter-related bloodstream infections, catheter malfunction, or catheter non-function. It was a small study with only 18 patients, with the authors originally planning to recruit 80 patients. However, the recruitment rates are not unexpected given the efforts to keep catheter use low and increase fistula and graft use. Even with the small numbers, there are some findings worth keeping in mind. There was no reduction in the incidence of catheter malfunction/non-function or catheter-related bloodstream infections, but the overall incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections was low in their population. Catheter patency (also known as being unobstructed) was more related to the time interval between sessions and if there were prior catheter malfunctions as opposed to the use of agents. The longer period without the use of a catheter will predispose catheter thrombosis leading to malfunction or non-function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no reduction in the incidence of catheter malfunction/non-function or catheter-related bloodstream infections, but the overall incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections was low&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other agents have been used to prevent thrombosis leading to catheter dysfunction. The most common anticoagulant locking solutions (meaning solutions used to fill catheters in between hemodialysis sessions to prevent clotting) are heparin and 4% citrate. In fact, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asdin.org/page/A2&quot;&gt;American Society of Diagnostic Interventional Nephrologists&lt;/a&gt; recommends that both heparin and 4% citrate are acceptable catheter locks. Thrombolytic agents like rt-PA have been looked at before. It has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://adc.bmj.com/content/92/6/499&quot;&gt;previously shown&lt;/a&gt; that rt-PA is significantly more effective than heparin in preventing clot formation in hemodialysis catheters. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1011376&quot;&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; previously compared rt-PA to heparin as a locking solution, concluding that there was a significantly reduced incidence of catheter malfunction and bacteremia. So why not switch to rt-PA as a locking solution for one out of three sessions per week? First, there is an issue of cost. Overall, nephrologists tend to use rt-PA as a treatment to fix the catheter when it stops working rather than as a prevention strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though there are significant efforts to have a more permanent vascular access such as a fistula or graft, there are individuals that can only dialyze via a catheter. Since dialysis vascular access is a lifeline for hemodialysis patients, we should continue to look at options for maintenance and optimization of catheter function. The complications related to catheters, especially infections, have an unfavorable effect on morbidity, mortality, and cost. In addition, infections are the second most frequent cause of death in dialysis patients. This is why I’m always on the lookout for ways to preserve my patient’s catheter function.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first of many planned for 2021, these workshops – co-hosted by the NIH BRAIN Initiative and Department of Energy (DOE) – will bring together &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;experts to discuss neural circuit mapping, connectomics, and challenges in whole-brain mapping. Please join us on Feb. 5 and 17, and March 5, 17, and 31&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-3012&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NIH BRAIN Initiative recently partnered with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.energy.gov/science/office-science&quot;&gt;Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science&lt;/a&gt; to organize five workshops on brain connectivity. Following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/strategic-planning/acd-working-groups/brain-initiative%C2%AE-20-cells-circuits-toward-cures&quot;&gt;findings of the BRAIN 2.0 reports&lt;/a&gt;, this series will bring together researchers with broad expertise to discuss state-of-the-art technologies in mapping complete neural circuits, opportunities to advance connectomics, and challenges to creating detailed maps of brain connectivity – “wiring diagrams” spanning the entire mammalian brain. Ultimately, together with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/brain-programs/cell-census-network-biccn&quot;&gt;BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network&lt;/a&gt; cell-type “parts list”, these diagrams will advance our understanding of brain circuitry and function, and drive innovations in data science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workshops are open to anyone and will be livestreamed on NIH Videocast. You can view the them live at &lt;a href=&quot;https://videocast.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;https://videocast.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt; on the day of the event. Each workshop will take place from 11:00 AM – 4:00 PM (EST).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This workshop will explore the potential impact of generating detailed maps of brain connectivity spanning the entire mammalian brain. Invited speakers will discuss the value of mapping connectomes across species (e.g., drosophila, zebrafish, songbirds), retina connectomics, and how rodent connectomes inform our understanding of learning and behavior. There will also be a panel discussion on the importance of the whole mouse brain connectome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mozart famously started playing the piano and composing while still a young child. But if he hadn’t started musical practice then, would his future achievements have been as impressive? Is there, in other words, a “sensitive period” in which the brain is especially susceptible to musical stimulation, and during which a person must start to acquire musical skills in order to achieve their full potential — as is the case for visual perception, say, or language acquisition? There has been a lot of debate about this, but now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620959014&quot;&gt;major new study&lt;/a&gt; of professional musicians and identical and non-identical twins in Sweden suggests not. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41275&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 310 musicians studied by Laura Wesseldijk at the Karolinska Institute and colleagues were all either professionally active or students at a music college. They were aged between 27 and 54 (to match the age range of the twin sample) and had started musical training between the ages of two and 18. These participants reported on when they started that training and how many hours a week they had spent in music practice up to the age of 18, as well as in adulthood. Their musical aptitude was measured using an online test of ability to discriminate pitch, melody and rhythm. They also reported on their level of musical achievement, giving details of how many works they had composed and had performed, any radio or TV recordings, and any music awards, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The twin data came from the Swedish Twin Registry. Some 7,786 twins reported having played music at some point in their lives, and of these, 4,814 had taken the same musical discrimination test, and 4,887 had provided information on their musical achievement (giving details of any compositions and amateur performances, or awards, for instance).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team did indeed find that for both the professionals and twins, those who’d started their musical training before the age of 8 went on to develop greater musical aptitude &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; higher levels of achievement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, when the researchers took total lifetime hours of practice into account, only the link with musical aptitude remained — and it became limited. Starting training at a younger age was associated with better pitch — but not rhythm — discrimination. (This tallies with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5895917/&quot;&gt;some recent work&lt;/a&gt; finding that children who received musical training before the age of 7 did better on melody, but not rhythm, tests than children who’d started their training later.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And when the researchers looked more closely at the twin data (by considering, for example, pairs of identical twins who had started musical training at different ages, and data for identical vs nonidentical twins), they found that the association between starting training earlier and doing better later could be fully explained by shared genetic and environmental factors . That is, there was no need to invoke a “sensitive period” to explain why kids who start musical training in early childhood tend to do better later, but instead musicians (professional or amateur) who start tuition earlier and do better on the tests later may have benefitted from inheriting “musical” genes from their parents &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; from growing up in a musical environment at home. Their parents may have been better able to spot and foster musical talent in the children, and organised tuition for these children at a younger age, which made for more lifetime practice hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, the new results “provide little direct support that early training has a specific, causal effect on later performance and achievement,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are other fields — notably sport — in which it’s also been suggested that there’s a sensitive period for training in childhood, to maximise later performance. However, findings in this area have been mixed, too. Some studies that have found a benefit to starting early have failed to take into account total lifetime hours of practice, the researchers point out. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27923322/&quot;&gt;One 2017 study of athletes&lt;/a&gt; even found that those who’d won medals had specialised in their main sport significantly later than non-medallists (though they had been involved in other sports for longer).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the field of music, starting early is clearly associated with better later performance. But if you’re worrying that perhaps you’ve missed a critical window of greater brain responsiveness for your own child to start musical training, the lesson from the new work seems to be: don’t.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620959014&quot;&gt;Why Is an Early Start of Training Related to Musical Skills in Adulthood? A Genetically Informative Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creating a 3D atlas of nerve innervation in the pancreas…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instinct and experience drive the cortical plasticity needed for maternal behavior…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new central amygdala fear circuit…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shedding light on visual discrimination circuits in primates….&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-2988&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists create a whole-organ 3D atlas of pancreatic nerve fibers in diabetes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islets are groups of cells in the pancreas that are important for glucose metabolism. Pancreatic islets contain several types of cells, including insulin-producing β cells. Previous studies have shown that islet cells receive dense input from nerve fibers and that this innervation controls blood glucose; thus, elucidating the detailed anatomy of the pancreas in diabetes may provide new insights into metabolic disease. The pancreas, however, is highly heterogeneous and our understanding of its anatomy and function remains incomplete. Here, &lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/stanleylab/meet-the-team/&quot;&gt;Dr. Sarah Stanley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;external link&quot; class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540&quot; style=&quot;height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;&quot; title=&quot;This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and her research team at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33036983/&quot;&gt;used tissue clearing and whole-organ imaging to create a high-resolution 3D atlas of pancreatic nerve fibers and identified a new mechanism of neural input remodeling in diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, researchers used the tissue clearing technique iDISCO&lt;sup&gt;+ &lt;/sup&gt;and 3D volume imaging and analysis to determine the distribution of β cells, glucagon-producing α cells, and neurofilament 200 kDa (NF200)-positive input fibers in the pancreata of healthy and diabetic mice. NF200 is a neuronal marker that is thought to reflect neural remodeling. They also examined islet and nerve structure in pancreatic tissue from five healthy and three diabetic human donors. Dr. Stanley and her colleagues found that the innervation of the endocrine pancreas was enriched in healthy mice, and innervated islets were larger than non-innervated islets in healthy mice and humans. Islet nerve density and NF200 were increased in the islets of two mouse models of diabetes. Also, nerve density and the proportion of innervated islets was increased in pancreatic tissue from diabetic humans compared to healthy subjects. Researchers also suspected that nerve innervation may change during the development of diabetes. To address this, they used streptozotocin (STZ), a drug that is toxic to β cells, in mice to induce diabetes and found that islet nerve density increased over time compared to control mice. Overall, these findings show that nerve input into islets is maintained in diabetic humans and may be remodeled during disease development. This work constitutes a “3D atlas of pancreatic nerve innervation”, serving as a tool for researchers to quantify β cell mass, define islets, map pancreatic innervation, and assess the interaction between islets and innervation across species. Altogether, this work may help further our understanding of diabetes and lead to novel treatment targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maternal responses to the cries of pups are driven by both innate and plastic mechanisms &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brains of mammals seem to be hardwired to respond to the cries of our infants. However, a virgin mouse will not respond to the cries of another’s pups until she is co-housed with a dam and her litter. This suggests that there may be a re-wiring of the auditory cortex during this experience that enables pup retrieval behavior. But what enables this tuning of the brain to the cries of pups? Here, the lab of &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/robert-c-froemke&quot;&gt;Dr. Robert Froemke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;external link&quot; class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540&quot; style=&quot;height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;&quot; title=&quot;This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and his team at New York University recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33029014/&quot;&gt;demonstrated that after co-housing with pups, cortical plasticity and the oxytocin system rapidly re-tuned neurons in the auditory cortex of virgin mice.&lt;/a&gt; The virgin mice also learned to recognize pup cries and retrieve pups. Thus, neural mechanisms triggered by pup experience build upon hard-wired instincts, and drive parenting behavior. In the study, researchers co-housed virgin female mice with a dam and her litter, and then assessed cortical re-tuning. First, they determined the inter-syllable intervals at which females responded to pups and established a library of both prototypical pup calls and morphed calls for later playback procedures. Then, using two-photon imaging and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; voltage-clamp recordings, they found that excitatory and inhibitory tuning and synaptic responses were altered by maternal experience. Next, they expressed the calcium indicator GCaMP6f in either excitatory or inhibitory neurons in the auditory cortex of virgins and monitored temporal tuning throughout co-housing. This revealed that co-housing results in the coordinated plasticity of neuronal tuning. Finally, the researchers optogenetically inhibited hypothalamic oxytocin neurons of virgin females, co-housed those females with a dam and her litter, during the playback of various pup calls. They found that the oxytocin system is required for the re-tuning of cortical neurons. Altogether, these data demonstrate the importance of central oxytocin in synaptic plasticity processes within the auditory cortex for maternal behavior. Further, this study illustrates how the cortex tunes to the vocalizations of pups. While both experience and innate mechanisms are necessary for the development of maternal behavior, these data provide new insight into how the brain learns maternal skills.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identification of a new fear circuit from the central amygdala to the globus pallidus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it has long been known that the amygdala is central to fear and emotional learning, the exact organization and function of its long-range outputs remain elusive. The central amygdala (CeA) is classically thought of as the output zone of the amygdala complex, but how do CeA projections modulate fear learning? Recently, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bolilab.labsites.cshl.edu/&quot;&gt;Dr. Bo Li&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;external link&quot; class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540&quot; style=&quot;height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;&quot; title=&quot;This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and his team from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) and Stanford University sought to answer this question. In their new paper, the researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33067362/&quot;&gt;showed that the CeA projects to the globus pallidus (GPe) in order to relay information about a stimulus to regulate fear learning&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, they found that a subpopulation of CeA-GPe projections conveys information about the unconditioned stimulus (US) during auditory fear conditioning. During fear conditioning, the US is the electrical foot shock, whereas the stimulus that elicits a fear response (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;, freezing behavior) after it is paired with the US (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;, a tone) is called the conditioned stimulus. Researchers were interested in the inhibitory somatostatin positive (Sst+) neurons within the CeA and whether their circuitry helps regulate fear learning. To investigate this, Dr. Li’s team used a combination of state-of-the-art neuroscience techniques such as anatomical tract tracing, optogenetic modulation, fiber photometry, &lt;em&gt;in vitro &lt;/em&gt;electrophysiology, and fluorescent &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; hybridization in male and female mice. First, using retrograde cholera toxin B tracers, they confirmed that the CeA sends a subpopulation of neuronal projections to the GPe. Using sophisticated labeling procedures, they next showed that the vast majority of GPe-projecting CeA neurons express Sst.  Anterograde tracing also demonstrated that projections from the CeA to the GPe originate predominantly from Sst+ neurons. Using a tetanus toxin light chain (TeLC) viral method, they also showed that blocking neurotransmission within CeA-GPe projections abolished conditioned freezing, indicating that these projections are necessary for fear learning. Fiber photometry revealed that these projections are specifically relaying information about the US during auditory fear conditioning. Further, optogenetically inhibiting or activating GPe-projecting CeA neurons during US presentation blocked or promoted fear learning, respectively, demonstrating that these projections are essential for fear memory formation. Altogether, this team showed that a new CeA-GPe projection is critical for fear memory regulation. These data are critical for characterizing the circuits controlling fear learning-related behaviors, which is an important step toward the development of circuit-based therapeutics following aversive experiences.

Retrograde tracing with cholera toxin B (CTB; red) combined with fluorescent in situ labeling procedures show that most CeA-to-GPe neurons (93 ± 3%) express somatostatin (Sst; green) and not PKC-delta (Prkcd; white). A nuclear counterstain (DAPI; blue) was also used to visualize cell bodies.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The macaque ventrolateral prefrontal cortex boosts inferior temporal cortex population coding to allow rapid object recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the prefrontal cortex has long been known for its role in cognition and emotional processing, it is also critical for visual perception. There is also an emerging role for the inferior temporal cortex (IT) in object discrimination. But how do these two regions interact to enable the recognition of objects? Studying the computational functions within cortical circuits is critical in developing the next generation of models of visual intelligence, which will enable us to understand fundamental behaviors such as object recognition and discrimination. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dicarlolab.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;Dr. James DiCarlo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;external link&quot; class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540&quot; style=&quot;height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;&quot; title=&quot;This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website.

Their new study &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33080226/&quot;&gt;illustrates the role of connections between the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and the primate ventral visual cortex in robust core visual object recognition&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, they were interested in testing whether the vlPFC is an important node in the visual object processing network by pharmacologically inactivating this region and simultaneously recording IT activity with Utah electrode arrays in macaques. They found that reversible, pharmacological inactivation of the vlPFC with muscimol reduced the quality of the IT population code and resulted in deteriorations in object discrimination performance. During the visual discrimination task, this effect of silencing the vlPFC was significantly higher for the late-solved images than for the early-solved images. They also found that inactivation of the vlPFC reduced IT late-phase neuronal population activity. These results suggest that vlPFC is part of a recurrent neural circuit that boosts the performance of the ventral visual processing stream, as opposed to shallow feedforward systems. Studies such as this will one day help to elucidate a complete, mechanistic understanding of visual object recognition, from images to behavior, at the level of the neuron.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swearing, drinking, or making social transgressions are not behaviours we generally think of as good. &lt;/strong&gt;But in some cases, these kinds of “bad” behaviours can have benefits, both for ourselves and others. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/five-ways-bad-behaviour-can-benefit-you-and-others-154004&quot;&gt;Richard Stephens explains why&lt;/a&gt; at&lt;em&gt; The Conversation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41257&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jan/23/analgesic-culture-can-reframing-pain-make-it-go-away&quot;&gt;Margee Kerr and Linda Rodriguez McRobbie write&lt;/a&gt; that we need to rethink our approach to pain. &lt;/strong&gt;We currently have a “socially dysfunctional relationship” with pain, they argue: we rely too much on painkillers, and don’t appreciate that changing the way we think about painful experiences can also have an analgesic effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you make new friends in the middle of a pandemic? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/23/at-home/find-and-keep-new-friends.html&quot;&gt;Katherine Cusumano has some tips&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people have argued that public health messages should use shocking images of illness and death to drive home the importance of staying home and socially distancing. &lt;/strong&gt;But there’s reason to doubt the effectiveness of disturbing photos in convincing people of the dangers of the pandemic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-shocking-images-persuade-doubters-of-covids-dangers/&quot;&gt;write Nathan Ballantyne, Jared Celniker and Peter Ditto&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;. Their study showed that such images did little to change people’s opinion about the virus, even though participants believed they would.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a recent study, older adults who took afternoon naps showed superior performance on certain tests of language and memory&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/afternoon-naps-linked-to-improved-cognitive-function/&quot;&gt;reports Frankie Macpherson&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus&lt;/em&gt;. But there are plenty of caveats, not least that the correlational data means that no firm conclusions can be made about the direction of the relationship between taking naps and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another study has highlighted the toll of the coronavirus pandemic on mental health. &lt;/strong&gt;The vast majority of students surveyed at seven American universities last spring reported moderate or high levels of emotional distress, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-us-college-students-mental-health&quot;&gt;reports Sujata Gupta&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;. The psychological impact was particularly prominent among certain groups, including women, Asian participants, and those on lower incomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s common for women to experience worries and anxieties during pregnancy, and some pregnant women may end up meeting the criteria for a full-blown anxiety disorder. &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;Psyche&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-manage-your-worries-and-fears-during-pregnancy&quot;&gt;Pamela Wiegartz has written a guide&lt;/a&gt; with strategies for managing feelings of anxiety during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;

What do these massive research programs have in common? Both efforts were conducted by large multidisciplinary teams at non-traditional research institutions: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/bluebrain/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Blue Brain Project&lt;/a&gt; based in Lausanne, Switzerland and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Allen Institute for Brain Science&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BIG SCIENCE is the wave of the future, and the future is now.&lt;/b&gt; Actually, that future started 15-20 years ago. The question should be, is there a future for any other kind of neuroscience? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite a superficial “BIG SCIENCE” similarity, the differences between funding sources, business models, leadership, operation, and goals of Blue Brain and the Allen Institute are substantial. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Markram&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Henry Markram&lt;/a&gt;, the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/human-brain-project-votes-for-leadership-change-1.17060&quot;&gt;charismatic but divisive&lt;/a&gt;” visionary behind Blue Brain (and the €1 billion Human Brain Project) has been criticized for his “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/human-brain-project-votes-for-leadership-change-1.17060&quot;&gt;autocratic&lt;/a&gt;” leadership, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/computer-modelling-brain-in-a-box-1.10066&quot;&gt;crap&lt;/a&gt;” ideas, and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/computer-modelling-brain-in-a-box-1.10066&quot;&gt;ill-conceived&lt;/a&gt;, ... idiosyncratic approach to brain simulation” in countless articles. His &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/computer-modelling-brain-in-a-box-1.10066&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ambition&lt;/a&gt; is undeniable, however:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“I realized I could be doing this [&lt;i&gt;eg., standard research on &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/275/5297/213&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spike-timing-dependent plasticity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;] for the next 25, 30 years of my  career, and it was still not going to help me understand &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;how the brain  works&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm certainly not a brilliant neuroscientist in Markram's league, but I commented  previously on &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2020/12/how-brain-works.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;how a quest&lt;/a&gt; to discover &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;“how  the brain works”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; might be futile:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;...the search for  the Holy Grail of [&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/a-neural-data-science-how-and-why-d7e3969086f2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The Spike&quot;&gt;spike trains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2017.0623&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Generative models for network neuroscience&quot;&gt;network generative models&lt;/a&gt;, manipulated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438820301471&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;according to NIH BRAIN&quot;&gt;neural circuit function&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_seung_i_am_my_connectome&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;'I Am My Connectome'- Sebastian Seung's TED talk&quot;&gt;My Own Private Connectome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nn0199_79&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;classic Rao &amp;amp; Ballard (1999)&quot;&gt;predictive coding&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aliusresearch.org/uploads/9/1/6/0/91600416/friston_-_of_woodlice_and_men.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Friston of course&quot;&gt;free energy principle&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), or a computer simulation of the human brain  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/henry_markram_a_brain_in_a_supercomputer?language=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Henry Markram's TED talk&quot;&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; by the Blue Brain Project] that will “explain” how “The Brain” works is  a quixotic quest. It's a misguided effort when the goal is framed so  simplistically (or monolithically).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In his infamous 2009 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/henry_markram_a_brain_in_a_supercomputer?language=en&quot;&gt;TED talk&lt;/a&gt;, Markram stated that a computer simulation of the human brain was possible in 10 years:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“I hope that you are at least partly convinced that it is not impossible to build a brain. We can do it within 10 years, and if we do succeed, we will send to TED, in 10 years, a hologram to talk to you.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This claim would come back to haunt him in 2019, because (of course) he was nowhere close to simulating a human brain. In his defense, Markram said that his critics &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6057/748&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;misunderstood&lt;/a&gt; and misinterpreted his grandiose proclamations.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800180;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blue Brain is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/bluebrain/&quot;&gt;aimed at&lt;/a&gt; “biologically detailed digital reconstructions and simulations of the mouse brain.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Silico&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documentary filmmaker &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noahhutton.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Noah Hutton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800180;&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;undertook his own 10 year project that followed Markram and colleagues as they worked towards the goals of Blue Brain. He was motivated by &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;that&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; TED talk and its enthralling prediction of a brain in a supercomputer (hence &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;). Originally entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bluebrain-documentary-premiere/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bluebrain&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and focused on Markram, the documentary evolved over time to include more realistic viewpoints and interviews with skeptical scientists, including Anne Churchland, Terry Sejnowski, Stanislas Dehaene, and Cori Bargmann. Ironically, Sebastian Seung was one of the loudest critics (ironic because Seung has a grandiose TED talk of his own, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_seung_i_am_my_connectome&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I Am My Connectome&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insilicofilm.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In Silico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; was available for streaming during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docnyc.net/film/in-silico/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DOC NYC&lt;/a&gt; Festival in November (in the US only), and I had the opportunity to watch it. I was impressed by the motivation and dedication required to complete such a lengthy project.  Hutton had gathered so much footage that he could have made multiple movies from different perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the film, Blue Brain/Human Brain blew up, with ample critiques and a signed petition from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/07/updated-european-neuroscientists-revolt-against-eus-human-brain-project&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hundreds&lt;/a&gt; of neuroscientists (see archived &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20140710070144/http://www.neurofuture.eu:80/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open Letter&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And  Hutton grew up. He reflects on the process (and how he changed) at the end of film. He was only 22 at the start, and 10 years is a long time at any age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the Big Questions in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insilicofilm.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In Silico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you make sure all this lovely simulated activity would be relevant for an animal's behavior?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you build in biological imperfections (noise) or introduce chaos into your perfect pristine computational model? “Tiny mistakes” are critical for adaptable biological systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;“You cannot play the same soccer game again,” said one of the critics (Terry Sejnowski, I think)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;“What is a generic brain?”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the vision? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timeline kept drifting further and further into the future. It was 10 years in 2009, 10 years in 2012, 10 years in 2013, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geneva 2019, and it's Year 10 &lt;span class=&quot;aCOpRe&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; only two Principals left, 150 papers published, and a model of 10 million neurons in mouse cortex. Stunning visuals, but still disconnected from behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, “What have we learned about the brain? Not much. The model is incomprehensible,” to paraphrase Sejnowski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;GABA Interneurons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another brilliant and charismatic neuroscientist, &lt;a href=&quot;https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/about/team/staff-profiles/christof-koch/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Christof Koch&lt;/a&gt;, was interviewed by Hutton. “Henry has two personalities. One is a  fantastic, sober scientist … the other is a PR-minded messiah.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koch is Chief Scientist of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/news-press/press-releases/allen-institute-announces-new-phase-neuroscience-research&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MindScope Program&lt;/a&gt; at the  Allen Institute for Brain Science, which focuses on how neural circuits produce vision. Another major unit is the Cell Types Program, which (as advertised) focuses on brain cell types and connectivity.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800180;&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Allen Institute &lt;a href=&quot;https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;core principles&lt;/a&gt; are team science, Big Science, and open science. An impressive recent paper by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S009286742031254X&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gouwens and 97 colleagues (2020&lt;/a&gt;) is a prime example of all three. Meticulous analyses of structural, physiological, and genetic properties identified 28 “met-types” of GABAergic interneurons that have congruent &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;m&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;orphological, &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;lectrophysiological, and &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;t&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;ranscriptomic properties. This was winnowed down from more than 500 morphologies in 4,200 GABA-containing interneurons in mouse visual cortex. With this mind-boggling level of neuronal complexity in one specific class of cells in mouse cortex — along with the impossibility of “mind uploading” — my inclination is to say that we will &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;never&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqlvSDEhxoA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Romeo Void&quot;&gt;never say never&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; be able to build a realistic computer simulation of the human brain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JHd5XsNXIHg/YBPngNhheaI/AAAAAAAANQg/FvRwoMugSzMJWfbd1gAHj2XWR8nq4W34ACLcBGAsYHQ/s996/multi-modal%2Bdata%2Bcollection%2Bfrom%2BGABAergic%2Binterneurons.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;996&quot; data-original-width=&quot;996&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JHd5XsNXIHg/YBPngNhheaI/AAAAAAAANQg/FvRwoMugSzMJWfbd1gAHj2XWR8nq4W34ACLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h400/multi-modal%2Bdata%2Bcollection%2Bfrom%2BGABAergic%2Binterneurons.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S009286742031254X&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gouwens et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800180;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Here's another gem: “There literally are only a handful of equations that you need to simulate the activity of the neocortex.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800180;&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Most of Hutton's work has been as writer and director of documentary  films, but I was excited to see that his first narrative feature, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lapsisfilm.com/&quot;&gt;Lapsis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,  will be available for streaming next month. To accompany his film, he's  created an immersive online world of interlinked websites that  advertise non-existent employment opportunities, entertainment ventures,  diseases, and treatments. It very much reminds me of the realistic yet  spoof websites associated with the films &lt;i&gt;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20050205164041/http://www.lacunainc.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LACUNA, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Ex Machina&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20160305001055/http://bluebook.is/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BlueBook&lt;/a&gt;).

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the start of a new year it’s customary to look forward, imagining what we might want to achieve in the months to come. It’s what lies at the heart of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/13/how-to-achieve-your-new-years-resolutions-according-to-psychology/&quot;&gt;New Year’s resolutions&lt;/a&gt;: they may be maligned for their persistent failure to stick, but do at least represent a great degree of hope for the future — a hope to become fitter or more productive, or to learn something new. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the current circumstances hope is certainly in short supply. But if you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; manage to stay hopeful you might be able to avoid risk-taking behaviours like drinking, taking drugs, gambling or overeating, argues a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-020-09989-4&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Gambling Studies&lt;/em&gt; from Shahriar Keshavarz and team at the University of East Anglia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study focuses specifically on “relative deprivation” — the belief that your lot in life is somehow worse than other people’s. Previous research has suggested that those who score highly on feelings of relative deprivation are more likely to engage in “maladaptive escape behaviours” including risk-taking. But hope could ameliorate such behaviour, the team argues, protecting people from potential harm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41249&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 51 participants started by filling in two measures. One looked at hope, with participants indicating how much they agreed with statements related to goal-directed energy (“I energetically pursue my goals”) and alternate routes to success (“I can think of many ways to get out of a jam”). The second looked at relative deprivation — how deprived or privileged participants felt compared to other people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, the participants took part in a risk-taking task. They saw an animated cannon, which could fire balls that land anywhere between 0 and 100 metres away, and were asked to bet on where they thought the ball would land. When selecting the distance, participants had three options: a high risk option, which let them cover a five metre range (e.g. the ball landing between 20 and 25 metres away), a medium risk option, which offered a ten metre range (e.g. 20 and 30 metres) and a low risk option (e.g. 20 to 40 metres). The higher the risk, the more money participants could win.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants who felt relatively deprived showed an inverse relationship between goal-directed energy and risk-taking. That is, among this group risk-taking was lower for those who had a greater sense of “hope” in the form of directing energy towards achieving their goals. (Those who felt relatively privileged showed the opposite pattern, with risk taking increasing among those with greater hope).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the second study, 50 participants again filled in measures related to hope and relative deprivation, before being shown their position on a (fake) “Comparative Discretionary Income” index, showing how deprived or privileged they were compared to others based on their income. Some participants were shown a score that indicated they were deprived, while others were told they were comparatively privileged. They then completed the risk-taking measure from the first experiment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that inducing people to feel deprived led them to take more risks — but again, those who reported more feelings of hope regarding their goals took less risks than those with low levels of hope.  This suggests hope for the future may act as a protective factor against risk-taking in those who feel relatively deprived. Relatively privileged participants again showed the opposite pattern, with hope increasing risk taking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The final study looked at 122 participants who had gambled at least once in the last year. Participants completed the hope and relative deprivation scales, as well as an index measuring how severe their gambling was on a scale from one (no problem) to four (problem gambling). Results from this measure suggested that 27% of participants had no gambling problems, 26% had low levels of problems, 38% had moderate problems and 9% were problem gamblers with possible loss of control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As in the previous studies, among participants who reported being relatively deprived, those who showed more goal-directed energy were less likely to have problems with gambling. There was no relationship between hope and gambling severity amongst those who felt relatively privileged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hope may therefore be a vital tool for those experiencing difficulties in their life, buffering against risky or potentially harmful behaviours like gambling, drinking or drug-taking. The team posits that those who feel relatively deprived engage in risky behaviours in order to allay or sublimate negative feeling; understanding the importance of hope in such a situation may be a good start in developing behavioural interventions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It can be difficult to feel satisfied with what you’ve got, especially if those around you appear to be thriving financially, socially or romantically. Looking for ways out of your situation, energetically pursuing goals and thinking of new solutions to problems may not solve all of your problems — but it could make the temptations of risk-taking easier to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-020-09989-4&quot;&gt;Relative Deprivation and Hope: Predictors of Risk Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="fr-FR">
 &lt;p&gt;What is science? It is somewhat frustrating for a scientist to not be able to answer this question precisely. Yet it is a very important question, in particular in the public debate. For example, how are we to convince people to listen to science if we cannot explain what is special about science? What makes science better than the opinion of any given person or institution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this has been a central question in philosophy of science. For a while, it was thought that science is characterized by a particular method, a set of rules that one can follow to produce new truths about the world. This is impossible, because for any finite set of observations, there is an infinite number of general propositions that agree with those observations. Then came Karl Popper: he proposed that a scientific proposition is a proposition that can in principle be falsified, that is, such that there exists a statement that would logically contradict it (whether it is actually true or not). For example, “all penguins are black” can be contradicted by the statement “this is a blue penguin”. Popper’s motivation was to distinguish between science and pseudo-science or religious discourse. For example, it is not possible to contradict the existence of God because any fact can be interpreted as what God wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although still very popular today, in particular among biologists, falsifiability has been heavily criticized. There are several fatal shortcomings in this idea. A simple one is that it tends to classify pseudo-sciences as sciences, for a simple reason: they can be falsified because they actually have been falsified. So the criterion is not sufficient. Other arguments show that it is not necessary (or meaningful) either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other analyses have shown that methods used by scientists are rather flexible both historically and, more importantly, across disciplines. Physicists do not use double-blind tests with control groups. Paleontologists do not produce empirical knowledge by experimentation. So if there is a scientific method, then which one is it? It is not that there is no scientific method. Rather, scientific methods are objects of scientific activity (things that scientists develop, use and discuss) rather than definitions of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Hoyningen-Huene proposes a new theory of the nature of science, called systematicity theory, which brings some interesting ideas to this question. It is published in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199985050.001.0001/acprof-9780199985050&quot;&gt;recent book&lt;/a&gt;, and formerly &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11406-007-9100-x&quot;&gt;in a short article&lt;/a&gt;. First, the original angle is that instead of comparing science with pseudo-science, he compares science with everyday knowledge. With this perspective, it becomes clear that there is something special about not just natural sciences, but essentially all academic fields including human sciences. History, for example, is distinctly more scientific than anecdotes that you could tell at dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thesis is that what characterizes science is that is more &lt;em&gt;systematic&lt;/em&gt; than non-science (on a similar subject). This idea of systematicity is developed in several dimensions. It must be noted that his goal is descriptive, nor normative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, scientific descriptions tend to be systematic, e.g. with taxonomy, axiomatization, periodization (for history). Take the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6118/452&quot;&gt;discovery of actin rings in the axon&lt;/a&gt; of neurons thanks to super-resolution microscopy. This is purely descriptive. Is it not science because it is not a test of a theory, maybe on the epistemic level of a news article? No, it is clearly science: it is part of an effort to systematically describe what a cell is made of. Writing the state of the art in a thesis, for example, is an exercise to systematically cover everything relevant about a particular subject, and it is an important skill that a scientist must acquire. Not crediting and referencing a relevant study is considered a professional error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A particularly important dimension of systematicity is the defense of knowledge claims, that is, the way scientific claims are backed up. In mathematics, for example, there is the formal proof, a systematic way of demonstrating the validity of a claim. In other sciences, one may try to systematically consider and rule out alternative interpretations. All sciences develop field-specific methods to avoid errors. It is not that there is a method that is guaranteed to produce truths. Rather, there is an effort in each discipline to systematically develop ways of tracking errors. This includes social practices, such as peer review. In peer review, the author must systematically address all contradictions raised by a reviewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book addresses many other aspects. It is not a particularly entertaining book, in fact I suspect that the author has made a particular effort to be systematic in his treatment of the subject. But the thesis is interesting because it covers many distinctive aspects of science that are usually not reported when discussing the nature of science. It also gives a more satisfying account of how science differs from pseudo-science. Pseudo-science is typically selective rather than systematic: claims are supported by a careful selection of evidence; objections are dismissed rather than systematically rebutted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the thesis is not meant to be normative, I think it provides an interesting perspective on several aspects of modern science that are currently discussed, and which are also relevant to the politics of science. I will briefly discuss two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is the spread of scientific story-telling. In so-called “high-profile” journals, in particular in biology, there is considerable pressure to present a “good story”, something that is coherent, appealing, entertaining. And as publishing in those journals basically determines whether you can remain a working scientist, this is considerable pressure on all scientists. A scientist must also be a good communicator, story-telling advocates say. Obviously, it is better to have a well-written paper than a poorly written paper. Yes, but everything else being equal. Here unfortunately making a good story means selecting and ordering results so as to construct a coherent narrative, while dismissing every observation, remark, or previous study, which weakens or confuses the narrative. This clearly goes against systematicity. What then distinguishes such scientific “stories” from pseudo-scientific claims misleadingly backed up by carefully selected facts? It seems clear that systematically acknowledging all facts and interpretations that are not in line with the thesis of the authors, or simply that require specific explanations, is critically important in a scientific study. Yes, it might make the paper less entertaining and exciting. But that should not be the primary goal: the primary goal a scientific paper is a systematic report on a study. Developing scientific writing skills does not necessarily mean making up stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another and related aspect is the idea, in particular in the research funding system, that good science must be disruptive, paradigm-shifting - only innovative ideas must be funded. Yes, because it is better to do ground-breaking science than ground-scratching science. This is the key principle of the ERC, for example. But again, this is not what science is about. This might be what product development is about (not even sure about that). But science is about systematically consolidating, expanding and connecting existing pieces of knowledge. Occasionally extraordinary discoveries are made, or new fields emerge. But that is nowhere near the core of science, which relies on systematic, rigorous examination. Without this, what we are left with is a bunch of TED talks - entertaining, occasionally informing, but you cannot learn to build rockets by watching TED talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not think that systematicity theory exhausts the question, however. What seems missing, in particular, is that science is about telling truths about the world. Science is a systematic activity, but not any activity: it is an activity whose goal is to document truths about the world. This means that being a scientist is not just following some practices, but also making an ethical commitment: a commitment to an ideal of truth. This is in my view a critical point when discussing the politics of science - how science should be organized, evaluated, communicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it certainly does not exhaust the subject, what is satisfying about Hoyningen-Huene’s book is that, while it is lucid enough to acknowledge that there is no universal scientific method, it still convincingly argues that there is something special about science, something that may be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/disease-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementation Science is a growing field that seeks to accelerate the science into real world practice, an event that can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3241518/&quot;&gt;often times take 17 years to achieve.&lt;/a&gt; While we are exploring the factors that affect the translation of science, we also need to understand why ineffective practices continue to persist and why effective practices are ended. This is what the study of mis-implementation seeks to answer. In particular, in the United States, it is estimated that only &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18287919/&quot;&gt;60% of public health practices are actually evidence based&lt;/a&gt;. That leaves the question about what is happening with the other 40% of practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our research published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, our team conducted a national survey of state health department chronic disease employees to gather more information on how often they felt mis-implementation was occurring in their departments and what could be the possible factors that affect these types of decisions. As the United States has witnessed in the past year, State Health departments are significant drivers of public health interventions. Chronic Diseases are considered a considerable risk factor for cancer and it is estimated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/fundingprofiles/&quot;&gt;$1.1 billion is annually expended to state cancer control and chronic disease prevention programs&lt;/a&gt;. But despite this large number, a small amount of that is actually used towards primary prevention programs such as physical activity and nutritional intervention programs. Given the scarce resources available, it is crucial to know that every dollar is being used towards the most effective and wide-reaching programs. And unfortunately, that may not always be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;50.7% of state health department chronic disease employees reported that their work unit sometimes, often or always ended effective programs that should have continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our national survey, we found that 50.7% of state health department chronic disease employees reported that their work unit sometimes, often or always ended effective programs that should have continued. Not surprisingly, the overwhelming reason being funding priorities changed or ended. State Health Department funding is based heavily on time limited grants and it’s not always guaranteed that a successful program will continue to see its funding continue. This is consistent with the literature around evidence-based decision making that &lt;a href=&quot;https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13012-018-0717-x&quot;&gt;engaging with policymakers around programming funding can enhance the sustainment of evidence based programs.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side of the mis-implementation coin, 48.5% of state health department employees stated that sometimes, often or always continued programs that should have ended. While funding was still a prominent factor with inappropriately continued programs, policymakers and agency leadership were also significant factors in this decision making outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leadership qualities around perseverance of program implementation and managing change can also have an effect on program continuation outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked further about factors that affect these outcomes, participants revealed that organizational &amp;amp; agency factors have a significant influence. Most significant is that too many organizational layers in a state health agency can impede decision-making. Also leadership qualities around perseverance of program implementation and managing change can also have an effect on program continuation outcomes. Organizational capacity can be a major influence in the success of a programs outcomes. It is simply not enough to have an effective public health program. We also need public health agencies that have the organizational capacity to deliver them effectively and understand when programs should not be continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study team is continuing to build on this initial data by conducting qualitative case studies to highlight the mis-implementation challenges and success that state agencies have been met with in implementing these programs. The team has also partnered with a group at the Brookings Institute to create agent-based models that can help further describe and highlight how these decision-making processes play out in state agencies. These models can eventually be a tool for facilitating better decision-making in the eventual hope that it helps decrease the prevalence of mis-implementation in state health department chronic disease programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still much to learn about mis-implementation and how implementation science can improve our public health systems. Our study is one of the firsts to really identify these factors across state public health agencies in the United States. We hope that lessons learned from this study can eventually contributed to improved chronic disease health outcomes locally, nationally and globally.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Two boats are sinking and you can save only one. One holds two dogs, the other a person. Which do you save? If you’re not sure, you can say, ‘I can’t decide.’” When I put this to my 11-year-old, his response was immediate: “Save the dogs!” In his defence, he has grown up with a pet dog, which he adores — and, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620960398&quot;&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, most other kids would say the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To adults, these findings might seem a little alarming. Indeed, when the team put similar questions (varying the numbers of dogs, pigs and people) to adult participants, 61% opted to save one human over 100 dogs (which does mean of course that nearly 40% didn’t), and 85% of people prioritised one human over one dog, while 93% opted to save a human rather than a single pig (3% went for the pig).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the team asked 249 kids aged between five and nine about what they thought, though, they found that just over 70% opted to let a person die to save 100 dogs. When it came to one human vs one dog, only about a third of the children opted to save the person, 28% were clear on going for the dog, and the rest couldn’t decide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41239&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When pigs, rather than dogs, were pitted against people, the children’s responses were also revealing. Of course, pigs are not generally kept as pets, but for many of these urban, US-based kids (whose religion, if any, was not ascertained), are rather sources of food. And yet only 57% prioritised one human over one pig, and 18% reported that they’d save the pig. The child’s age had no impact — the 9-year-olds made the same judgements as the 5-year-olds. However, both kids and adults who had regular exposure to dogs showed less of bias in favour of people over dogs; for the kids, this also extended to a lower bias in favour of people over pigs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up study of fresh groups of adult and child participants, the team kept the same varying human vs dog or pig ratios but altered the question to ask what “Mr X”, who “always does the right thing” would do. They did this to be very clear that they were asking for moral judgements. The results were very similar to those from the first study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, the team had also asked the adults and kids to rate humans’, dogs’ and pigs’ intelligence and also capacity to feel pain, sadness and fear. Both adults and kids gave similar ratings for all three species, and agreed that people scored higher on these counts than dogs, who scored higher than pigs. “Yet despite this,” the team notes, “children and adults gave different moral judgements, which suggests that perceived intelligence and sentience does not fully account for moral judgements.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So why do adults have a much stronger pro-human bias? The team suspect that this is something that is learned relatively late in childhood. “Adolescents may learn and internalise the socially held speciesist notion — or ideology — that humans are morally special and deserve full moral status, whereas animals do not,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They do note, however, that their groups of US-based, primarily white, English-speaking participants from mostly urban areas is not exactly globally representative. It would be interesting, of course, to explore whether kids who grow up on farms, say, have different ideas about the relative importance of particular animals vs humans. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given my son’s (not unexpected) reaction to the dog vs people questions, the findings on kids are a little reassuring: he’s not unusual in feeling that way. I’m fairly sure, though, that if I’d got more personal, and asked him to choose between saving his younger brother or Dottie, our dog, he’d have gone for his brother, if only for my sake… I can tell him that he’s less “speciesist” than me, at least.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620960398&quot;&gt;Children Prioritize Humans Over Animals Less Than Adults Do&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knitting thick yarn is exponentially quicker than thin yarn, so I am already approaching done. Gunhild is knitted, steek-ed, and has edgings – just a soak, then blocking (persuading the knit fabric to reach its final intended shape).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was one major setback on the way – I ran out of the main colour yarn after adding some much needed bust space. And so, it turns out, had every yarn store on the continent. That particular burnt orange nuance was backlisted months in 50 different yarn stores. I should in retrospect of course have gotten an extra ball of yarn of each color; I only got an extra ball of the gray contrast yarn. So this Gunhild is unique, with contrast coloured half sleeves, and slightly different edging.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/01/26/us-politicians-use-moral-language-more-often-when-they-have-less-power/"/>

		<updated>2021-01-26T12:51:04+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whatever your political affiliation, making appeals to people’s morality can be a powerful rhetorical tool. Politicians frequently use language that refers to moral principles of harm, fairness, loyalty, authority and purity, in order to defend policy positions, appeal to new voters and appease old ones. And it’s an approach that seems to work. Research suggests that people are far more likely to take action once they connect a particular issue with their own moral or ethical convictions — even to the point of &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00254.x&quot;&gt;committing acts of violence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But how and when politicians use moral language shifts with changes in the political landscape, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620960397&quot;&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Toronto’s Sze-Yuh Nina Wang and Yoel Inbar, published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;. Looking at Democrat and Republican politicians in the US, they found that moral language increased as political power &lt;em&gt;decreased, &lt;/em&gt;suggesting that its use is not fixed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41228&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first study looked at public tweets posted by members of the Senate and the House of Representatives; some, like Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, had millions of followers, while others had thousands. Using a text-analysis technique, the team coded nearly 700,000 tweets posted between January 2016 and January 2018 from 578 politicians in Congress (385,206 from Democrats and 302,154 from Republicans).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team focused on five moral foundations — harm, fairness, loyalty, authority and purity — and their positive and negative aspects (“virtues” and “vices”). For the analysis, the tweets were compared to a dictionary containing words related to each virtue and vice, to see how close the language in each tweet was to these words. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, Democrats used moral language more frequently than Republicans. And while moral language was used more by both parties after the 2016 Presidential election, this increase was greater for Democrats, who were more likely to go on using moral language. This was also the case for those moral foundations more traditionally associated with Republicans (loyalty, authority and purity).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second study looked at transcripts of all debates and proceedings in Congress between 1981 and 2017, utilising the same text-analysis technique as in the first study. In both the House and the Senate, the minority party was far more likely to use moral language related to almost all of the foundations (a notable exception was language related to authority, which was sometimes used more frequently by the majority party).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results suggest that the use of moral language is dynamic rather than static, and likely to change over time depending on context. This makes sense — moral language is often ramped up during national crises, perhaps because there is more at stake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future research could look at what subjects are being discussed using moral language — is it being used on specific issues, or more broadly to condemn the opposing party? &lt;em&gt;Who&lt;/em&gt; is using such language also seems relevant. There are a huge range of divergent views even within a political party itself — a left wing politician like Bernie Sanders or Ilhan Omar is unlikely to share the exact moral values of the more centrist Nancy Pelosi, for example, even though they all belong to the Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620960397&quot;&gt;Moral-Language Use by U.S. Political Elites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In December 2020, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/B-9-2020-0427_EN.html&quot;&gt;EU warned that the human rights situation in Egypt had deteriorated sharply&lt;/a&gt; over the last year, citing the arbitrary detainment of 4,000 citizens, imprisonment of 60,000 people on political grounds, the systematic enforced disappearance of political opponents, grave violations to the right to  life, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this climate, could we expect new mass protests to mark the ten-year anniversary of the Arab Spring? Based on interviews with participants and non-participants in the 2011 Egyptian and Moroccan uprisings, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://t.co/Sd3yRjdUoi?amp=1&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; investigates the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.dornschneider.net/data.php&quot;&gt;cognitive processes&lt;/a&gt; underlying the protests. The findings show that individuals joined the uprisings based on hot, positive emotions, which translated into protest decision with great speed. In contrast, decisions to stay at home were based on slow and cool reasoning processes focused on individual safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety considerations were so strong that they encouraged large numbers of people to abstain from the Arab Spring even if individuals approved of the protests and rejected the ruling regime. In the words of a non-participant: “&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.dornschneider.net/files/cogs.12762.pdf&quot;&gt;When people are killed, we must be careful. There are more important things than protest: safety and stability&lt;/a&gt;.” On the other hand, positive emotions of courage to face the government, hope that protest would succeed, solidarity with other protestors, and national pride were major contributors to the Arab Spring. These emotions were themselves triggered by the successful mass uprisings in Tunisia, unprecedented numbers of protest at home, and fellow citizens sacrificing their lives to face violent state authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current situation does not display these emotional triggers, but countless grounds for safety concerns. Nevertheless, hot cognition and emotion-based reasoning &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374533557&quot;&gt;happen fast&lt;/a&gt;, and researchers have observed that mass protests take off very suddenly, so that they “&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~public.econ.duke.edu/~tk43/abstracts/articles/ab_article_18A.htm&quot;&gt;will unavoidably continue to catch the world by surprise&lt;/a&gt;.” When Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire, nobody would have anticipated the subsequent Arab Spring. Similar triggers will occur in the Arab world, with the potential of translating into new uprisings. In the words of a Moroccan participant of the Arab Spring: “I am convinced that totalitarianism will disappear.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the US National Basketball Association (NBA) was forced to pause the season due to Covid-19 on March 11 last year, the fans were naturally devastated. When the season resumed five months later, with the top 22 teams bubbled together and playing every game in Orlando, Florida, this was great news for the sport, and the fans — and a pair of US researchers. Andrew McHill at Oregon Health and Science University and Evan Chinoy at Leidos Inc, in San Diego, realised that the restart provided a perfect natural experiment to explore the effects of travel on play. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78901-2&quot;&gt;Their study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;, reveals some insights into causes of the well-documented sporting home-side advantage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41223&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “home-court” advantage, as it’s known in basketball, is apparent in the results tables: teams win more often at home than away. In normal circumstances, it’s hard, though, to disentangle all the possible variables that might underlie it. These include home-crowd noise, the discomfort of air travel, and time zone changes. In regular seasons, NBA teams do regularly travel long distances across the US, through one, two or even three time zones, to play away games. Many NBA players report resulting sleep loss and fatigue, and harmful effects on their performance, recovery and mood, the researchers note. Disruption to circadian rhythms has been considered the mostly likely culprit, though the rigours of travel and sleeping away from home have also been highlighted as potentially play a role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To explore just how travel affects play, the researchers looked at the results of the 22 teams’ games before the pause, compared with their results while none were travelling and all were playing in one location, in Orlando. The pair also considered various aspects of the teams’ performances in each game.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first portion of the season, teams won 63.8% of their home games, and 50.8 % of their away games. McHill and Chinoy found, though, that there was only a disadvantage to playing away when a team had to travel across time zones, and not when they played away within the same time zone (the detrimental effects of travelling across time zones mostly occurred when teams travelled westwards, rather than eastward). When the teams were later all playing in Florida, with no travel (and only virtual fans), though a “home” and “away” team was designated for each game, there was no “home” advantage. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers then looked more closely at various aspects of play. They found that when teams travelled across time zones, their shooting accuracy suffered. They also lost more possessions and scored fewer points per 100 possessions (indicating that they were playing more defensively). But even when a team played away and didn’t cross time zones, they played a more defensive game, and they got a lower percentage of the offensive rebounds (an event that gives the offensive team another opportunity to score).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;McHill and Chinoy also found that when the teams did not travel, while bubbled, the typical home-court advantages for shooting accuracy and rebounding were reduced. “Thus, home-court advantage in professional basketball appears to be linked with the away team’s impaired shooting accuracy and rebounding,” the pair writes. They add that these “may be separately influenced by either circadian disruption or the general effect of travel, as these differences manifest differently when teams travel within or across multiple time zones.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Athletes in other major sports, including baseball, also travel regularly across time zones. If basketball shooting accuracy is taken as a measure of movement precision, and this is worsened by such travel, this could help to explain the home-side advantage — or the away-side disadvantage — in these sports, too. As the researchers also note: “Future work is needed to explore other athletic events where travel schedules can impact performance to further elucidate travel and circadian factors.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78901-2&quot;&gt;Utilizing the National Basketball Association’s COVID-19 restart “bubble” to uncover the impact of travel and circadian disruption on athletic performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humans process and recognise faces as a whole, rather than by examining individual features&lt;/strong&gt;. Now new work suggests that some species of wasp also process faces in this “holistic” fashion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/01/humans-wasps-seem-recognize-faces-more-sum-their-parts&quot;&gt;reports Cathleen O’Grady&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science Magazine&lt;/em&gt;. Golden paper wasps were better at recognising other wasps when shown pictures of the whole face rather than just part of it, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41206&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When we lie to someone, we may end up mimicking their body language. &lt;/strong&gt;That’s according to a study in which participants cheated while solving a puzzle, and then either told the truth or lied about their cheating to another participant. When the participant lied, pairs’ movements were more similar than when the participant told the truth, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2264607-lying-makes-us-mimic-the-body-language-of-the-people-we-are-talking-to/&quot;&gt;reports Christa Lesté-Lasserre&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the past year, have you found yourself endlessly scrolling through social media as the world falls apart? &lt;/strong&gt;If so, you’re not alone — “doomscrolling” seems to be pretty common. At &lt;em&gt;Cosmic Shambles&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmicshambles.com/words/blogs/deanburnett/doomscrolling&quot;&gt;Dean Burnett explains&lt;/a&gt; just why this seemingly stressful activity is so appealing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-invasive brain stimulation might help to alleviate symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/electrical-brain-stimulation-may-alleviate-obsessive-compulsive-behaviors/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciam%2Fmind-and-brain+%28Topic%3A+Mind+%26+Brain%29&quot;&gt;reports Diana Kwon&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers found that transcranial alternating current stimulation delivered over the brain’s orbitofrontal cortex reduced compulsive behaviours in people who had OCD symptoms. But it remains to be seen whether similar results are found in people with a formal OCD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The COVID-19 vaccine is being rolled out across the country — but can we also inoculate people against misinformation about the virus? &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/covid-19-misinformation-scientists-create-a-psychological-vaccine-to-protect-against-fake-news-153024&quot;&gt;Sander van der Linden and Jon Roozenbeek explain their approach&lt;/a&gt; to proactively protecting people from fake news.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teenagers “catch” moods from their peers — and this is particularly the case for bad moods, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jan/20/teenagers-can-catch-moods-from-friends-study-finds&quot;&gt;reports Sally Weale&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. To figure out how moods were transmitted within teens’ social networks, researchers asked young musicians to keep diaries of their mood and social interactions during concert tours. The team also found the participants’ popularity wasn’t related to their mood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The storming of the US Capitol earlier this month marked the low point of a troubling few months in American politics. &lt;/strong&gt;But what can psychology tell us about the factors involved in this kind of “mass mobilisation” — and how can we make sure it doesn’t happen again? &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/01/what-psychology-of-mass-mobilization-can-tell-us-about-the-capitol-riot/&quot;&gt;Jennifer Ouellette takes a look&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compiled by Matthew Warren (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@MattbWarren&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), Editor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/&quot;&gt;BPS Research Digest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please join us for two virtual NIH BRAIN Initiative meetings on Tuesday, January 26, 2021 and Wednesday, January 27, 2021. Videocast will be available for the BRAIN Neuroethics Working Group meeting and for the open session of the BRAIN Multi-Council Working Group meeting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-2983&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neuroethics Working Group meeting – Tuesday, January 26, 2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics-working-group&quot;&gt;Neuroethics Working Group (NEWG)&lt;/a&gt; will hold its eleventh meeting. Input from members of the NEWG helps to ensure that neuroethics is fully integrated into the BRAIN Initiative. The meeting will feature a presentation on emerging ethics themes within BRAIN by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bioethics.nih.gov/people/hendriks-bio.shtml&quot;&gt;Dr. Saskia Hendriks&lt;/a&gt; from the NIH Department of Bioethics. Then, the group will discuss plans for potential neuroethics workshops on several topics, including neural data privacy, ensuring inclusivity, and others. Lastly, in the context of existing themes within the BRAIN portfolio and potential emerging neuroethics topics of interest, the NEWG will revisit themes outlined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/strategic-planning/acd-working-groups/brain-initiative%C2%AE-and-neuroethics-enabling-and-enhancing&quot;&gt;BRAIN 2.0 neuroethics report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting will take place from &lt;strong&gt;12:00 PM – 3:20 PM (ET)&lt;/strong&gt; and anyone can tune in live via &lt;a href=&quot;https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=40155&quot;&gt;videocast&lt;/a&gt;. For more details, please view the &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics-working-group&quot;&gt;NEWG webpage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Council Working Group meeting – &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wednesday, January 27, 2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/about/multi-council-working-group&quot;&gt;Multi-Council Working Group (MCWG)&lt;/a&gt; will convene its eighteenth meeting to discuss the current state of BRAIN and the Initiative’s future. The meeting will feature updates from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/About-NINDS/Who-We-Are/staff/John-Ngai&quot;&gt;Dr. John Ngai&lt;/a&gt;, NIH BRAIN Initiative Director, and a presentation on training, inclusion, and equity (TIE) efforts by Drs.

		<link href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/XZpljA2M98A/"/>
		<id>https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18626</id>
		<updated>2021-01-21T16:58:24+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced an agreement for BTAA members to participate in PLOS’ Community Action Publishing (CAP) program. The agreement ensures time to test and evaluate this new community-based model and allows BTAA researchers to publish in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt; without incurring fees. The BTAA and PLOS will also collaborate on future data, metrics, and tools for institutions to evaluate Open Access publishing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The BTAA is the largest consortium globally to participate in both CAP communities, meaning that every member has committed to the full three-year pilot. As some of the largest research institutions in the world and major contributors to both journals, the BTAA commitment ensures this new collective action-based model kicks off with a strong foundation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Big Ten Academic Alliance members are: Indiana University, Michigan State University, Northwestern University, Ohio State University, Pennsylvania State University, Purdue University, Rutgers University–New Brunswick, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, University of Iowa, University of Maryland–College Park, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, University of Nebraska–Lincoln, University of Wisconsin–Madison, and the University of Chicago. PLOS has extended the benefits of this agreement to include most system, regional, and branch campuses of these universities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Big Ten Academic Alliance’s commitment to this community-driven model demonstrates the power of collectives to transform scholarly publishing. This collaboration has been a partnership from the beginning and BTAA’s members and administration have been vital in helping us build and execute on this new experiment in sustainable highly selective publishing.” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maurice York, BTAA’s Director of Library Initiatives, adds: “One of the key strategic questions in front of us is how to advance the growth of open science and open scholarship through collective and intentional action. We are actively seeking pathways to create a sustainable, scalable open knowledge ecosystem for our researchers and scholars. We are pleased to join together with PLOS to take up this pilot in common cause.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS’ Community Action Publishing (CAP) is PLOS’ effort to sustain highly selective journal publishing without Article Processing Charges for authors. More details about the model can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/publish/publishing-faqs/#plos-community-action-publishing&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The BTAA publishing deal continues the momentum for PLOS in 2020, following other agreements with the University of California system, Jisc (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester) and the Canadian Research Knowledge Network &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/&quot;&gt;among others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;Episode 23 of PsychCrunch&lt;/strong&gt;, the podcast from the British Psychological Society’s &lt;em&gt;Research Digest&lt;/em&gt;. Download &lt;a href=&quot;https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/psychcrunch/PsychCrunch_Ep23.mp3&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;audio class=&quot;wp-audio-shortcode&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; id=&quot;audio-41184-1&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/psychcrunch/PsychCrunch_Ep23.mp3?_=1&quot; type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/psychcrunch/PsychCrunch_Ep23.mp3&quot;&gt;https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/psychcrunch/PsychCrunch_Ep23.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this episode, Emily Reynolds, staff writer at &lt;em&gt;Research Digest&lt;/em&gt;, explores modern psychology’s relationship with race and representation. It’s well-known that psychology has a generalisability problem, with studies overwhelmingly using so-called “WEIRD” participants: those who are Western and educated and from industrialised, rich and democratic societies. But how does that shape the assumptions we make about participants of different racial identities or cultures? And how can top-tier psychology journals improve diversity among not only participants but also authors and editors?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our guests, in order of appearance, are &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=BKCHEON&amp;amp;CategoryDescription=psychology&quot;&gt;Dr Bobby Cheon&lt;/a&gt;, Assistant Professor at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ccsre.stanford.edu/people/steven-o-roberts&quot;&gt;Dr Steven O. Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, Assistant Professor of Psychology at Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Personality traits were once thought to be fairly stable. But recent research has suggested that our personality can alter over time — whether that’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/30/heres-how-our-personality-changes-as-we-age/&quot;&gt;due to ageing&lt;/a&gt; or because we &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/01/merely-desiring-to-alter-your-personality-is-not-enough-and-may-backfire-unless-you-take-concrete-action-to-change/&quot;&gt;decide to change our traits ourselves&lt;/a&gt;. And as personality is &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/04/here-are-the-personality-traits-most-strongly-associated-with-being-environmentally-conscious/&quot;&gt;linked to our behaviour&lt;/a&gt;, it follows that we might see different life outcomes as our personality shifts or grows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620957998&quot;&gt;new study in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Kevin A. Hoff and team look at the personality changes of teenagers as they move into adulthood. And they find that certain shifts in personality can result in real-world benefits during the early years of a career, suggesting that interventions that increase particular traits and skills could make all the difference at work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41171&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team examined data from two longitudinal samples of young people from Iceland, who were followed over twelve years from their late teens to early adulthood; at several time-points, participants had rated their Big Five personality traits. The team also examined standardised test scores from the teenagers’ final year in education and noted the highest degree each participant had attained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also rated participants’ “occupational prestige” once in the workforce — how high or low status their work was seen to be in general society. Participants also shared how much money they earned, and indicated how satisfied they were with what they had achieved in their career thus far and in their current job. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As expected, the personality traits of the teens changed as they entered young adulthood. The largest increases were seen in agreeableness, openness and conscientiousness, while extraversion decreased. Personality traits at adolescence were stronger predictors of participants’ academic achievement than personality &lt;em&gt;changes&lt;/em&gt;: those who were more conscientious, emotionally stable, and agreeable were more likely to attain a higher degree. Emotional stability and conscientiousness at school-age were also the strongest predictors of occupational prestige.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those personality changes, however, were also important. Participants who became more emotionally stable and those who became more extraverted were more likely to receive a higher income, while increases in emotional stability, extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness were the strongest predictors of career and job satisfaction across the samples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We already know that we can change our personality and increase how outgoing, agreeable, or open we are. And given the results of the study, it also seems possible that targeted interventions to help young people develop the skills associated with particular personalities could help them achieve certain goals. The fact that personality growth was the strongest predictor of the subjective measures of career and job satisfaction also indicates that growth is an important part of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; young people think about their success.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though this study focused on work success, other areas of life could also be explored in future research. For some people, relationships, social skills or self-image are more important than their careers, and understanding how personality change can impact these dimensions would also be interesting. Certain personality traits are also likely to be more valued or useful in certain lines of work, so further exploration of this might also help teenagers work out which elements of their personality they would like to develop depending on their goals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Helping teenagers understand that their personality is not fixed, the team concludes, is one of the most important takeaways from the study: while our personalities clearly play a part in our lives, we’re by no means fated to stay the same forever.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Good negotiators are more likely to secure a pay rise, get the house or job they want, and keep the peace at home. No end of psychological studies have explored which attitudes, behaviours, and settings will help a negotiation go your way. Here, we take a look at some of the key findings:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41166&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the best way to prepare for a negotiation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plenty of studies have found that people in positions of low power tend to do worse in a negotiation than people with high power. A job interviewer or someone with a desirable house to sell falls into the high-power category. So if you’re about to walk into an interview, or start negotiating over a house or car, say, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167215577365&quot;&gt;it would help if you first engaged in a little self-affirmation&lt;/a&gt;, according to a study on MBA students. Before going into a meeting in which they were acting as the would-be buyer of a biotech plant, some of the participants spent five minutes writing about their most important negotiating skill. In the subsequent negotiation, for this group, the typical high-power advantage of the “seller” was significantly reduced, and they secured lower sale prices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than going into a negotiation with the view that a gain for one side is a loss for the other (a so-called “win-lose mindset”), it’s worth remembering that, depending on the terms of the deal, it could be win-win. That’s according to the authors of a study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Psychology&lt;/em&gt; in 2019. The team found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/apl0000427&quot;&gt;people in a position of financial vulnerability were more likely to hold the win-lose mindset&lt;/a&gt; by default, and less likely to capitalise on any opportunities for both sides to gain. “By holding this win-lose mindset, financially disadvantaged people may continue to make poor deals, perpetuating their situation,” says Marko Pitesa at the Singapore Management University, who was involved in the research. But being aware of this mentality might help to stop it happening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I kick off a negotiation in the right way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A work-related negotiation doesn’t have to happen in the office, of course. In fact, a far better location would be a restaurant that serves food on sharing platters… This, at least, was the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619830633&quot;&gt;shared plates, shared minds&lt;/a&gt;” finding of a study published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; in 2019. Pairs of participants who’d shared a single bowl of crisps and salsa went on to require, on average, nine rounds of negotiation to resolve a theoretical wage dispute, four rounds fewer than pairs who’d eaten the same snack from their own bowls. The shared eating promoted cooperation, the team thinks. “Basically, every meal that you’re eating alone is a missed opportunity to connect to someone,” says co-author Ayelet Fishbach at the University of Chicago. “And every meal that involves food sharing fully utilizes the opportunity to create that social bond.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A small alcoholic drink &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/06/17/a-small-alcoholic-drink-could-benefit-business-negotiations-study-finds/&quot;&gt;could be a helpful addition to the meal, too&lt;/a&gt;. When both participants in a bargaining game had one 350ml glass of beer, they became more collaborative, compared with those who’d drunk juice. “In settings in which skepticism can lead to a breakdown in negotiation, alcohol consumption can make people drop their guard for each other’s actions, thus facilitating reaching an agreement,” the team explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will anger help me get what I want? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/05/11/why-you-should-add-a-bit-of-grrrrr-to-your-negotiations/&quot;&gt;you should add a bit of grrr to your negotiations&lt;/a&gt; has a long history. While some studies have found that it isn’t a good idea, others have suggested that pretending you are angry can be helpful, especially if the person you are negotiating with is in a pretty weak position. However, the effect of anger &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2010/07/09/effect-of-anger-on-negotiations-depends-on-cultural-context/&quot;&gt;does depend on the cultural context&lt;/a&gt;: a 2010 study found that while it could help in a negotiation with someone from a European background, it backfired in negotiations with someone from an East Asian background, where traditionally such behaviour is regarded as inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the effect of getting angry on the negotiation will also depend at least partly on what you &lt;em&gt;expec&lt;/em&gt;t it to be. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-29279-001&quot;&gt;2017 study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt; found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/10/20/the-effect-of-emotions-on-your-behaviour-depends-partly-on-your-expectations/&quot;&gt;participants in a negotiation task who’d been led to believe that anger would be helpful and who felt more angry during the task did make more money&lt;/a&gt;. But for those who had not been guided in this way, whether they felt angry or not made no difference to how much money they made. As the team wrote: “At least in some cases, what we expect emotions to do may determine what they actually do.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is face-to-face negotiation always best?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, that depends… If you have Dark Triad tendencies — if you’d score highly for narcissism, psychopathy or Machiavellianism — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886915300738?via=ihub&quot;&gt;then yes, you’d be much better off negotiating in person&lt;/a&gt;, according to a study of 200 Canadian students. The team asked the participants to negotiate for concert tickets, as a buyer or seller, either face-to-face or via text on a computer. Those who ranked higher on the Dark Triad spectrum did better in face-to-face negotiations than negotiations via the computer, whereas those who’d ranked low in these traits did better online compared to in-person. In fact, when negotiating via computer, those who’d placed higher on the Dark Triad spectrum were significantly less successful than the others. Whatever the ability of such people to charm, manipulate or intimidate others in person, they lose this edge when negotiating online, the team concludes. This also implies, of course, that if you think your boss might have Dark Triad tendencies, it could be better to conduct a negotiation over a pay rise by email rather than face-to-face.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to negotiations via text, there are a few other things to consider. For instance, a negotiating pair is more likely to reach mutually agreeable terms in an online discussion &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/01/07/physical-distance-boosts-the-success-of-computer-based-negotiation/&quot;&gt;when they think of each other as being physically distant, rather than physically close&lt;/a&gt;. In this study, two people did the negotiating. But what if you used an Artificial Intelligence agent to do your negotiating — a task that AI agents, or bots, are tipped to take over? This does affect our negotiation strategies, according to a recent study in the US. Among other things, the team found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/27/were-more-willing-to-use-deceitful-tactics-when-a-bot-does-the-negotiating/&quot;&gt;less experienced negotiators are more likely to be deceitful if they assign an AI agent to do their dirty work for them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about negotiating at home?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you don’t like a job offer, or a bid for your house, you don’t have to take it. But if you’re in a relationship, and want to stay in it, you will have to find ways to negotiate your way through all kinds of disagreements, from the minor — such as plans for the weekend — to the major (whether to take a job in another country, say.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In all these situations, it would be worth bearing in mind the results of a recent analysis of data on more than 32,000 people from nine different countries: &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/25/how-making-sacrifices-for-a-partner-or-saying-you-will-affects-wellbeing/&quot;&gt; if you feel that you would in theory be willing to make a sacrifice for your partner, there are benefits for you both&lt;/a&gt;. However, when one person actually makes a sacrifice (not just &lt;em&gt;says&lt;/em&gt; that they would), it’s a different story. The data suggests that in these situations, the person actually making a sacrifice tends to feel the burden of it. Gaining a major concession from your partner could clearly, then, end up being a case not merely of win-lose, but lose-lose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what if you’ve just agreed to make a significant sacrifice for your partner, or you’re weighing one up? The researchers have some advice: “Being willing to sacrifice may be valuable for individuals and couples but when people actually perform this behaviour, they maximise their wellbeing when they focus on the gains rather than the losses.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;You know the way Google search will sometimes finish your sentences for you? Or, when you’re typing an email, there’s some ghostly predictive text that floats just in front of your cursor? Well, there’s a new kid on the block that makes these gadgets look like toy tricks out of a Christmas cracker. Give it a sentence of Jane Austen and it will finish the paragraph in the same style. Give it a philosophical conjecture and it will fill the page with near-coherent academic ruminations. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-020-09548-1&quot;&gt;GPT-3&lt;/a&gt; is essentially just predicting what words should come next, following on from the prompt it’s been given. That the machine does so well is partly because it’s been trained on an unimaginably huge database of samples of English (reputedly, $13 million worth of training). A similar machine can predict, from a sequence of amino acids, how the resulting protein will fold, short-cutting months of lab work and in some cases years of human ingenuity (&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology&quot;&gt;AlphaFold&lt;/a&gt;). But what is going on inside the machine? What is it keeping track of inside its huge neural network “brain”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We face the same question, of course, when we look at the human brain—a seemingly inscrutable organ of even greater complexity. Yet neuroscience is beginning to make sense of what’s going on inside: of patterns of activity distributed across millions of neurons, flowing into other patterns; coupling and modulating; unfolding in a way that opens the organism to the world outside, projected through its inner space of needs and drives, bathed in the wash of past experience, reaching out to control and modify that world to its own agenda. We can now see what some of these patterns of activity are, and we have an inkling of what they are doing, of how they track the environment, and subserve behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists are recording these patterns with new techniques. But what do the patterns mean? How should they be understood? Neuroscience is increasingly tackling these questions by asking what the activation patterns &lt;em&gt;represent&lt;/em&gt;. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627308009434&quot;&gt;“representational similarity analysis”&lt;/a&gt; (RSA) is used to ask whether the human brain processes images in the same way as the brain of the macaque monkey. Surprisingly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8619.short&quot;&gt;similar techniques&lt;/a&gt; can be used to compare the human brain to an AI computer system trained to perform the same task. These AIs are deep neural networks, cousins of the seemingly unfathomable GPT-3 and AlphaFold brains we met at the start. Astoundingly, it turns out that sometimes the deep neural network is processing images in roughly the same way as the human brain. In a general sense, both are performing the same computations en route to working out that they are looking at a picture of two cats on a sofa. In other cases, we see the brain using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~papers.nips.cc/paper/9104-better-transfer-learning-with-inferred-successor-maps&quot;&gt;hexagonal code&lt;/a&gt; to represent physical space—and more abstract conceptual spaces—and to reason about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this means that representation has become something of a hot topic in cognitive neuroscience. Representation has always been around, of course, working away in the foundations ever since the “cognitive revolution” showed that we could explain behaviour in terms of internal processing without having to feel embarrassed about intelligent homunculi or ghosts in the machine. What we have now are much better ways to see those representations in the brain and to marry them up with the computational story about how the organism intelligently deals with its environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“representation is the crucial link for connecting brain activity with functional, adaptive behaviour”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we still need is a proper understanding of what representation is—an understanding of how there come to be things in the head which stand in for, and allow creatures to deal with, things in their environment. A once-unconventional idea in contemporary philosophy (originating with Ruth Millikan, David Papineau, and Karen Neander) is that this is intimately tied up with function—biological functions based on natural selection. Although a connection to function may have always been implicit in some scientific practice, it is now being recognised explicitly (&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3017&quot;&gt;Hunt et al. 2012&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0520-2&quot;&gt;Richards et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;). For example, in a recent manifesto for the role of representation in computational cognitive neuroscience, Kriegeskorte and Diedrichsen (&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-neuro-080317-061906&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;) argue that representation is the crucial link for connecting brain activity with functional, adaptive behaviour. Meanwhile in philosophy, appealing to natural teleology to explain representation has moved into the mainstream, being embraced by researchers from diverse disciplinary starting points (&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10539-014-9432-4&quot;&gt;David Haig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-metaphysics-of-representation-9780198850205&quot;&gt;Robert Williams&lt;/a&gt;), alongside recent landmark contributions from early advocates (&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/mark-mental&quot;&gt;Karen Neander&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/beyond-concepts-9780198717195&quot;&gt;Ruth Millikan&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The devil is in the details, of course, but it is beginning to look as if we have the main ingredients in place: internal states that stand in useful relations to things in the environment, internal processing which relies on those relations, and the functions that serves for the organism. Just as the cognitive sciences come to lean on representation ever more heavily, it seems that we now have the resources to understand this foundational notion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feature image by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://stock.adobe.com/images/brain-data-ai-technology-robotic-molecule-of-chemical-atom-cell-science-hacker-online-cyber-network-system-of-background-illustration-3d-rendering-futuristic-cloud-storage-deep-learning/271835259&quot;&gt;issaronow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/01/what-is-representation-in-the-human-brain-and-ai-systems/&quot;&gt;What is “representation” in the human brain and AI systems?&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/641921470/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/641921470/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/01/safety-first-considering-protest-reasoning-10-years-on-from-the-arab-spring/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Safety first?

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, CA and OTTAWA, ON — The Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN) and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced an agreement for CRKN members to participate in PLOS’ Community Action Publishing (CAP) program, a new collective action publishing model from PLOS, enabling 19 participating CRKN institutions to publish fee-free in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; PLOS&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Biology. &lt;/em&gt;This model shifts publishing costs from authors to research institutions based on prior publishing history as affiliated with corresponding and contributing authors. The group collectively contributes to the shared cost recovery target and any surplus revenue collected by PLOS is redistributed to members.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are delighted to welcome PLOS’ very first Canadian partners to our Community Action Publishing program. Despite a very difficult budget landscape, Canadian institutions’ commitment to community-driven Open Access experimentation remains as strong as ever,” said Sara Rouhi, director of strategic partnerships for PLOS. “As ever, we’re excited to partner with institutions sharing our mission to further equitable and barrier free open reading and publishing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CRKN members’ participation in this innovative publishing initiative from PLOS highlights Canada’s dedication to furthering open access,” commented Clare Appavoo, Executive Director of CRKN. “Bold ideas drive our community forward, and it is inspiring to see publishers like PLOS advancing new business models for open scholarship. We look forward to collaborating with PLOS as the model and program develop.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CRKN participating members include: Brock University, McMaster University, Mount Allison University, Mount Saint Vincent University, Ontario Tech University, Queen’s University, Simon Fraser University, Université Laval, University of Alberta, University of Guelph, University of Manitoba, University of New Brunswick, University of Ottawa, University of Saskatchewan, University of Toronto, University of Waterloo, Western University, Wilfrid Laurier University, and York University.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the Community Action Publishing agreement, which began on January 1, 2021, authors from participating CRKN institutions will have unlimited publishing in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; through a collective action model. Both corresponding and contributing authors affiliated with participating CRKN institutions are eligible, and new institutions are permitted to join the agreement at any time during this initial three-year period. The model itself is predicated on cost recovery, capped margins, and redistributing revenues above target back to community members.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CRKN, which represents 81 academic and research institutions across Canada, joins the University of California and Jisc (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester) among others in signing open access publishing agreements with PLOS in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We all know that using a smartphone interferes with our ability to focus on other things — like driving. But in 2017, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/691462&quot;&gt;surprising result&lt;/a&gt; made international headlines: the mere presence of a switched off smartphone on the desk can impair working memory. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810020301975?via=ihub&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Consciousness and Cognition&lt;/em&gt;, which has partially replicated and extended this investigation, has &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; found evidence to support the “brain drain” effect. However, the researchers, led by Matthias Hartmann at University of Bern, Switzerland, say that we shouldn’t start putting our phones back on our desks just yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41158&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 2017 study was led by Adrian Ward at the University of Texas, Austin. His team found that people who’d been instructed to put their phones in another room performed significantly better on tests designed to measure their cognitive capacity than those who had their phones on the desk. They also did slightly better than participants who’d put their phone in a pocket or bag. It didn’t matter whether their phones were off or on or face up or down; just having the phone easily accessible meant that people had to resist the impulse to use it, which used some of their available cognitive capacity, the team concluded. This meant they had less to spare on the tasks, which drew on working memory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hartmann and his colleagues decided to investigate possible impacts on two other types of memory: short term memory and also prospective memory — remembering to do something in the future. They recruited 302 participants with a mean age of about 22, and asked all to put their phones into flight mode. Half were told that they could leave their phone on their desk, while the other half had their phones taken by the experimenter and placed on the opposite side of the room, so that, they were told, they would not be distracted by them. (Since it’s normal to ask study participants not to use their phones, the team didn’t expect this to alert them to the nature of the study.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The participants were then presented with a series of pictures of easily identifiable objects paired with unrelated words. They were told to read each word aloud and to memorise the pictures. Every so often, they were asked to say out loud as many of the pictures as they could remember from the previous block, and an experimenter wrote these down. This was the test of their short-term memory. Before embarking on a second series of word-picture presentations, they were told to inform the experimenter whenever they saw a word that belonged in the category of “musical instruments”. This tested their prospective memory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that whether participants’ phones were in clear view or on the other side of the room made no overall difference to performance on these memory tasks. The participants had also completed questionnaires measuring their impulsiveness and their levels of smartphone dependence, and, when the team took a closer look at this data, a link — albeit an unexpected one — did pop out. Those people who ranked low for smartphone dependence did poorer on the prospective memory test when their phone was in view.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What should we make of all this? Given the 2017 findings, “the lack of an effect of smartphone presence on short-term memory performance was surprising,” the team writes. There were some methodological differences between the two studies, they note. Further work to more perfectly replicate the initial study is now needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for the prospective memory findings, “our results seem to suggest that the benefit of smartphone absence disappears for people with higher levels of smartphone dependency,” the team writes, “as if the negative effects of missing one’s own smartphone when it is absent counteracts the positive effect of smartphone absence.” However, given the limited data so far, it’s too early to draw any firm conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers stress that there is strong evidence from a range of earlier studies that “personally relevant” stimuli — like our phones — can impair our performance on cognitive tasks. “Our results should therefore not motivate people to put their smartphones on their desks at work,” they conclude. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810020301975&quot;&gt;Does a smartphone on the desk drain our brain? No evidence of cognitive costs due to smartphone presence in a short-term and prospective memory task&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-12242 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/COVID-19-300x180.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ladds et. al&lt;/em&gt; describes “long Covid” as fluctuating symptoms such as coughing, breathlessness, fever, sore throat, chest pain, palpitations, cognitive deficits, myalgia, neurological symptoms, skin rashes, and diarrhoea beyond 3-4 weeks after infection. Despite the great advances in COVID-19 research, there is minimal knowledge about managing “long Covid”. This is emphasized by the participant’s instrumental role in the recruitment and development of this study. This online qualitative study reports the experiences of 114 participants from the UK weeks after their acute illness to better understand COVID-19. These focus groups reveal that those who experience “long Covid” endure difficulty accessing health services despite their uncertain prognosis and occasionally severe reoccurring symptoms. This study informs a basis to improve services while highlighting the importance of patient support groups to better navigate this ambiguous illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As cannabis consumption increases worldwide, it is crucial to investigate the effects of prenatal and maternal cannabis use on birth outcomes. &lt;em&gt;Michalski et al&lt;/em&gt;. observe that pre-pregnancy cannabis users experience 2.0 times the odds of birthing an infant with low birth weight, small size for gestational age, or preterm birth. Here, 216 women self-reported cannabis use in their pre/early pregnancy period while disclosing low rates of concurrent substance use such as alcohol and tobacco. While many studies aim to investigate this trend among pregnant women, this Ontario-based study confirms the specific impacts of cannabis use on infant health. Although there is more research to complete in regards to other modes of cannabis consumption, this study emphasizes the need for clinical messaging to expecting mothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12243&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/Pesticides-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boedeker et. al&lt;/em&gt; performed a systematic review examining the prevalence of a widely overlooked national and international public health issue called unintentional, acute pesticide poisoning. This study identified that farm workers and farmers account for 385 million cases of unintentional acute pesticide poisoning cases and around 11,000 deaths per year due to occupational exposure. Boedecker and team conclude this only accounts for a fraction of annual poisonings as registers and hospitals may underreport non-fatal events. Unfortunately, unintentional acute pesticide poisoning can lead to chronic outcomes such as a decreased quality of life or even the inability to continue working arguing the imperative of enhancing the accuracy of national databases and improving access to medical care and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the availability of mental health care for migrant populations who continue to experience high levels of mental health issues. By conducting semi-structured interviews with 10 psychotherapists across Germany whom have experience in dealing with refugee’s mental health problems, the authors were able to identify three main challenges in this cross-cultural practice. These include, differing or unrealistic expectations of clients towards what psychotherapy may offer, challenges integrated in illness explanatory models and communication challenges. Aside from identifying the main challenges with cross-cultural psychotherapy the authors showed that psychotherapy with refugees can be extremely successful but identifies challenges that underline the importance of designing and introducing new structural approaches to training psychotherapists for the introduction of psychotherapy at scale. As the incidence of mental health problems among refugee populations continues to increase, the ability to provide appropriate mental health support to these vulnerable individuals becomes ever more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Governments and health systems, dealing with end-of-life issues presents a major challenge. Despite progress in the introduction of relevant legislature, many barriers still exist to its proper implementation. By conducting 37 in-depth interviews with professionals and decision makers associated with the health care system in Israel the authors were able to identify 6 major barriers to coping with end-of-life issues. These include, Law procedures, Clinical aspects, Human aspects, Knowledge/skill, Communication and finally Resource allocation. They find that ubiquitously the relationship between the patient and their clinical care teams is important. With medical teams often in daily contact with the patient they inherit significant responsibility in implementation of end-of-life care. The authors conclude that by improving or championing accessibility to homes able to provide appropriate care for end-of-life needs, increased public and health system awareness, and support in understanding end-of-life laws, health systems and governments can aim to ensure the best care for end-of-life patients.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h4&gt;To spike or not to spike?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*f-PUy8OtUgBjR9CStS5Jzw.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is well known that a neuron is the main cell of the nervous system. It generates electrical pulses as large as 0.1Volts, has sprouts — axons (as long as 1 meter) and dendrites (several millimeters), and lives more than 100 years. You will not find another more marvelous cell in the body. Still, I will not write about biological details (despite how interesting they are). Rather, I will try to define the most important computational principles, which might help with the progression to artificial intelligence (AI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convergence towards principles always leads to simplification and generalization, but it can be dangerous. The brain is too diverse. You can simplify too much and lose something important. Let’s dare to try. Ultimately, it is an iterative process. We merely want to become less wrong with time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle 1. Neurons are binary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neuron generates and transmits electrical pulses (also called spikes). They are very similar in amplitude and duration, so they can be treated as binary events (spike=1, no spike=0). Yet, we don’t fully understand how exactly thousands and millions of neurons represent knowledge, perform basic calculations, and store casual relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some neurons transmit information by the frequency of spikes. For example, the more a motor-neuron activates in the spinal cord, the stronger the muscle contracts. For a long time, people thought that other neurons in the cerebral cortex send information in a similar way. After the famous Hubel and Wiesel experiments, we know that a neuron in a visual area has a higher spike frequency for a particular stimulus. If the cat sees the vertical line, a particular neuron activates very fast, but if we rotate the line — the neuron slows down. This can be summarized in a tuning curve:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/325/1*fpzzvLZv1y6FskcgHK0FCA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many decades, the idea of frequency coding was dominant. Even now, artificial neural networks use the same coding (real numbers). But a nasty problem ruins the frequency view: to “measure” the rate of firing you need to wait for a long time (hundreds of milliseconds) to average spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the brain computes much faster. Humans need around 100 ms to recognize an object. Information travels from the retina to the thalamus, then is projected to the visual cortex, where it hops across three or four areas before reaching the IT area. Here the recognition of an object occurs. Taking into account the time for spike generation (2–5 ms) and spike propagation (roughly 10–20ms), there is just enough time to send 1–2 pulses… and no way to wait longer to “send” the frequency of firing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, individual spikes (0 or 1) somehow should be enough to transmit information. Currently, the prevailing idea is that an individual neuron does not send a lot, but many of them can encode anything (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_coding#Population_coding&quot;&gt;population coding&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, my friend asked me: “How does the brain encode information? Perhaps with something super complex?”. “No”, I said. “Most likely, it uses a binary code similar to computers, but the principles are very different.” Neural coding is one of the most compelling areas of research with many mysteries and open problems. Intriguingly, it relates nicely to information theory. It is not just about data representation, but about something fundamental, about the organization of matter to reflect nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though we are still far from fully understanding the neural code. There are bursting neurons that emit many spikes very fast. Can we simplify the burst of pulses as one binary event? Neuromodulators change how the neuron is excited. Possibly, different brain regions (like sensory and motor) use different coding schemes. Yet, most likely the main tasks like recognition, memory, and planning use binary codes (that can be modulated in various ways).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle 2. Neurons integrate information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical neuron in neocortex has around 10 000 connections and more than 100 of them are active simultaneously. Information integration means that a neuron “hears” all 10 thousand “calls” and compresses them to 0 or 1 (spike or no spike). Mathematically, 10 thousand neurons can be active in 2¹⁰⁰⁰⁰ possible ways (0 or 1 for each input). We could enumerate and put all of them into a table (two columns, 2¹⁰⁰⁰⁰ rows) but even the whole universe could not store it. Alternatively, we can write the table in a compact form as some function (y=f(x)).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/733/1*YKHv4Y7JMOot_27ipsYtnA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the biggest advantage of a neuron is that it can change its inner parameters (like the weights &lt;strong&gt;w &lt;/strong&gt;in artificial neurons). Biologically, these parameters are realized as synapses between neurons, or as a distribution of ion channels on a membrane, or other molecules that determine the excitability of a cell. By changing the parameters, a neuron can change its function, its answers to 10 000 inputs. Parameters add new columns to this gigantic table and can be written as a parametric function y=f(x, w). The number of different functions the neuron can realize is called expressivity. The larger the expressivity, the more ways a neuron can integrate information. And it is crucial for learning, which is essentially a search for the right function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last 20 years, people showed that the expressivity of a biological neuron is much larger than previously thought. It turns out that the dendrites do not simply transmit the signal to the center of a cell but process it along the way. If a local dendritic branch gets activated too much, it can amplify the signal (an event called a dendritic spike).Thus, synapses that are active close in space and time excite the cell much larger than simultaneous but non-local signals. This is important: read it once more. Here is a helpful picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/892/1*T7fePm4EPGdF7FizBYzeaQ.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the left, three axons (in color) bring the activation from three neurons and spread their synapses randomly. On the right, synapses concentrate locally. The right neuron is excited more, and more likely generates an action potential (the figure shows three axons for simplicity, usually a neuron needs more to fire).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, not only the strength of a connection is important but its location. Because of this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00300/full&quot;&gt;people argued&lt;/a&gt; for a new learning paradigm: not only the weights but their locations also store information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The larger the dendritic tree, the more ways to arrange synapses, thus the more ways to activate the neuron and the larger the expressivity. Interestingly, evolutionary smarter animals have a larger dendritic tree. The picture below shows the pyramidal neurons of 1.Bat, 2.Rat, 3.Cat, 4. Dolphin (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elib.oa.edu.ua/items/show/1153&quot;&gt;source &lt;/a&gt;in Russian). Similarly, humans have more elaborate dendritic trees compared to chimpanzees (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/23/10/2429/295312&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). Maybe, with more powerful neurons animals get higher intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/380/1*kZMZ5wS_4_uVEPbB37y4Lw.png&quot; /&gt;Pyramidal neurons of 1.Bat, 2.Rat, 3.Cat, 4. Dolphin&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old models of a neuron (like ReLU or threshold) are called “point” models. They do not include dendrites and are computationally weaker. Such models people still use in artificial neural networks and do not want to adopt new, more complex neurons. One of the reasons is that it’s not clear how to learn a new model with active dendrites. Another reason is that by collecting together many simple neurons you can achieve the same expressivity as a single complex neuron. So, more or less, a two-layer network corresponds to a biological neuron. Read a really &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/your-cortex-contains-17-billion-computers-9034e42d34f2&quot;&gt;captivating article&lt;/a&gt; that explains it in depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, even this is an overly simplistic view — a real neuron is more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle 3. Neurons integrate information in time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spike or not to spike is the final result of all preceding computations. Still, it doesn’t simply discharge like a capacitor. The neuron remembers what happened before. Mathematically, a neuron is a complex dynamical system with time-varying parameters. Simple neuronal models can not describe all phenomena. For example, the same inputs at one time elicit activation and at another — don’t. A neuron remembers not simply a correct combination of neurons among 10 000 but &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;this combination occurs. As if the neuron looks over the window &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt; back in time and makes a decision (0 or 1) based on (2¹⁰⁰⁰⁰)^T possible scenarios. It opens the way for remembering sequences by a single neuron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such mechanism of integration across time is the control of neuronal excitability. Once a neuron becomes active from a stimulus “A” it can change its inner parameter (for example the concentration of the protein &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CREB&quot;&gt;CREB&lt;/a&gt;) to make itself more easily activated in the future. Even after many hours, this neuron will be activated from another stimulus “B” with a higher probability. One neuron gets activated for two stimuli and links them together. Since the memory is stored distributed across many neurons there will be an overlapping population of cells that stored a causal relationship “A-&amp;gt;B” . Changing neuronal excitability may be the way we form episodic memory (here is a nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069162.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190069162-e-7&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/444/1*mo81zqIUIPg3rqjSSVSqVg.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another mechanism is when a neuron stores sequential information in other neurons. Active neurons excite other cells and shape a particular network activity (called the “context”). After a certain time, the context may cause the activation of some other neuron. This neuron encodes the previous history (a sequence) that shaped that context. This is the domain of recurrent neural networks in which it is extremely hard to unravel the chain of computations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/290/1*2CRtXL1zUu2SJLG3pnV8YQ.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet another way how a neuron preserves memory is via its spines, the places where axons attach the dendrites. They also have inner parameters that can be changed to store information. One hypothesis (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_tagging&quot;&gt;synaptic tagging&lt;/a&gt;) proposes that spines “remember” the previous activation by expressing some tag. Later, the activation of a synapse interferes with the tag, which makes the connection stronger. That is why sometimes people argue for learning of different time scales (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06258&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Some parameters can change quickly in response to rapid events. And some change very slowly, reflecting things happening over minutes, hours and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lesson is — the neurons are very variable. They can change themselves (ion channels, spines, other proteins…) to record the spatial and temporal activation of the network overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle 4. Neurons learn … to survive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neuron is a living cell, and like any other it has needs. It consumes a lot of energy to fire electrical pulses. This energy must come from somewhere. Here neurons receive help from astrocytes, supportive glial cells, that live close to neurons, with around one astrocyte for three neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes sense when the neuron becomes active and change the permeability of blood capillaries to increase the flow of oxygen and glucose. These molecules are consumed by neuronal mitochondria that stores energy in the molecule ATP. Once, I had an Aha moment: “The goal of a neuron to become active to get nutrients. It activates and learns to survive!” Subsequently, I did not find any facts that support or reject this idea (that neuronal activity is the only way to get “food”). But the idea is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another similar and verified idea is homeostasis: a neuron sustains a target level of firing. If the activity exceeds or falls under the target level, the neuron launches the mechanics to return to this level. For example, a neuron can strengthen or weaken its connections (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_scaling&quot;&gt;synaptic scaling&lt;/a&gt;) or change its threshold for firing an action potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An interesting idea is that to be active just enough neurons change not only themselves, but try to change other neurons. They compete and cooperate with each other. A neuron tries to become active and prevent its neighbors from firing, a process called “winner takes all”. Or neurons try to “help” other distant neurons by activating them (hoping they will return the favour sometime). Of course, it is just a story where neurons, like warriors on a battlefield, survive, fight, create alliances. Nevertheless, it helps to link many experimental facts. Neurons indeed can activate local inhibitory cells that in turn decrease activation of other local neurons (“competition”). In addition, neurons in the visual cortex create distant connections with other neurons that encode similar stimuli (“cooperation”). Still, to confirm the story many experiments need to be done. And hopefully we will answer one of the most important questions in learning — how neurons choose with whom to connect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote that a neuron tracks the combinations among 10 000 connected neurons. Actually, it learns to recognize among 100,000 neurons. If two neurons are not connected but the axon of the first is close to the dendrite of a second, a connection may arise. It is structural plasticity — the creation and deletion of connections. A typical neuron in the neocortex has approximately 100,000 potential candidates to form the connection. What a possibility to reshape the network!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structural plasticity is prominent especially in children, who have a lot of excessive synapses. With aging (till around 30 years) the connections are pruned and the most valuable remain. The speed of this process varies in different brain regions: in some, like the parietal and frontal cortex, it takes longer to fully mature. But how to choose which connections to delete? One of the answers is the principle “use it or lose it”. Connections that are used rarely get eliminated. It is a highly selective procedure — one axon may climb to a particular neuron avoiding everyone else on its way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many theories of synaptic plasticity explain the changing of the strength of connections. Still, it is not completely clear how precise this strength might be. In artificial neural networks, the weight is a real number, for instance, 0.63737. True, neuronal spines vary in shape and size and a neuron can change the number and effectiveness of ion channels through which the positive ions pass and excite it ( ehh, I have to skip so many fascinating details). &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/10778&quot;&gt;Some estimates&lt;/a&gt; show that a synapse can store 4.7 bits of information, so it has 2^(4.7)=26 different states. Hence, learning is the change from one state to another. However, it is still debatable how long and how reliably the spine can remain in a given state. At least, we can treat the spine as one bit of information: are the two neurons connected? (And a couple more bits for the location of the synapse on a dendrite).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle 5. Neurons make errors and it’s okay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, synapses are very unreliable and stochastic. Often, neurons fail to transmit the signal, neurotransmitters may be “stuck” inside the axon. The successful transmission happens with some probability. That is why it is hard to reason about the strength of the connection. Interestingly, it may be not the weakness of evolution that could not invent reliable wires, but the discovery of how to make learning more efficient. Some theories suggest that stochastic connections may actually help. Neurons in some animals can change the probability of synaptic release as a way of learning (see a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2634&quot;&gt;good review&lt;/a&gt;). How common is this phenomenon in the human brain? How important is it computationally? We don’t know. New research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not just synapses, but neurons can be noisy as well. Sometimes they can even die. In some brain regions the death of neurons is very bad. Like in the brain stem where neurons control breathing, blood pressure, and sustain life. However, in most regions neurons might die and nothing terrible will happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the loss of some transistors could damage the whole chip and the computer stops working. Brain architecture is evolved to be stable to errors, to failure of neurons and synapses. Information is encoded in a large population of neurons, from multiple modalities (vision, hearing…). Thus, there is no grandmother neuron, the neuron that encodes only the grandmother. Otherwise, when that neuron dies — the memory is lost. One neuron does not encode only one stimulus but many. One memory is encoded in many neurons. If some cells make errors, no worries, the information remains. In case of massive cell death, like in a stroke, a function of the neurons might weaken, but later neuroplasticity reassigns the overload among other neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an important principle: if you build AI with brain-like neuronal networks, you must ask yourself “will my algorithm still work if I remove 10% of neurons? Or 20%?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surely, this was not a complete list of all principles. But these five are among the most important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, you will remember that a neuron is a living cell. It doesn’t care about information processing and computation, it just wants to survive.

 &lt;p&gt;Open Science is not a finish line, but rather a means to an end. An underlying goal behind the movement towards Open Science is to conduct and publish more reliable and thoroughly reported research. Increasing the transparency, reusability and connectivity of scientific outputs is a common desire shared among publishers and researchers, but progress can seem slow and implementation far from widespread. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Akin to how scientific understanding is often achieved through incremental progress, system-wide changes toward Open Science will only be achieved through earnest collaboration among funders, institutions, publishers and researchers. Looking at both pragmatic solutions and the underlying ideals, we imagine changes to scientific publishing in the context of four fundamental functions that publishers should provide: dissemination, verification, recognition and community building. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Dissemination&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can the future provide more usable, accessible and relevant dissemination? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The term “research article” is largely used as a catch-all for published discoveries. A research article is typically consumed as a static PDF that’s sent to publishers after results have been accrued and conclusions drawn. Readers must wait until the study is complete and the associated paper published before they can access the methodology, which may have been finalized months or years prior. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Breaking down the research article into more digestible and structured parts—or modules—can provide researchers with more opportunities to reuse and improve research. Incomplete reporting of methods in traditional articles can prevent research from being reused or reproduced. More opportunities to publish detailed and enhanced methods are the two article types coming soon to &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/protocols/&quot;&gt;Lab Protocols and Study Protocols&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lab Protocols, developed in partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://protocols.io&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt;, share the step-by-step instructions for verified methodologies and computational techniques. Utilizing the specialised features of protocols.io’s platform in conjunction with a peer-reviewed article on &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; that contextualizes the presented methodology, Lab Protocols will provide readers with the information needed to replicate a validated method in a precise and accessible format. Study Protocols are open for planned research studies, giving readers an opportunity to see design and analysis plans and helping reduce waste and bias in research. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the future, studies should be presented as a collection of interlinked research objects and associated metadata. Data, code, protocols, and other elements such as reagents can all be independently identified and verified, allowing for readers to more easily find and access the elements most relevant to them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Verification&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can widespread adoption of Open Science provide more reliable and reproducible research?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ultimate test for the reporting and validity of a study is whether it can be fully reproduced by different researchers. The materials used, the steps of the methods and the experimental conditions must be precisely described for a study to be reproducible. Reproduction of previous research can be a jumping-off point for contemporary researchers that leads to new discoveries. In short, proper reporting helps advance the field and accelerate further discoveries. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On platforms such as protocols.io, researchers can verify if published protocols work for them. Alongside participating researchers, publishers are important in the verification of publications by organising peer review, which can be customised for different research outputs. For Lab Protocols, &lt;em&gt;PLOS&lt;/em&gt; will be organizing peer review of submitted manuscripts and content hosted on protocols.io: a small step toward extending the value publishers can offer in verifying the validity of research and improving trust in new research formats. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Transparency enables verification. &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/&quot;&gt;Preregistration&lt;/a&gt; enables interrogation of what was planned and what was carried out, and publishing peer reviews and preprints allow readers to view changes that occur during peer review. Direct links to deposited data and executable code gives an opportunity to work with the same material as the original authors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having these elements—protocols, data, code, review history—available and linked to research articles reduces dependencies on the original authors of a study, promoting efficiency. A study that can be replicated with available and easy-to-find information allows the research to be usable far in the future. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Recognition&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can reward and incentive systems be improved to provide researchers with credit for more of their research? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The perceived success of a researcher has traditionally been dependent on the credit they receive through publications. Career advancement and other rewards can be determined by how research outputs are valued and recognized, and thus recognizing diverse and more granular research contributions beyond publications is essential for researchers to be rewarded for their work appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CRediT—required by all PLOS authors and publications—offers a more nuanced view of authorship and contributorship. By providing new opportunities for peer-reviewed publications that reward critical but sometimes overlooked contributions, such as a methods development, publishers can provide opportunities for diverse elements of the research process to be better recognized. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peer-reviewed protocols give authors a formal publication that enables their methods to be cited, shared and used as a signal of accomplishment. Similar opportunities exist for sharing, describing and citing research datasets and software, which need to be more widely adopted by the wider scientific community, furthering chances for additional recognition. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Publishers are just part of the solution. Institutions and funders can work with publishers to recognise and reward researchers for working transparently and reproducibly. Researchers can benefit personally from presenting their research in open, reusable formats as this can drive collaboration and reuse—and can consider Open Science principles when assessing studies by their peers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Community Building&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can Open Science provide more opportunities to collaborate and connect? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scientific community has made great progress in making Coronavirus research as Open as possible. With authors across disciplines depositing their articles as preprints and publishers making relevant research fully accessible, the benefits of Open Science have been made even clearer. By connecting researchers through peer review and providing structures to make relevant research shareable and accessible without barriers, journals help researchers build and maintain their communities. The role journals have in supporting these communities will continue to evolve as innovative new ways for researchers to collaborate and connect develop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If these sweeping changes have helped improve scientific discovery in a period of global need, they could be adopted in other areas of research. Comprehensive commitment to Open Science requires the full scientific community, as publishers alone cannot persuade such practices to be adopted. For research to be more efficiently disseminated, verified and credited, system-wide changes toward Open Access must be embraced across the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2021-01-12T14:30:24+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/09/iStock-653873888-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Background&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent publications have focused excessively on the mode of delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go beyond the sole question of the mode of delivery, an ontological approach was applied to understand the observation of perinatal morbidity. Indeed, unmeasured fetal and maternal factors can at least partly explain the breech delivery dilemma (planned cesarean section or trial of labor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What are the unresolved questions?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the weakness of a unique randomized trial, nor the imperfection of the older observational population based studies could clearly help explain the observed increase of perinatal morbidity with breech delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some authors argue that planned cesarean section may decrease perinatal morbidity. However, this argument does not take into account potential complications for subsequent pregnancies and the maternal choice to avoid a cesarean section, especially in favorable cases of breech vaginal delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, planned vaginal delivery could also be harmful and potentially unethical in unselected women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we identify a need for an individualized approach to the management of term breech presentation, as outlined in our recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-2831-4?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Debate paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12235&quot; style=&quot;width: 570px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12235&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/ff-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 1: The complex puzzle of breech presentation&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deterministic or accidental breech presentation? &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several recent population-based data studies reported that breech presentation was associated with prenatal factors that could also be related to maternal and/or perinatal morbidity and mortality. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fetal : fetal growth restriction, oligohydramnios, congenital fetal malformation, unknown breech presentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maternal : gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and a history of CS, congenital uterine malformation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings are in line with the greater risk of term antepartum stillbirth in breech presentation as compared to cephalic presentation (2-2.5‰ versus 0.5-1.5‰)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These points highlight the importance of screening for breech presentation of pregnancy at and beyond 36 weeks of pregnancy as well as estimating fetal weight (restriction or overgrowth) and well-being in cases of persistent breech presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Strict selection for favorable attempt breech delivery&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most national guidelines now (American, British, French, Australian and New-Zealand) propose comparable pre-established criteria for a careful selection of favorable cases for breech vaginal delivery, allowing an informed maternal choice. In contrast, without such strict selection, intrapartum cesarean section accounts for a greater proportion of maternal and perinatal morbidity and maternal morbidity than planned vaginal / cesarean delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, national guidelines and criteria for the management of term breech presentation should include: obstetric history, estimated fetal weight &amp;lt;3,800 g, non-hyper extended head on ultrasound, no evidence of antenatal fetal compromise and adequate mother pelvic size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the use of pelvimetry remains a matter of debate, recent studies confirmed findings of an older randomized trial suggesting that adequate pelvic size measurement may improve the selection of delivery route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence register studies support this view of a selection quality for candidate to vaginal breech delivery by the low conversion rate of vaginal to CS breech delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;How might we maximize patient benefit from a safe external cephalic version attempt?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current guidelines recommended external cephalic version (ECV) to limit the increase in elective CS rate for cases of term breech presentation. The true impact of ECV may first be limited by the timely detection of breech presentation and contraindications. Such screening should allow timely ECV at 36 weeks’ gestation and a careful evaluation of potential underlying antenatal risks, considering obstetric history, estimated fetal weight/growth and potential gestational disorders before ECV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, pregnancy with obstetrical factors (such as GDM) and fetal factors (such as footling breech or SGA), may particularly benefit from successful ECV at 36 weeks to avoid subsequent induction of labor with breech presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retrospective population based studies also highlighted that successful ECV for breech presentation are at increased risk for CS delivery, as compared with spontaneous cephalic presentation. Therefore, practitioners should understand that successful ECV is not the end of breech presentation management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Towards an individualized approach&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mode of delivery and breech presentation is only the tip of the iceberg (fig 2). It implies that planned cesarean section without understanding the underlying obstetrical condition cannot fully prevent increased perinatal morbidity associated with breech presentation. It also means that without strict selection, the higher perinatal morbidity after planned ECV and vaginal delivery suggested by some studies (as opposed to planned cesarean section) may become a .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 36 weeks of pregnancy, one must thoroughly consider obstetric history and fetal weight estimates based on clinical and ultrasound examinations, despite the large confidence interval of all available algorithms for producing such estimates, we advise that pelvic examination should be performed. Although radiologic or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pelvimetry is not universally recommended, its contribution provides very useful criteria to rule out pathological pelvic contraction for the preselection of planned modes of delivery and the counselling of women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, timely ECV should be proposed in light of the eligibility and possible benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience of the health care team/ availability of clinical skills is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, regardless of the planned mode of delivery, adequate follow-up during the last weeks of pregnancy is needed and subject to decision-making based on the continuous evaluation of risk factors, medical history, possible underlying disorders and comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a new project, by any means, rather one of my long-running favorite projects – the &lt;a href=&quot;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/&quot;&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt;. INCF has partcipated each year since 2011, and I have been the main org admin on ONCF’s behalf for all but the two first years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I described GSoC in some detail in Swedish back in 2014 when I guest-blogged at Tidningen Curie (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tidningencurie.se/gastbloggar/malinsandstrom/en-snart-passerad-sommar-av-kod/&quot;&gt;“En snart passerad sommar av kod”&lt;/a&gt;). Many of the things I named as positive then are still true today;  it is in many ways a &lt;em&gt;fantastically&lt;/em&gt; fun project to work with. The students are smart, motivated and enthusiastic over having the possibility to contribute to projects and tools that are needed and useful.  The mentors get a lot of development done for the price of regular mentoring, and the projects get new contributors – many continue to involve their students one way or another after the paid period, and some of them come back as mentors for the same project they started on. One former student, from 2018,  is even my co-org-admin! (Hi, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arnab1896.github.io/&quot;&gt;Arnab&lt;/a&gt;!) As mentoring organization, we get the joyous task of helping our community members help each other; many of the participating software tool projects are developed an maintained on small or no funds by the researchers themselves. We know how many small gaps there are that need to be bridged to make community tools better, faster, and smarter. And all the developed and inproved resources are openly accessible for everyone to pick up and continue working on or extend. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;January, now,  is the run up period – we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurostars.org/t/incf-call-for-community-project-proposals-and-mentors-for-gsoc-2021-deadline-for-expressions-of-interest-january-15/17865&quot;&gt;a call out for project suggestions and mentors&lt;/a&gt;, and responses have just started trickling in. Usually the mentors/project owners come to us with specific, well-thought-out and well described ideas, and sitting at the other end reading them all is a great experience – it is a veritable fountain of scientific and technical creativity, and one of the high points of my year. Projects that are well scoped and described – nearly all the submissions – end up on our official Project Ideas List and form the most important part of our application (I think, nobody knows exactly what Google looks for). As soon as that list goes public, around the end of January/start of February, mentors start interacting with potential students, working out the students’ project proposals. But slowly. The real explosion in activity comes when Google announces the year’s accepted organizations, this year that announcement goes out on March 9 (usually pretty late in the day, since it is on US-compatible time). It is always a very nervous day.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, Google has reshaped the program a bit, shortening the time spent coding and lowering the (high) threshold for participation. Which means we will get more students who are not hard core coders (yet) and need some support – which we as mentoring organization will be partly responsible for providing – and also the mentors and their community – all student projects start with an official community bonding period (genius idea). I distinctly remember being new to coding as a student, and hope that experience will help me be helpful. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;It seems I have a lot going on this coming year, I was a bit surprised myself when I started counting out my projects and landed at 9 long before I was done. Here is a status update:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/post/malinsandstrom.blog/1684&quot;&gt;2021 projects, #1: social media critique&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the book, digital now and paper on the way, but have not started yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/30/2021-projects-2-veganuary/&quot;&gt;2021 projects, #2: Veganuary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going well so far; veganizing breakfast was easy, quick work-from-home lunches depend mostly on what we ate the days before so they will veganize themselves in time. Dinner requires more adjustment, since I have two kids – relativley open to eating new things, but one of them is probably a supertaster. Most of my #veganuary updates will be posted on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/post/malinsandstrom.blog/1697&quot;&gt;2021 projects, #3: test-knit a cardigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also going well, I have the yoke almost done. The only annoyance is my cable keeps unscrewing from the right hand needle, regardless of how hard I screw it stuck. Again and again. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-4-learn-something-new/&quot;&gt;2021 projects, #4: learn something new&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This project hit an unanticipated rock in the road – the Swedish AI course I joined, “Elements of AI”  in Swedish translation, which looked good at the start, turned out to be a disappointment. Weirdly formulated  problem statements – I supposed they aimed to be inclusive give simple questions, but missed the mark – and finnicky automated-response-checkers. Translation was great, though. The only term not well translated was Data Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-5-community-managers-resilience/&quot;&gt;2021 projects, #5: community managers &amp;amp; resilience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Community managers at large have been a positive force for good, this year. In late January, there will be a Community Manager Appreciation Day, themed “resilience”. Expect some posts on that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-6-scouting-leadership/&quot;&gt;2021 projects, #6: scouting &amp;amp; leadership&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We joined in late November, so the only scout meetings we have had so far took place on Zoom. But there are plans to be outside and DO things, which I look much forward to. And I am psyched to be a parent-leader; I have &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many ideas for keeping the kids busy and entertained. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-7-books/&quot;&gt;2021 projects, #7: books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be the most work, likely. All books in the apartment need to get sorted, a fair amount will be packed in boxes, and the equal amount of books will come up from the cellar storage. All books to be scanned and registered. And I need to go through, sort and tag all my 700 e-books.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://malinsandstrom.blog/2021/01/01/2021-projects-8-podcasts/&quot;&gt;2021 projects, #8: podcasts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This project, I think, will be a main contributor to keeping me sane. I plan to take long walks and listen to interesting things. I have already found a few new favourites to add to my listening rota (which so far is mainly EscapePod): the ORIONScience podcast, and the Svenskan i Samhället (Swedish in Society) podcast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://malinsandstrom.blog/2021/01/04/2021-projects-9-rrids-on-everything/&quot;&gt;2021 projects, #9: RRIDs on everything&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far not my only upcoming work project. There will be Google Summer of Code, there will be INCF Working Groups, and literature search for the INCF Infrastructure Committee. And meeting new people, helping some people connect and collaborate… I will likely not have a boring moment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;This project is work-focused, but will surely frame my thinking and actions also beyond work. My latest work strategy meeting can pretty much be summed up in one sentence: RRIDs on &lt;em&gt;everythin&lt;/em&gt;g (and if it doesn’t have an RRID yet, get one for it).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RRID is short for Research Resource ID, and is a type of identifier to inambiguously identify, mention and cite a research resource, taken broadly. Web portals, software tools, antibodies, cell/animal lines or bacterial strains. RRIDs grew out of the Research Resource Identification Initiative, whose key members also are part of the INCF community in the US, ands was launched as a recommendation in 2014, re-emphasized by successful trial results published in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you have ever experienced an everyday name or identity collision – a similarly named classmate, a repeatedly mis-dialed phone number, getting emails meant for another person, having a neighbour or office colleague who gets your mail and you get theirs – you should already have a hunch about why identifiers are important, and what not having them means.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simply put, identifiers give us a way to be more specific and precise than mere words can offer. There are existing identifiers for research papers (DOI:s, since old, ~2000s), people (ORCID:s, even older, Oct 2012), and research institutions (ROR in 2019, GRID in 2015). And since even longer, books have identifiers. ISBN, the International Standard Book Number, was published in &lt;strong&gt;1970&lt;/strong&gt; as international standard ISO 2108. And identifiers typically are compact strings of characters, put together after a pattern, because you want them to be easy to use AND computer-readable .&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the existing set of identifiers did not cover all of research nearly enough: there were (and are still) problems with, for example: exactly and unambigously stating which antibod(ies) from which producer(s) you actually used. Or which breed of lab rat. Citing tools and specifying transparently which tools you use. Hence, RRIDs were conceived, and there is an ongoing campaign to get them broadly used.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Identifiers are useful on their own, but there are broader aspects – if you want to make science FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Internoperable, Reusable), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/dint_a_00025&quot;&gt;identifiers will be a part of your toolset&lt;/a&gt;. They also need to be machine readable, because computers deal with thousands of data points a lot better than most humans do, and it would be nice to be able to automate identification and information gathering. They need to be persistent, i.e stay the same and not start meaning something different regardless of how tech develops. They also need to be resolveable – there needs to be a service at the other end, likely a database – storing the associated info.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea is, if everything has an RRID, it doesn’t matter if information is spread out like a box of dropped tooth picks all over the formal and informal scientific digital landscape in preprints, papers, posters, websites, blog posts, social media – it is still findable, as long as it is digital, attached to a PID, and available for indexing. So my mission is, simply, to find out which important-to-neuroinformatics research objects are not yet findable, and change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-05905-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;The micropolitics of implementation; a qualitative study exploring the impact of power, authority, and influence when implementing change in healthcare teams&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;How can healthcare implementation be understood through a political lens?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A study by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Rogers et al&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. explored the effect of micropolitics, the use of power, authority, and influence, on implementation processes in the healthcare context. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of healthcare teams, healthcare professionals have discipline-specific priorities and expectations. Thus, multidisciplinary teams must reach agreements in spite of their divergent organizational priorities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Rogers et al&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. sought to address how micropolitics influences implementation processes by utilizing a multiple case study design and a theoretical framework.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12230 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;368&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/12/micropolitics-of-healthcare-300x156.jpg&quot; width=&quot;707&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The qualitative analysis revealed that implementing change is an inherently political process in the healthcare context. Hierarchical systems were exemplified in both case studies; however, the impact of the hierarchy differed across settings. The first theme of the micropolitics of implementation was utilizing the hierarchy to exert influence. The physicians were identified as important “role models” in implementing change. Senior managers served similarly to senior physicians, though their role was perceived to have less influence on staff engagement. Additionally, clinical nurse managers played an important role as the “middle-man” to liaise between the disciplines. In one instance, the clinical nurse manager’s rejection of the intervention led to a lack of information amongst the team, negatively impacting implementation. In each instance, the hierarchy structure impacted how team members related to the intervention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Teams often described a culture of “put up or shut up”. Staff articulated how the hierarchy made them feel “constrained” and “beaten down”, ultimately le&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;ading team members to fear expressing their personal opinions regarding the intervention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The second theme that emerged was how traditional power structures constrained implementation. Teams often described a culture of “put up or shut up”. Staff articulated how the hierarchy made them feel “constrained” and “beaten down”, ultimately leading team members to fear expressing their personal opinions regarding the intervention. Furthermore, the hierarchy of the team impacted how the staff viewed the intervention relating to their influence on the decision. While some staff felt the intervention offered them an opportunity to participate as members of the team and to “have a voice”, which led to more consistent attendance throughout implementation, other members felt the implementation was irrelevant to their role, resulting in poor adoption of the intervention. Finally, silo working, or working in isolation rather than collaboration, negatively affected the dissemination of information within the medical team, limiting engagement. Th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;us, the hierarchy also impacted cross-disciplinary interactions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;These findings ultimately apply the micropolitical concepts of power, authority and influence to the healthcare context in hopes of providing insight on how to develop more appropriate implementation strategies. The thematic analysis and knowledge of the “everyday politics” of healthcare will certainly help develop a framework for successful implementation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-05915-x?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Defining culturally safe primary care for people who use substances: a participatory concept mapping study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In the midst of the global opioid crisis, developing safe care parameters for people who use substances is essential. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Urbanoski et al&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. conducted focus groups with a variety of individuals who use or used substances, focusing on the patient perspective of safe primary care. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“I would feel safe going to the doctor if…”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Participants were recruited from peer-run organizations that provide support and advocacy to people who use substances. Participants were an average of 42.5 years, half identified as female and one quarter as Indigenous. Following several rounds of focus groups focused around the statement “I would feel safe going to the doctor if…”, the participants produced a cluster map as a “comprehensive and meaningful” representation of the data. The clusters can be summarized as the following:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Act to prevent stigma: Don’t treat me like crap!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; This cluster deals with the external and internal stigma associated with substance use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Hey I’m human. Treat me right!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Similar to Cluster 1, this cluster reflects the importance of humane and compassionate care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Uphold professional standards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. Cluster 3 primarily focuses on professional competency, particularly around pain management and how providers can recognize patients’ experience of pain as legitimate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Do you care about me? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;How can physicians develop trust with their patients? This cluster speaks to the importance of personalized care, continuity of care, and developing rapport. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Maintain my confidentiality in a welcoming and comfortable environment&lt;/i&gt;. Cluster 5 articulates concerns around the waiting room environment and clinic practices. Participants described crowded waiting rooms and limited privacy in conversation as chief stressors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Be a champion for advocacy&lt;/i&gt;. How can primary care providers address issues of accessibility and support to improve perceived safety in accessing care? Cluster 6 states examples such as allowing the presence of advocates or friends at appointments, providing care in discrete locations, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acknowledge and accommodate my needs and circumstances&lt;/i&gt;. Cluster 7 identifies how circumstances impact plans of care. Participants indicated the desire for increased forgiveness of missed appointments, understanding fear of being criminalized for the disclosure of drug use, and more. Each of these statements asked primary care providers to recognize the “structural conditions” that impact accessing healthcare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Don’t red flag me: Recognize addiction as a health issue&lt;/i&gt;. The final cluster addresses how a physician’s view of addiction as a health issue, not a criminal behavior, helps people who use substances feel safe in seeking care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ultimately, these focus groups provide a starting point for improving the delivery of compassionate primary care to people who use substances. This model provides concrete, patient-centered suggestions for improving primary care processes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;BMC Endocrine Disorders  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcendocrdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12902-020-00649-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Impact of malnutrition on systemic immune and metabolic profiles in type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Nutrition has a large impact for diabetes patients and can be linked to managing the condition. Typically associated with overweight or obese patients, this condition is being tracked within malnourished populations and how it affects the individuals’ immunological and metabolic profiles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It was found that people with a low BMI, or those suffering from malnutrition, had decreased levels of glycemic, hormonal, and cytokine parameters and were therefore less likely to be able to manage Type 2 Diabetes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Malnutrition has been linked to negatively affecting the immunology of a patient and increasing their mortality &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;from infections. It was hypothesized that a low BMI alters the pancreatic hormone, adipocytokine, and cytokines in Type 2 Diabetes patients, resulting in an increased risk for a more sever&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;e form. Covering 88 participants, this study found strong links to BMI and immune response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It was found that people with a low BMI, or those suffering from malnutrition, had decreased levels of glycemic, hormonal, and cytokine parameters and were therefore less likely to be able to manage Type 2 Diabetes. Consequently, BMI was also associated with the immunological parameters of patients, with normal BMIs having a significant positive correlation for immune response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Many Australians report that they &lt;/span&gt;consult naturopaths, but what does this mean for their health?&lt;i&gt; Steel et al&lt;/i&gt;. evaluated the relationship between health behavior and consultations with naturopaths in Australian women among three age cohorts (19-25, 31-36, and 62-67).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Through analyzing the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (ALSWH), they found that women of all cohorts who had consulted with a naturopath in the last 12 months were less likely to smoke, more likely to report at least moderate levels of physical activity, and more likely to have a vegetarian diet. Additionally, women who had consulted with naturopaths were also more likely to have used marijuana or illicit drugs in the last 12 months. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Further research is needed to understand this relationship between naturopaths and health behaviors, but this study uncovered opportunities for naturopaths to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;support health behaviors and minimize risky behaviors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Unjumbling contaminated DNA in ancient specimens pose issues for cost-effective sequencing and interpretation. Identifying the contamination between human and faunal DNA has the benefit of being able to affect analyses when mapping the reference genomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This work focuses on the most effective method to competitively map human contamination from ancient faunal DNA with reduced losses of data, thus acting as a beneficial tool within ancient DNA research. This was achieved through the sequencing of genomic data from 70 ancient and historical mammalian specimens, including an ancient favorite: the wooly mammoth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Systematic reviews are arguably the most robust form of research evidence. However, as the literature becomes continually more saturated with these reviews, it is more difficult to identify relevant reviews addressing specific questions. How can the scientific community keep up?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12231 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;242&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/12/epis-database-300x122.jpg&quot; width=&quot;594&quot; /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;On behalf of the Epistemonikos project, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Rada et al&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. developed a database called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epistemonikos.org/&quot;&gt;Epistemonikos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; of more than 300,000 systematic reviews, making it the largest database of its kind. The included reviews were selected using a machine-based approach, which were then validated by a network of over 1000 collaborators. This database is a free, multilingual, and quality-checked “one-stop shop” for systematic reviews.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Australia’s sexual minority adult population (LGBTQIA+) are difficult to estimate as the Australian Bureau of Statistics does not publish or collect any data on sexual identity. Therefore, this work attempted to provide this estimate and fill the gaps in the latest census data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Combining data from multiple national surveys and population data, average prevalence rate produced an estimate of Australia’s sexual minority population – utilising data from the General Social Survey (GSS) and the Household, Income And Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey.  It was found that Australia’s sexual minority was higher in the younger population and steadily increased with surveys conducted in later years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It was found that Australia’s sexual minority was higher in the younger population and steadily increased with surveys conducted in later years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Proposing a potential cohort effect for this trend, it is suggested sexual identities can be influenced by social attitudes and the legal environment of the time. Younger cohorts have spent their formative years within a time of higher acceptance of sexual identity and the willingness to disclose one’s identity. This cohort effect has the potential to impact future population surveys and the percentage of Australia’s known sexual minority population.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was the informal start of our Veganuary. I went shopping for core vegan staples and a few upcoming easy meals, and we made our first vegan lunch: vegan gyros in pita bread, with oat créme fraîche, vegetables, hummus, roasted onion flakes, and vegan feta.  Everyone was postively surprised – the vegan gyros was tender and flavourful, the fraîche was to everyone’s liking, and the feta was eerily much like the original. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also discussed implementation and focus, and came to agreement: 1) major focus: sustainability and being planet friendly. No flight transports or unneccessarily long transports if local alternatives exist. 2) secondary focus: health. We might as well diversify our carbohydrates while changing things around. More beans and lentils. 3) Needs to be family compatible. The kids will sometimes get their usual fare, but will be encouraged to try alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, I aim to take a generally more planet-friendly month, focused on re-use and DIY, aiming for second hand and pre-used where available. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How does the brain work and how can we understand it? I want to make it a habit to report some of the thoughts about the brain that marked me most during the past twelve month at the end of each year – with the hope to advance and structure the progress in the part of my understanding of the brain that is not immediately reflected in journal publications. Enjoy the read! And check out previous year-end write-ups: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2018/12/30/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain/&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2019/12/31/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2019/&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2021/01/01/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2020/&quot;&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doing experiments in neuroscience means opening Pandora’s box. On a daily basis, you’re confronted with the vexing fact that the outcome of experiments is not only slightly, but much more complex and variable than any mental model you could come up with. It is rewarding and soothing to read published stories about scientific findings, but they often become stories only because things which did not fit in were omitted or glossed over. This is understandable to some extent, since nobody wants to read 379 side-notes on anecdotal and potentially confusing observations. But it leads to a striking gap between headlines with clear messages, and the feeling of being overwhelmed by complexity when doing experiments or going through a raw dataset. It is possible to overcome this complexity by nested analysis pipelines (‘source’ extraction, unsupervised clustering, inclusion criteria, dimensionality reduction, etc.) and to restore simplicity. But the confusion often comes back when going back to the raw, unreduced data, because they contain so much more complexity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this year’s write-up, I want to address this complexity of the brain from the perspective of self-organized systems, and I will try to point out lines of research that can, in my opinion, contribute to an understanding of these systems in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Complex systems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I have been writing about the limitation of the human mind to deal with the brain’s complexity, and the reasons behind this limitations (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2018/09/15/entanglement-of-temporal-and-spatial-scales-in-the-brain-but-not-in-the-mind/&quot;&gt;Entanglement of temporal and spatial scales in the brain but not in the mind&lt;/a&gt;). This year, I again have been thinking quite a bit about these issues. During summer, in the bookshelf of a friend, I noticed the novel &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(novel)&quot;&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/a&gt;, which my friend, to my surprise, recommended to me. The book, more so than the movie, tells the story of how a complex system – the Jurassic Park – cannot be controlled because of unexpected interactions within the system that were thought to be separated by design. This perspective is represented in the book by a smart-ass physicist who had worked on chaos theory. He not only predicts that all will be going downhill from the start, but also provides lengthy rants about the hubris of men who think they can control complexity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This threw me back to the days when I studied physics myself, actually also with a focus on complex systems: non-linear dynamics, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, chaos control and biophysics. So, with some years in neuroscience behind me, I went back to the theory of complex systems. I started to go through a very easy-to-read book on the topic by Melanie Mitchell: &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/13/2/reviews/3.html&quot;&gt;Complexity: A Guided Tour&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://melaniemitchell.me/&quot;&gt;Melanie Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; is herself a researcher in complexity science. She did her PhD work with Douglas Hofstadter, famously known for his book &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach&quot;&gt;Gödel, Escher, Bach&lt;/a&gt;. Mitchell summarizes the history and ideas of her field in a refreshingly modest and self-critical way, which I can only recommend. As another bonus point, the book was published in 2009, just before deep learning emerged as a highly dominant idea – which also suppressed and overshadowed many other interesting lines of thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6701&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6701&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;mitchell&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/mitchell.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/mitchell.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/mitchell.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;3956,2432&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/mitchell/&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/mitchell.png?w=1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, Mitchell brings up John von Neumann’s idea of self-organization in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_cellular_automaton&quot;&gt;cellular automata&lt;/a&gt;, Douglas Hofstadter’s work, Alan Turing’s idea of self-organization in simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_pattern&quot;&gt;reaction-diffusion systems&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics:_Or_Control_and_Communication_in_the_Animal_and_the_Machine&quot;&gt;cybernetics&lt;/a&gt; movement around Norbert Wiener, Hermann Haken’s concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_(Haken)&quot;&gt;Synergetics&lt;/a&gt;, and Stephen Wolfram’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Kind_of_Science&quot;&gt;A New Kind of Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many of these ideas about complex systems were intellectually inspiring, and certainly influenced many people; but at the same time they often did not really hold their promise and did not have a similar real-work impact outside of the philosophical realm, in contrast to for example the development of semiconductors or the backpropagation in neuronal networks. On one side, ideas around self-organization like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis&quot;&gt;Autopoiesis&lt;/a&gt; concept invented by Montana and Varela were riddled with ill-defined concepts and often connected to ideas like “emergence”, “cognition” or “consciousness” in very vague ways. On the other side of the spectrum, many very influential researchers like Douglas Hofstadter or Stephen Wolfram had a very strong mathematical background and therefore were fascinated by beauty and simplicity rather than truely high-dimensional chaos. I think it’s fascinating to proof that a cellular automaton like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life&quot;&gt;Game of Life&lt;/a&gt; is Turing-complete (i.e., it is a universal computer), but wouldn’t a practical application of such an automaton be more convincing and useful than a theoretical proof?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is therefore tempting for an experimentalist and natural scientist to simply trash the entire field as verbal acrobatics that will not help to understand complex systems like the brain. However, in the next section I’d like to make the point why I think the concept of self-organized systems should still be considered as potentially central when it comes to understanding the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Self-organized systems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the last years, I have become more and more convinced that complex systems cannot be easily understood by simply describing their behavior. Even for very simple complex phenomena like the Lorenz equations, where the behavior of the system can be described by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor#Strange_attractor&quot;&gt;strange attractors&lt;/a&gt;, this description can only provide a low-dimensional description which allows to predict the behavior of the system, but it does not tell much about the generative processes underlying the respective phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Low-dimensional descriptions of brain activity are one of the most active areas of current research in neuroscience. This can range from a description of brain dynamics in terms of oscillatory regimes, to default mode networks of the human brain, or more recently to attempts to break down the population activity of thousands of neurons into a low-dimensional manifold. These are beautiful  descriptions of neuronal activities, and it is certainly useful to study the brain with these approaches. But does it provide us with a real understanding? From one perspective, one could say that such a condensed description (if it exists, which is not yet clear) would be a form of deep understanding, since any way to compress a description is some sort of understanding. But I think there should be a deeper way of understanding that focuses on the underlying generative processes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to understand artificial neural networks (deep networks). One way would be to investigate information flows and how representations of the input evolve across different layers and become less similar to the input and more similar to the respective target label. This is an operative and valuable way to understand of what is going on. In my opinion, it would however allow for a deeper understanding to simply bring up the very organizing principles which underlie the generation of the network: back-propagation of errors during learning, the definition of the loss function and the deep feed-forward network architecture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I think it would be equally more interesting in neuroscience to understand the generative and organizing principles which underlie the final structure of the brain, instead of studying the representations of information in neuronal activity. It is clear that a part of the organization of the brain is encoded in the genome, for example as guidance cues for axonal growth or as the program of sequential migration of cell types, and in addition also the coarse specific connectivity across different cell types. However, the more flexible, and possibly also more interesting part, is probably not organized by an external designer (like a deep network) and also not directly organized by the genome. In the absence of an external designing instance, there must be self-organization at work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once we accept that this part of the generative principles underlying the brain structure and function is self-organization, it becomes immediately clear that it might be useful to get inspired by complexity science and the study of self-organized systems. This connection between neuroscience is probably evident to anybody working on complex systems, but I have the impression that this perspective is sometimes lost by systems neuroscience and in particular experimental neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Self-organizing principles of neuronal networks: properties of single neurons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I believe that the most relevant building blocks of self-organization in the brain are single neurons (and not molecules, synapses or brain areas). A year ago, I have argued why I think this makes sense from an evolutionary perspective (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2019/12/31/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2019/&quot;&gt;Annual report of my intuition about the brain (2019)&lt;/a&gt;), and I argued why would be interesting to understand the objective function of a single cell: so-to-speak the single-cell specific generative principle that underlies the self-organization of biological neuronal networks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Realistically speaking, this is too abstract a way of exploring biological neurons. What would be a less condensed way to describe the self-organizing principles underlying single neurons that are analogous to back-propagation and loss functions for deep networks? I would tend to mention main ingredients: First, the principles that determine the integration of inputs in a single neuron. Second, the principles that determine the way that neurons connect and modify their mutual connections – which is basically nothing but plasticity rules between neurons. I am convinced that the integrative properties of neurons and the plasticity rules of a neuron when interacting with other cells are the main ingredients that are together the self-organizing principles of neuronal networks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a somewhat underwhelming conclusion, because both plasticity rules and integrative properties of neurons have been studied very intensely since the 1990s. The detour of this blog post about self-organization basically reframes what a certain branch of neuroscience has been studying anyway. However, in addition it makes – in my opinion – also clear why the study of population dynamics and low-dimensional descriptions of neuronal activity aims at a different level of understanding. And it makes the point that the deepest understanding of biosimilar networks can probably be achieved by studying the aspects of self-organizing agents, plasticity rules and single-cell integrative properties, and not by studying the pure behavior of animals or neuronal networks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Studying self-organized neuronal networks and plasticity rules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, how can we study these principles of self-organized agents? Unfortunately, the last 30 years have made it quite clear that there is not simply a single universal plasticity rule. Typical plasticity rules (spike-time dependent plasticity; fire-together-wire-together; NMDA-dependent potentiation) usually explain only a small fraction of the variance in the experimental data and can often be only studied in very specific experimental conditions, and in most cases only in slice work. Usually, the conditions of the experiment (number of presynaptic action potentials to induce plasticity, spike frequency, etc.) are tuned to achieve strong effects, and absence of effects in other conditions are not systematically studied and often go unreported. In addition, plasticity rules &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; seem to be somewhat different. Neuromodulation and other state-dependent influences might affect plasticity rules in ways that make them almost impossible to study systematically. In addition, it is very likely that there is not a single plasticity rule that governs the same behavior across all all neurons, since diversity of properties has been shown in simulations to provide robustness to neuronal circuits at many different levels. And evolution has would be a fool not to make use of this property that is so easy to achieve – evolution does not care about being hard to reverse engineer. This however makes it merely impossible (although still very valuable!) to dissect these principles systematically in experiments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is why I think that simulations – not experiments – could be the best starting point for understanding these self-organized networks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is indeed a large body of work going into this direction. If you google for “self-organizing neuronal networks”, you will find a huge literature which goes back to the 60s and is often based on very simplistic models of neurons (still heavily inspired by condensed matter physics), but there are also some interesting more recent papers that directly combine modern plasticity rules with the idea of self-organization (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.10.023.2009/full&quot;&gt;Lazar et al., 2009&lt;/a&gt;). And there are not few computational labs that study plasticity rules and their effect on the organization of neuronal networks, which is also some kind of self-organization, e.g. the labs of &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=m0v2CxEAAAAJ&quot;&gt;Henning Sprekeler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=jy5yBV4AAAAJ&quot;&gt;Claudia Clopath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=RsHPZroAAAAJ&quot;&gt;Tim Vogels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.ch/citations?hl=en&amp;amp;user=_IxvO8QAAAAJ&quot;&gt;Friedemann Zenke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2HXsblgAAAAJ&quot;&gt;Richard Naud&lt;/a&gt;, all of them influenced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=dqBH37QAAAAJ&quot;&gt;Wulfram Gerstner&lt;/a&gt;; or  &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PCzuQX8AAAAJ&quot;&gt;Sophie Deneuve&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-4z7V1oAAAAJ&quot;&gt;Christian Machens&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2WpvdH0AAAAJ&quot;&gt;Wolfgang Maass&lt;/a&gt; – to name just few out of many people who work on this topic. I think this is one of the most interesting fields of theoretical neuroscience. However, I would be personally very satisfied to see this field shift towards a better inclusion of the self-organizing perspective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To give a random example, in a study from this year, Naumann and Sprekeler show how specific non-linear properties of neurons can mitigate a well-known problem associated with purely Hebbian plasticity rules (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/02/12/2020.02.11.944082&quot;&gt;Presynaptic inhibition rapidly stabilises recurrent excitationin the face of plasticity, 2020&lt;/a&gt;). They basically take an experimental finding that has been made quite some time ago (pre-synaptic inhibition of the axonal boutons via GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors) and builds a model that explains how this could make sense in the light of plasticity rules. This is a very valuable way of doing research, also because it takes biological details of neurons into account and gives the experimentalists a potential context and explanation of their findings. However, this approach seems to be the perspective of a designer or engineer, rather than the approach of somebody who aims at an understanding of a self-organized system. What would be an alternative approach?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From engineered organization to self-organization&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think it would be useful to take the perspective of a neuron, and in addition also an evolutionary perspective. Let’s say, a neuron with certain properties (rules on when and how to connect) joins the large pool of a recurrent network. The question which must be solved by the neuron is: How do I learn how to behave meaningfully?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’d like to give an analogy on how I think this neuron should ideally behave: A human person that interacts with others in a social network, be it in real life or in the virtual world, must adjust their actions according to how they are received. Shouting loud all the time will isolate them, because they are blocking the receiving channels of others, and being silent all the time will let others equally drop the connections. To adjust the level of output and to adjust the appropriate content that will be well-received, it is crucial to listen to feedback.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is what I think could be the central question from this self-organized perspective of neuronal circuits: How does the neuron get feedback on its own actions? And with feedback, I do not mean global error signals about the behavior of the organism via neuromodulation channels, but  feedback on the neuron’s action potentials and its other actions. Where does this feedback come from?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we reduce the complex network to a single cell, we can immediately see the answer to this question, the feedback comes from the external world. A spike of this “neuron” has a direct impact on the world, and the world in return acts back upon the “neuron”. It is not clear how this scales up to larger networks, but I think that this inclusion of the external world, as opposed to a machine learning-style input-output task, could be the most important ingredient that makes the step from engineered network organizations to self-organized networks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(There are many loose connections from here to reinforcement learning using learning agents and also to predictive processing, but let’s not go into that here.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion and summary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The conclusions of this write-up might sound trivial from some perspective; and again others might say that these ideas will not lead anywhere, similar to many previous suggestions in the field of complex self-organized systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m glad to become convinced otherwise, but today I think that a very promising way to achieve a deep understanding of the brain could consist of the following ingredients, as motivated above:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;1) To regard the brain as a at least partially self-organized network,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2) To use simulations together with evolutionary algorithms to explore the generative / self-organizing principles,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3) To consider properties and actions on the level of single neurons as the main parameters that can be modified during this evolutionary process and&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;4) To include an external world to transition from an externally organized to a self-organized system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Podcasts have been growing quickly in numbers during the last years, and I didn’t really clue in to that until I re-joined LinkedIn in the middle of the year for other work purposes – and suddenly, it seemed whoever I checked and followed had a podcast. Or had just started a podcast – it is apparently the Professional Thing To Do in the 2020’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently, my life mostly lacks quiet time to sit down (or go for walks) and listen to podcasts, so I have been amassing an ever-growing long list of interesting, possible podcasts to listen to; it is very low effort to follow more podcasts now that they are available on Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I used to listen to a lot of podcasts some years ago, when the kids were still small enough to need daily long walks in a stroller. It was mainly &lt;a href=&quot;https://escapepod.org/about-us/&quot;&gt;EscapePod&lt;/a&gt; and a few different Swedish Radio pods, and a very nice podcast with some of my favourite authors chatting about different things, the &lt;a data-id=&quot;https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/sf-squeecast-elizabeth-bear-paul-cornell-ruFYCBDg8Gi/&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; href=&quot;https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/sf-squeecast-elizabeth-bear-paul-cornell-ruFYCBDg8Gi/&quot;&gt;SFSqueecast&lt;/a&gt;,  but it ended long ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, my project for 2021 is: take the looong list of podcasts I currently subscribe to, and trial them to see which ones are worth keeping long term.  I have one nominee for the list already, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orion-openscience.eu/publications/training-materials/201902/podcasts&quot;&gt;ORION Open Science podcast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;I own a lot of books. Nowadays, I mostly buy Kindle books, since the bookshelves had to go when we got twins. I now own about 700 books on Kindle, of which 400+ are read at least once. This is the result of one single Twitter account (mostly), &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sfsignal&quot;&gt;@SFSignal&lt;/a&gt;, that tweets sales of SF and other fantastic fiction, under the tag &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/sff_eBookDeal?src=hashtag_click&quot;&gt;sff_eBookDeal&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the books go for as low as $1-$2, and that’s where the majority of my digital library comes from.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also own a lot of actual, physical SFF books. Nearly all paperbacks. We used to have a high shelf for my books along the walls of our entry hall, but when we switched apartments a few years back, that had to go. It swallowed at least 150 books, that now lying in boxes in the cellar storage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we started the Matmolekyler project, we started out with buying useful books. I have a bunch of those in my bookshelves (including some I got myself, or as gifts: several books by HaroldMcGee, two priced *signed* books by Gordon Shepherd). Since then, I try to buy food-science-related books when I find them at reaonable prices. That collection is now about 50 books.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also went through a period where I was thinking a lot about food and cooking history, so I tried to find some of the earlier real cookbooks (and school household training books) from the early 1900s. There are typically cheap and abundant at used book stores, so by now I have quite a few. Including one I got at a museum, which is a copy of a 1800s cookbook along with a companion book written by a historian). And a set of two old ~1800s household encyclopedias in a new edition from a Swedish agricultural society (I had to order them special and pick them up in person). Let’s say, another 40 or so books.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For 2021, I hope to rearrange all of our (mine, really) bookshelves so that I have more SFF books accessible (since I want to re-read them anyway). I hope to inventory and index all books, and maybe even get rid of some. I need to find some good book inventory software – I have Goodreads but haven’t really used it for sorting books yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/web.cdn.scouterna.net/uploads/sites/59/2019/09/2019-07-17-114825-e1567370272989-615x820.jpg?resize=615%2C820&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; /&gt;The founder of Adolf Fredrik scoutkår, Ivar Åkerfelt.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My kids wanted to join the Scouts, so we put them in the queue for our local Scoutkår, Adolf Fredriks. Kids whose parents agree to help with (co)leading get boosted higher in the queue, and I do have earlier experience, so I indicated my willingness to help. And then we waited.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not for long, it took maybe a month or so. No regular meetings were held, but we tried to meet up on Zoom each week (and if you have ever wondered why Zoom etiquette is needed, try meeting with a group of eight-year-olds and try to get them to follow a program).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been no outside activities yet, but that is our likely next step, so we have gone over what outdoor equipment we have and what we need. Black Friday let us buy two good sleeping bags for a good price. The kids’ great-grandmother gave them each a good outdoor backpack. I found myself hiking boots, outdoor trousers and a decent size backpack (~50 l ) on sales. Rainjackets, -trousers and boots/waterproof shoes we already have, because of Stockholm winters. We also got two pairs of skates and helmets for the kids, because one of the possible future activities is the skating ice frozen in the nearby Vasaparken, arranged every winter season by the local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So for the next year at least, I will be the co-leader of a troop of 8-year-old scouts (who will turn 9 during the year).  I have so many ideas for fun stuff to do, based on my own years in the Mjölby scoutkår at home.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<updated>2020-12-31T09:32:36+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The CMX holiday letter states: “&lt;em&gt; I just reviewed the data with the research team and one thing is crystal clear: community has become an irreplaceable part of business. In a year where a lot of businesses struggled, and there were many layoffs, community teams actually grew. And companies of all sizes, in all industries, are going to be investing in community in a big way next year&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have a standing alert for community-related position ads on LinkedIn, and see clearly a parallell increase in community positions offered in science &amp;amp; academia.  Where ads earlier have been implicit about the community aspects, hiding it under terms such as ‘field knowledge’, nearly everyone knows and admits to some degree that in academia, it is impossible to succeed without community support. It is built into the system that your peers will (hopefully) acknowledge you and lift your work up – this mechanism is seen in such academic pillars as peer review, recommendation letters, and hiring committees, to name some examples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since I did my AAAS Community Fellowship in 2017, a training program that ran twice and which has now transformed into an independent organisation called CSCCE, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cscce.org/&quot;&gt;Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement&lt;/a&gt; , I have been an active member in the community that surrounds CSCCE. We have a lot of interesting activites and projects around community management – interest groups (I’m in the Open Science SIG and lurking in the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion SIG), projects (I’m in one we started in 2017, aiming to describe and pin down community manager skillsets), and Working Groups (I’m in the Community Champions WG).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The theme for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cmxhub.com/announcing-this-years-community-manager-advancement-day-theme-resilience&quot;&gt;2021 Community Manager Advancement Day&lt;/a&gt;, which takes place on January 25, is resilience. A very fitting theme, after this Covid year. Resilience of self, when the world stops around you; resilience of communities to chaos and changes; resilience of organizations and society – where community has a huge part.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
