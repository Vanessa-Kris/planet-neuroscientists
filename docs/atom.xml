&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The auditory cortex is found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/temporal-lobe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;temporal lobe&lt;/a&gt;. Most of it is hidden from view, buried deep within a fissure called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/lateral-sulcus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lateral sulcus&lt;/a&gt;. Some auditory cortex is visible on the external surface the brain, however, as it extends to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gyrus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gyrus&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/superior-temporal-gyrus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;superior temporal gyrus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The auditory cortex can be subdivided into multiple regions, although there is still some question about the most appropriate way to create those subdivisions in the human brain. There is general agreement, however, that the auditory cortex consists of a primary area—which is often referred to as the &lt;em&gt;core&lt;/em&gt; region—as well as multiple non-primary areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The primary auditory cortex in humans is hidden within the lateral sulcus on a collection of gyri known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/heschls-gyri&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Heschl’s gyri&lt;/a&gt; (aka the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/transverse-temporal-gyri&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transverse temporal gyri&lt;/a&gt;). The precise location of the primary region in humans is variable, however, as is the arrangement of Heschl’s gyri (some people have one of these gyri, while others have two or three). For example, in some individuals the primary auditory cortex seems to occupy one Heschl’s gyrus, while in others it may extend past that gyrus into a neighboring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/sulcus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sulcus&lt;/a&gt; (or beyond).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The region adjacent to the core is often referred to as the &lt;em&gt;belt&lt;/em&gt; region, and surrounding that is an area often called the &lt;em&gt;parabelt &lt;/em&gt;region. These neighboring areas are mostly buried within the lateral sulcus as well, but may extend out to the superior temporal gyrus. The demarcations of the auditory cortex in general, however, are imprecise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-rte-preserve-empty=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the auditory cortex and what does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The auditory cortex plays a critical role in our ability to perceive sound. It is thought to be integral to our perception of the fundamental aspects of an auditory stimulus, like the pitch of the sound. But it is also important in various other aspects of sound processing, like determining where in space a sound originates from as well as identifying what might be producing the sound. The auditory cortex is also thought to be involved in higher-level auditory processing, such as recognizing aspects of sound that are specific to speech. Damage to the auditory cortex can disrupt various facets of auditory perception. For example, damage (e.g., like that caused by a stroke) might cause deficits in the ability to detect changes in pitch, localize sounds in space, or understand speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The auditory cortex primarily receives auditory information from a nucleus in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thalamus&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/medial-geniculate-nucleus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;medial geniculate nucleus&lt;/a&gt;, which is where all incoming information about hearing is sent before it is processed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebral-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cerebral cortex&lt;/a&gt;. Cells in the primary region of the auditory cortex  (and in some parts of the non-primary regions as well) are arranged so they form what is known as a &lt;em&gt;tonotopic&lt;/em&gt; map. What this means is that different areas of the auditory cortex are involved in processing different sound frequencies. (&lt;em&gt;Frequency&lt;/em&gt;, when referring to sound waves, is related to &lt;em&gt;pitch&lt;/em&gt;. High frequency sound waves lead to high-pitched sounds.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The tonotopic arrangement of the primary auditory cortex is similar to what is seen in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cochlea&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cochlea&lt;/a&gt;, where sound processing begins. Thus, it can be said that the core of the auditory cortex contains a map of the cochlea, with each point in the cochlea corresponding to a strip of cells in the auditory cortex. This type of arrangement is similar to what is seen in other sensory cortices (e.g., the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/primary-somatosensory-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;primary somatosensory cortex&lt;/a&gt; contains a map of the sensory receptors of the body).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are thought to be other patterns of functional organization of the primary auditory cortex as well, although the importance of these patterns in hearing is still poorly understood. For example, there seem to be cells (EI cells) in the auditory cortex that are activated only by stimuli coming from one ear; they are inhibited by stimuli coming from the other ear. Other cells (EE cells) are activated by information coming from both ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sensory processing in the areas surrounding the primary auditory cortex is also not well understood, but it is thought that cells in the belt and parabelt are involved in higher-level processing of complex sounds. For example, research suggests these non-primary areas of the auditory cortex may be important in recognizing species-specific vocalizations, which implies they play a role in processing speech in humans. Studies have also found the non-primary auditory regions to be involved in distinct aspects of speech perception, like detecting the beginning and end of syllables, attending to one voice while ignoring another, and processing sounds in a logical temporal order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Overall, there is still much to be learned about the fine details of auditory processing in the auditory cortex. It is clear, however, that this part of the brain plays a critical role in creating the rich sensory experience of hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-rte-preserve-empty=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;References (in addition to linked text above):&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amunts K, Morosan P, Hilbig H, Zilles K.

 &lt;p&gt;There’s nothing Winifred Frick likes better than crawling through guano-filled caves and coming face-to-face with bats. As chief scientist of Bat Conservation International, she is on a mission to promote understanding of bats and protect imperiled species from extinction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For months, though, Frick has avoided research that would put her within spitting distance of bats. Her only projects to persist through the pandemic have been conducted from afar, like using acoustic monitors to eavesdrop on the animals’ squeaks and swooshes. In an era of COVID-19, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008758&quot;&gt;that “hands-off” approach and other precautions are crucial to protect both bats and people&lt;/a&gt;, Frick, a biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and over two dozen other scientists argue online September 3 in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why the call to action? SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-not-human-made-lab-genetic-analysis-nature&quot;&gt;likely originated in bats in China&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/26/20&lt;/em&gt;). But neither it nor other coronaviruses belonging to the same genus — &lt;em&gt;Betacoronavirus —&lt;/em&gt; have been detected in the more than 40 bat species in North America, although the animals do harbor other types of coronaviruses. Scientists are not worried about catching SARS-CoV-2 &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; these bats. They’re afraid of giving it &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; the bats — not an impossibility, the authors argue, given that the United States leads the world in infections, with nearly 8 million as of October 16.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We can’t tell bats to socially distance,” Frick says. “We want to reduce the chance that there’s any pathogen transfer across animals, full stop.” The goal is to prevent viral “spillover.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Biologist Winifred Frick&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3092408&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/101620_jo_bat_inline_680-675x450.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3092408&quot;&gt;Biologist Winifred Frick advocates for distanced research methods and extra protective gear to safeguard North American bats from the coronavirus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3092408&quot;&gt;Alan Hicks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Human-to-bat transmission isn’t an unheard-of scenario. People are likely to blame for introducing &lt;em&gt;Pseudogymnoascus destructans, &lt;/em&gt;the fungus that causes white nose syndrome, to North American bats. The disease has killed millions of bats &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/white-nose-bat-disease-jumps-rockies-washington-state&quot;&gt;throughout the United States and Canada&lt;/a&gt; since it was first detected in 2006 &lt;em&gt;(SN: 3/31/16)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s unknown if bats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, or if the virus would make them sick — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bats-immune-system-viruses-ebola-marburg-people&quot;&gt;bats rarely become ill from the viruses they carry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(SN: 2/12/20). &lt;/em&gt;But infected bats might spread the virus back to humans, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Worse, introducing SARS-CoV-2 to other coronaviruses carried by North American bats could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bats-china-carry-all-ingredients-make-new-sars-virus&quot;&gt;provide the ingredients for creating a new virus&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/30/17).&lt;/em&gt; Either scenario could stoke pre-existing fears about bats spreading disease, presenting a major hurdle for bat conservationists trying to bolster support for the animals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s bat specialist group, which includes Frick, initially advocated for the hands-off approach in April. Because so little was known in the early days of the pandemic about how SARS-CoV-2 spreads, that group recommended that researchers shut down any projects that involved interacting with bats. In August, the group &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucnbsg.org/bsg-publications.html&quot;&gt;updated its guidelines to also address&lt;/a&gt; spelunking and other activities that might bring humans into bat habitat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The guidelines still recommend replacing fieldwork with distanced alternatives whenever possible. Picking through guano can identify bat species and reveal the viruses they carry, and cameras positioned outside bat caves and roosts can give a sense of abundance. Scientists can even resurrect evidence of pathogens held in the preserved tissues of bat specimens in museums.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But not all bat research can be socially distanced, and that means taking pandemic precautions, like ensuring field crews aren’t sick with COVID-19 and are wearing personal protective gear. White nose syndrome research already requires disposable Tyvek suits and gloves to reduce spreading the fungus. Now, masks will be a regular part of the ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Frick, speaking up for bats has always been a part of being a bat biologist. Besides having a passion for the animals, conservation and human health are inseparable, she says. And bats provide ecosystem services that benefit humans, like pest control that &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1201366&quot;&gt;saves North American farmers more than an estimated $3.7 billion per year&lt;/a&gt;, according to a study published in 2011 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. As human populations expand into shrinking bat habitat, bats and humans increasingly cross paths, making viral spillover events and other harmful interactions more likely. The pandemic has intensified those risks, and for Frick, put the need to speak up “on steroids now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve probably heard tales of people who are suddenly able to speak a language they didn’t know while hypnotised&lt;/strong&gt;. It goes without saying that the evidence doesn’t really support these claims — but it’s interesting that linguistics seems to attract this sort of pseudoscientific idea. At &lt;em&gt;Knowable Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowablemagazine.org/article/society/2020/fact-or-fantasy-tales-linguistic-fringe&quot;&gt;Charles Q.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroscientists are increasingly recognising the influence of our internal states, such as heart rate, on our mental processes.&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers studying “interoception” hope that a better awareness of what’s going on in the body could help people manage symptoms of anxiety and other mental health conditions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sarah-garfinkel-interoception&quot;&gt;João Medeiros has more&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We tend to place too much value on the ending of an experience, which can bias our view of the experience as a whole&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/brain-can-overvalue-a-happy-ending-study&quot;&gt;reports Ali Pattillo&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Inverse&lt;/em&gt;. A recent study found that the brain encodes the overall value of an experience in the amygdala, while dislike of a disappointing ending is represented in the insula. Whether we make good choices or are unduly influenced by the ending of an experience seems to be related to the pattern of activity in those two areas.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the internet age, pornography is more accessible than ever —&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and many people have voiced concern about its harmful effects. &lt;/strong&gt;But what does the research actually say about the consequences of viewing porn? Well, like so much in psychology, the story is complicated. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/is-pornography-harmful/&quot;&gt;Zoe Cormier explores some of the nuances&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chimpanzees show a similar pattern of “social ageing” to humans, with the size of their social networks shrinking in older age. &lt;/strong&gt;And just like us, older chimps also seem to have stronger social bonds than their younger counterparts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/22/chimps-pare-down-their-social-circle-in-later-years-study&quot;&gt;reports Ian Sample&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;An initial crop of clinical trials testing an anti-inflammatory drug against COVID-19 do not look promising.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The best available evidence among these trials “doesn’t show that this drug is beneficial,” says Adarsh Bhimraj, an infectious diseases physician at the Cleveland Clinic, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The drug, tocilizumab, is a treatment for the painful joint swelling that occurs in rheumatoid arthritis and is also used to manage a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-make-car-t-cell-therapies-cancer-safer-and-more-effective&quot;&gt;dangerous side effect of the cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt; CAR-T cell therapy (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/27/18&lt;/em&gt;). So clinical trials have been assessing whether tocilizumab might help COVID-19 patients by taming excessive inflammation as it does for these other two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The drug works by blocking the activity of a protein called interleukin 6, which contributes to the immune system’s inflammatory response. High levels of this protein, known as a cytokine, are a harbinger of severe disease in COVID-19 patients, studies have found.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Of the four clinical trials that have just reported peer-reviewed results on tocilizumab for COVID-19, only one meets the “gold standard” for evaluating a drug.  Such randomized, double-blinded controlled trials randomly assign patients to receive a drug or a placebo, and don’t reveal to participants or doctors who is getting which.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the trial with this design, tocilizumab &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2028836&quot;&gt;did not reduce the risk of intubation or death&lt;/a&gt; as of four weeks compared with the placebo, researchers reported online in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; on October 21. The study included 243 participants hospitalized with COVID-19 at seven Boston hospitals. Two-thirds received the drug, while the remainder received the placebo; participants also got other available drugs for COVID-19, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-drug-remdesivir-supply-chain&quot;&gt;remdesivir&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/13/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two other trials randomly assigned which participants received tocilizumab but did not use a placebo, and it was clear whether patients were receiving the drug or not. This knowledge can bias the interpretation of some measures of how a patient is faring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of these two studies had mixed results. Tocilizumab may have reduced the likelihood of patients needing ventilation or dying as of two weeks compared with those who didn’t receive the drug. But there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.6820?guestAccessKey=14a265c4-49ae-44a2-ac1e-4ed9bc9181f6&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=102020&quot;&gt;no difference in mortality&lt;/a&gt; between the two groups at four weeks, researchers reported online October 20 in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine.&lt;/em&gt; In the trial of 131 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia at nine hospitals in France, about half got tocilizumab along with regular care (such as antiviral drugs), while the remainder received just regular care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other study of 126 patients in 24 hospitals in Italy found that the drug didn’t appear to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.6615?guestAccessKey=05e037ab-d891-4213-b298-6b97f63fd8f7&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=102020&quot;&gt;stop the disease from getting worse&lt;/a&gt; compared with standard care, researchers reported in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine, &lt;/em&gt;also on October 20&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; About half the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia got the drug. The other half received standard care but could get tocilizumab if their condition worsened.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The data from randomized controlled trials published to date do not support routine use of tocilizumab in patients hospitalized with COVID-19,” says Carolyn Calfee, a pulmonary and critical care specialist at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, who was not involved in the trials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are some blanks still to be filled in, though. The trials didn’t evaluate patients with the most severe forms of COVID-19, namely those with acute respiratory distress syndrome on a ventilator, Calfee says. It’s also unclear whether categorizing patients by how much their interleukin 6 level is elevated might help identify patients who could benefit from the drug, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The only study that found tocilizumab helpful had a weaker design. It was an observational study, so not randomized. The participants who received the drug had different characteristics from those who didn’t, which makes it difficult to determine whether the results are due to the drug or other factors. By 30 days, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.6252?guestAccessKey=8a81e35e-df54-4c43-8729-d5d28e48b666&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=102020&quot;&gt;risk of mortality was lower&lt;/a&gt; for hospitalized patients who took the drug in the first two days upon admission than for patients who didn’t, researchers report online October 20 in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bhimraj says results from the remaining “gold standard” clinical trials still under way will be needed to better understand whether tocilizumab has a use in treating COVID-19. One trial offered preliminary results in a news release and reported that participants were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-antibodies-lab-treatment-immune-system&quot;&gt;less likely to need intubation or die&lt;/a&gt; with the drug (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/22/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaurs-bat-wings-clumsy-evolution-flying-gliding"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Only two dinosaur species are known to have had wings made out of stretched skin, like bats. But unlike bats, these dinos were capable of only limited gliding between trees, a new anatomical analysis suggests. That bat-winged gliding turned out to be a dead end along the path to the evolution of flight, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They are a failed experiment,” says Alexander Dececchi, a paleontologist at Mount Marty University in Sioux Falls, S.D.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fliers with feathered wings, rather than membranous wings, begin to appear in the fossil record just a few million years after the bat-winged dinosaurs. Those feathered fliers &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/&quot;&gt;may have outcompeted the gliders&lt;/a&gt; in their evolutionary niche, Dececchi and colleagues suggest October 22 in &lt;em&gt;iScience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaurs-ride-may-have-been-glide&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yi qi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ambopteryx longibrachium&lt;/em&gt; were crow-sized dinosaurs that lived about 160 million years ago (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/29/15&lt;/em&gt;). They were distant cousins, both belonging to a bizarre group of dinosaurs known as scansoriopterygids. Unlike other scansoriopterygids, however, these two species sported large wings with membranes, thin skin stretched between elongated arm bones.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Scansoriopterygids were a branch of theropod dinosaurs, the same group that includes giants like &lt;em&gt;Tyrannosaurus rex&lt;/em&gt; as well as the ancestors of birds. So the recent discoveries of two different bat-winged theropod dinosaurs shook up long-standing ideas about the evolution of flight in birds. Scientists had thought that path, while a bit circuitous, centered around variations of just one basic, birdlike body plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But whether &lt;em&gt;Yi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ambopteryx&lt;/em&gt; were actually adept at flying, such as being able to launch from the ground or flap their wings, wasn’t clear. To assess the dinos’ flight capability, Dececchi and colleagues used laser-stimulated fluorescence imaging, which can pick up details of soft tissues such as membranes or cartilage in fossils, to reanalyze the anatomy of &lt;em&gt;Yi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ambopteryx.&lt;/em&gt; The team made new estimations of the reptiles’ weight, wing shape and wingspan, and then simulated how those features might translate into flapping, gliding or launching.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new analyses confirm that these two dinosaurs had vastly different wing structures from the feathered-wing fliers — proving that these two flight strategies evolved independently of one another. &lt;em&gt;Yi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ambopteryx&lt;/em&gt;, for example, had elongated forelimb bones between their membranous wings, as well as a special wrist bone to help support the membrane. The skeletons of the wings of birds, on the other hand, consist of elongated metacarpals, similar to finger bones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This evolutionary branching out was ultimately a failure, Dececchi says. &lt;em&gt;Yi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ambopteryx&lt;/em&gt; were capable only of gliding short distances from tree to tree, the team found. Their body mass-to-wing ratio was a bit too high for them to stay aloft to glide longer distances.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for active flight, the dinosaurs lacked other attributes possessed by powerful fliers, whether feather-winged like birds or membrane-winged like pterosaurs and bats. For example, the orientation of the dinosaurs’ wings suggests that they weren’t designed for rotational flapping. And the dinos’ breastbones show no evidence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/archaeopteryx-had-wings-made-flapping-not-just-gliding&quot;&gt;places where key flight muscles attach&lt;/a&gt; in modern birds (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/13/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just a few million years after &lt;em&gt;Yi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ambopteryx&lt;/em&gt;, about 150 million years ago, the ancient bird &lt;em&gt;Archaeopteryx&lt;/em&gt; appears in the fossil record. Although &lt;em&gt;Archaeopteryx&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t a particularly great flier either, Dececchi says, it was a stronger glider and possibly could flap its wings a bit. Later variations on its body theme continued to improve dinosaurs’ flight ability, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That the bat-winged dinosaurs weren’t great fliers isn’t a surprise, says paleontologist Jingmai O’Connor of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, who with her colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1137-z&quot;&gt;described &lt;em&gt;Ambopteryx&lt;/em&gt; in a 2019 study in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. O’Connor notes that no bat-winged dinosaurs appear in the fossil record after the Jurassic Period, so it already seemed likely that they weren’t a successful group of dinosaurs. Still, she says, it’s important to do this kind of careful, quantitative analysis to assess flight ability — although “the fossil record of this group is really bad.” With so few fossils, many poorly preserved, any such calculations are going to be based on “very poor data.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;O’Connor says that what the animals do highlight is “the experimentation with different modes of flight,” she adds. Birds, it’s clear, weren’t the only flying dinosaurs — and these fossils reveal that flight itself, whether gliding or powered, evolved multiple times among them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have long discussed the idea that there exists a set of “dark” personality traits alongside the more benign Big Five — so much so, in fact, that one team of researchers argued that too&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/22/psychopaths-and-narcissists-have-hogged-the-limelight-now-its-time-to-explore-the-saintlier-side-of-human-personality-say-researchers-as-they-announce-a-test-of-the-light-triad-traits/&quot;&gt; much time had been spent pondering the darker side&lt;/a&gt; of human nature and that a “Light Triad” was needed to counteract it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is also debate around whether such traits — psychopathy, narcissism, Machiavellianism and sadism — are stable, or whether they can be induced. The most famous exploration of the question is almost certainly Zimbardo’s Prison Experiment, which claimed that being in a powerful position over others — in this case, acting as a prison guard — could induce sadistic behaviour in apparently non-sadistic people. The experiment’s influence is undeniable; it’s even been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XN2X72jrFk&quot;&gt;made into a film&lt;/a&gt;. But it has also been &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/03/newly-analysed-recording-challenges-zimbardos-account-of-his-infamous-prison-experiment/&quot;&gt;subject to criticism&lt;/a&gt;, casting some doubt over the extent of its findings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920305493?dgcid=rss_sd_all#s0005&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/em&gt; has joined the conversation, examining whether sadistic tendencies can be induced. The study finds that they can — particularly in people who already have some level of sadistic interest — but leaves a question mark over what that might mean for real world behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40607&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Leonie Themelidis and Jason Davies from Swansea University recruited 322 participants to take part in the study. First, participants completed the Varieties of Sadistic Tendencies measure, in which they rated themselves on various statements measuring the enjoyment of &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; sadistic or cruel behaviour (e.g. “I enjoy mocking losers to their face”) and the enjoyment of &lt;em&gt;watching&lt;/em&gt; such behaviour without taking part (e.g. “I love YouTube clips of people fighting”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, participants were split into two groups. One group saw 20 images of hands being given accidental or self-inflicted injuries (such as being cut while chopping vegetables), while a control group saw similar images without any depiction of injury. For each picture, participants completed an “empathy rating”, designed to make them think about how the person in the photograph might feel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, participants filled in another scale designed to screen sadistic personalities, rating on a scale from one to five how much they agreed with statements including “hurting people would be exciting” and “I enjoy seeing people hurt”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For their analysis, the researchers split the participants into groups depending on whether they had low, medium, or high sadism scores at the beginning of the study. Among people with low scores, those who viewed the images of harm showed very slightly higher levels of sadism at the end of the study compared to those who viewed the control images.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this effect was much more pronounced in those participants who had higher levels of sadism to begin with, supporting the hypothesis that images of harm can increase sadistic feeling. Female participants also tended to show a greater increase in sadism after viewing the pain pictures compared to males. This suggests that while to some degree sadism remains stable over time, particular states and contexts may increase it to a greater or lesser degree.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt; the images induced sadism, however, is unclear. The team makes two suggestions: that viewing pain was simply enjoyable to those with sadistic traits, or that the pictures triggered an elaborate fantasy or recall process, increasing sadistic feeling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s important not to make too strong a conclusion about what the findings might say about sadistic behaviour. For one, the follow-up measure took place immediately after viewing images of harm, so the increase in feeling experienced by the participants may not endure over time. And the team only measured sadistic feelings and tendencies, so it’s unclear whether this kind of intervention actually produces changes in people’s &lt;em&gt;behaviour&lt;/em&gt;. It’s also worth pointing out the scales included questions related to videogames (enjoying watching blood spurt in violent games) and sports (MMA matches) — things that many people enjoy harmlessly &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/06/these-violent-delights-dont-have-violent-ends-study-finds-no-link-between-violent-video-games-and-teen-aggression/&quot;&gt;with little or no impact&lt;/a&gt; on their behaviour. Future research may look into the correlation between sadistic urges and the likelihood of actually harming others.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/OAWeekCULogo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Cornell's OA Week Logo of an open lock&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-703 alignright&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/OAWeekCULogo-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;On October 19, arXiv hosted an #OAWeek panel discussion about open access in the COVID-19 era with arXiv executive director Eleonora Presani; John Inglis, co-founder of bioRxiv and medRxiv and executive director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; and Sebastian Kohlmeier, CORD-19 project manager and senior manager, Semantic Scholar, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. A recap of the event and a video are available below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2020/10/panel-offers-look-open-access-covid-19-era&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recap from the Cornell Chronicle, by Melanie Lefkowitz:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__items&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;field__item&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleonora Presani’s first day as executive director of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt; was March 16, 2020 – the same day much of New York state went into lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she was new to arXiv, the free and open scientific research database maintained and operated by Cornell, she realized immediately that some things would have to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Basically out of nowhere, we started to see more than 100 [coronavirus-related] papers per week,” Presani said during an Oct. 19 panel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHfuvUxmHx4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;“Rapid Response: How arXiv and Other Open-Access Resources Are Adapting to Research Community Needs During the Pandemic.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had to do something about it,” she said, “to make sure we could process them at the same service level we provide for our other papers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission of arXiv is to make scholarly research that has not yet been published freely available to researchers around the world. When COVID-19 struck, this mission became even more urgent, as scientists raced to learn more about the coronavirus and develop ways to control the pandemic. But it also highlighted the challenges faced by preprint servers, including arXiv, bioRxiv and medRxiv, in providing easy access to a huge volume of research that has not yet been peer-reviewed while minimizing the spread of potential misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_749&quot; style=&quot;width: 270px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHfuvUxmHx4&amp;amp;t&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image of arXiv Video Screenshot&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-749 size-full&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-22-at-9.49.53-AM.png&quot; width=&quot;270&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;To watch the panel discussion in its entirety, view it here.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With nearly 1.8 million articles in its collection, arXiv relies on a team of 185 volunteer moderators, supported by a small team of staff, to screen submitted papers. But since the majority of its content is in the fields of physics, mathematics and computer science, the organization needed to quickly escalate its expertise in COVID-related research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to creating a new searchable category for coronavirus articles, arXiv hired a Cornell postdoctoral researcher in biomedicine to help screen these articles for potentially misleading content. arXiv also has partnered with other organizations compiling open-access research, in order to make these articles more easily accessible and to speed the pace of discovery worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At bioRxiv and medRxiv – which saw huge spikes in submissions as COVID-19 spread – moderators soon realized they needed enhanced measures to combat the risk of harmful misinformation. When a paper posted in January claiming that inserts in coronavirus’ spike protein resembled protein sequences from HIV, technical issues with the paper provoked a storm of criticism that led to its withdrawal, said John Inglis, co-founder of bioRxiv and medRxiv, during the panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But we also noticed during that weekend that the paper had been picked up by conspiracy-oriented websites who were discussing the possibility that the virus had been human-engineered,” Inglis said. “We decided to put up an additional caveat about the use of preprints – a large yellow banner that reminded readers that these were preprints and, among other things, they should not be reported in the U.S. media as established information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sites, hosted by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, also put in place additional screening practices, including two-step scrutiny of every paper. The screeners are looking for issues such as plagiarism and assertions that could harm the public if they turn out to be wrong, Inglis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Part of this was an awareness of the fact that in all the furor about hydroxychloroquine, for example, the run on the drug was such that patients who really needed hydroxychloroquine were denied access to it,” he said. “We were very conscious of not wanting to add to that problem, or create another similar problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papers from arXiv, bioRxiv and medRxiv are among those included in CORD-19 (COVID-19 Open Research Dataset), a new dataset made available to leverage artificial intelligence to make a vast trove of coronavirus-related research more easily searchable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to take all the research about COVID-19 and coronavirus, going back all the way to the 1960s and 1970s when initial research about coronavirus started getting published, and make that available in a machine readable format,” said panelist Sebastian Kohlmeier, CORD-19 project manager and senior manager at Semantic Scholar, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, which created CORD-19 in partnership with other research groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When CORD-19 started in March, it contained 29,000 papers. It now has more than 280,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been absolutely incredible,” Kohlmeier said. “And one of the great driving forces behind making all the content available was a lot of the scientific publishers and preprint servers banded together to make COVID-19-related research open access, which was a very important component to making this research available to scientists who wanted to analyze the entire universe of coronavirus-related research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		<updated>2020-10-22T11:52:44+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A type of bone tool generally thought to have been invented by Stone Age humans got its start among hominids that lived hundreds of thousands of years before &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; evolved, a new study concludes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A set of 52 previously excavated but little-studied animal bones from East Africa’s Olduvai Gorge includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047248420301469&quot;&gt;the world’s oldest known barbed bone point&lt;/a&gt;, an implement probably crafted by now-extinct &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt; at least 800,000 years ago, researchers say. Made from a piece of a large animal’s rib, the artifact features three curved barbs and a carved tip, the team reports in the November &lt;em&gt;Journal of Human Evolution&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the Olduvai bones, biological anthropologist Michael Pante of Colorado State University in Fort Collins and colleagues identified five other tools from more than 800,000 years ago as probable choppers, hammering tools or hammering platforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/african-finds-revise-cultural-roots&quot;&gt;The previous oldest barbed bone points&lt;/a&gt; were from a central African site and dated to around 90,000 years ago (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/29/95&lt;/em&gt;), and were assumed to reflect a toolmaking ingenuity exclusive to &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;. Those implements include carved rings around the base of the tools where wooden shafts were presumably attached. Barbed bone points found at &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; sites were likely used to catch fish and perhaps to hunt large land prey.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The Olduvai Gorge barbed bone point, which had not been completed, shows no signs of having been attached to a handle or shaft. Ways in which &lt;em&gt;H. erectus &lt;/em&gt;used the implement are unclear, Pante and his colleagues say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This find and four of the other bone implements date to at least 800,000 years ago, based on their original positions below Olduvai sediment that records a known reversal of Earth’s magnetic field about 781,000 years ago. Another bone artifact dates to roughly 1.7 million years ago, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Olduvai point implicates &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt; as the inventor of barbed bone point technology,” Pante says, because stone tools previously excavated in the same Olduvai Gorge sediment resemble those that have been found at other African sites with &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt; fossils.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bone tools described in the new study come from a collection of animal bones excavated in the late 1960s and early 1970s by Mary Leakey before being stored among thousands of fossils and artifacts at an on-site Olduvai facility. Pante discovered the set of 52 bones in 2007 while doing research at Olduvai Gorge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, archaeologist Christian Tryon of the University of Connecticut in Storrs, who did not participate in the new study, questions whether the Olduvai bone specimen can be definitively classed as a barbed bone point because it wasn’t finished. But Pante’s report shows that Olduvai hominids, whether they were &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt; or some other prehuman population, carefully selected bones as well as stones for toolmaking, Tryon says. “They were expert craftsmen or women.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New York University archaeologist Justin Pargeter agrees. Although it’s unclear whether the Olduvai artifact was a pointed bone tool comparable to those later made by &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, he says, the existence of any bone toolmaking 800,000 years ago shows that this practice is far older than typically assumed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Along with bone toolmaking, a series of critical behavioral advances in hominids occurred before the emergence of &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; around 300,000 years ago. These developments include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-genus-earliest-stone-tool-artifacts-ethiopia-contested&quot;&gt;the invention of stone tools&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/3/19&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ashes-oldest-controlled-fire&quot;&gt;controlled fire use&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/2/12&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-homo-stone-tools-north-africa-arabia-early&quot;&gt;the ability to survive in new environments&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/29/18&lt;/em&gt;). Exploiting bone to make tools such as barbed points would have aided ancient &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; groups migrating through unfamiliar regions where locations of stone sources were unknown, Pante suspects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jewelry making, cave painting and other symbolic acts may represent “modern human behaviors” that eluded earlier hominids such as &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt;, Pante says. But some researchers suspect that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-ancestors-engraved-abstract-patterns&quot;&gt;now-extinct &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; species also created symbolic items &lt;/a&gt;(&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/3/14&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;An unforgiving environmental twist deserves at least some credit for the behavioral flexibility that has characterized the human species since our African origins around 300,000 years ago, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of thousands of years in parts of East Africa, food and water supplies remained fairly stable. But new evidence shows that starting about 400,000 years ago, hominids and other ancient animals in the region faced a harsh environmental reckoning, says a team led by paleoanthropologist Rick Potts of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The climate began to fluctuate dramatically. Faults caused by volcanic eruptions fractured the landscape and reduced the size of lakes. Large animals died out and were replaced by smaller creatures with more diverse diets. These changes heralded &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/43/eabc8975&quot;&gt;a series of booms and busts&lt;/a&gt; in the resources hominids needed to survive, Potts and his colleagues report October 21 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Around that time, hominids at a site called Olorgesailie in what’s now Kenya transformed their culture. That shift, between around 500,000 and 320,000 years ago, was probably influenced by increasingly unpredictable periods of water and food scarcity, the scientists contend.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Stone hand axes and other cutting tools made of local stone had dominated African toolkits for 700,000 years before that transition occurred. After that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-climate-shifts-may-have-sparked-human-ingenuity-and-networking&quot;&gt;Middle Stone Age tools, such as spearpoints&lt;/a&gt; made from rock imported from distant sources, gained popularity, Potts’ team has previously found (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/15/18&lt;/em&gt;). Middle Stone Age tools were smaller and more carefully crafted implements. Widely scattered hominid groups began to trade with one another to obtain suitable toolmaking rock and other resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Potts has long argued that Olorgesailie hominids evolved genetically and behaviorally to handle frequent climate shifts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/humanitys-imprecision-vision&quot;&gt;a process dubbed variability selection&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/12/97&lt;/em&gt;). But the new study indicates that ancient humans adapted to a number of environmental forces, not just climate fluctuations, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A cascade of ancient ecological changes led to alternating periods of resource abundance and scarcity, likely helping to make us the most adaptable [hominid] species that ever existed,” Potts says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Erosion at Olorgesailie has destroyed sediment layers dating to the Middle Stone Age transition. So the researchers hired a Kenyan company to drill as deeply as possible in the Koora basin, located about 24 kilometers south of Olorgesailie. Dating of the 139-meter-long extracted core found that the sediments spanned much of the last 1 million years, making it the best environmental record of that time period for anywhere in Africa, Potts says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;photographs of sediment cores&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3092499&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/102120_BB_ancient-enviro_inline_680.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3092499&quot;&gt;A segment of an East African sediment core (bottom) includes signatures of volcanic blasts, dry and rainy seasons, and changes in land cover (all shown in the top close-ups).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3092499&quot;&gt;Human Origins Program/Smithsonian, core image courtesy of LacCore/Univ. of Minnesota&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chemical and microscopic studies of the core revealed signs of volcanic eruptions having created faults that fragmented the Olorgesailie landscape starting roughly 400,000 years ago. Small ponds and lakes then replaced larger lake basins at a time when rainfall became inconsistent. Intermittent, increasingly frequent dry periods resulted in severe water shortages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vegetation changes followed. Shifts back and forth from grassy plains to forests denied large animals, such as elephants, regular access to former grazing areas. Faults in the landscape also reduced the size of any available grazing areas. As Potts’ team has previously found, smaller animals with diverse diets, including antelopes and pigs, became prominent at Olorgesailie during the Middle Stone Age. Stone tools at that time may have been tailored for hunting and processing smaller prey, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Booms and busts in resource availability during the Middle Stone Age each generally lasted for a few thousand years, based on evidence from the Koora sediment core, Potts says. That time resolution is a big improvement over previous studies that used global climate data to reconstruct ancient African environmental changes that occurred over tens of thousands of years, says archaeologist and paleoanthropologist Manuel Will of the University of Tübingen in Germany, who did not participate in the new investigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pott and colleagues’ findings “provide the best evidence yet for a link between environmental changes in East Africa and the spread of Middle Stone Age technology and increased mobility across the landscape,” says paleoanthropologist Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London. Although it’s still unclear where in Africa — as well as when and by whom — Middle Stone Age tools were invented, early humans would have found such implements invaluable for adapting to environmental disruptions, Stringer says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Olorgesailie’s Middle Stone Age boom-and-bust scenario may not apply to other parts of Africa where spearpoints and related implements didn’t appear until later, cautions archaeologist Lyn Wadley of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. In those settings, Middle Stone Age tools may have proven useful even for groups that enjoyed relatively stable water and food sources.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is a cosmic rock collector. Cheers erupted from mission control at 6:12 p.m. EDT on October 20 as scientists on Earth got word that the spacecraft had gently nudged a near-Earth asteroid called Bennu, and grabbed some of its rocks to return to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The spacecraft did everything it was supposed to do,” said mission principal investigator Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona in Tucson on October 20 on a NASA TV webcast. “I can’t believe we actually pulled this off.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OSIRIS-REx arrived at Bennu in December 2018, and spent almost two years making detailed maps of the 500-meter-wide asteroid’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-bennu-brittle-boulders-easier-sample-collection-nasa&quot;&gt;surface features and composition&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/8/20&lt;/em&gt;). Observations from Earth suggested Bennu should be smooth and sandy, but when OSIRIS-REx arrived, it found a treacherous, rocky landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team selected a relatively smooth patch in a crater named Nightingale. The spot was not without hazards, though — the team was so worried about a particularly large rock nearby that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-has-picked-osiris-rex-landing-site-asteroid-bennu&quot;&gt;they named it “Mount Doom”&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/12/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the spacecraft did not need to fully land in the crater to complete its mission. As it hovered just above the surface, OSIRIS-REx reached out a robotic arm with an instrument called TAGSAM at the end, for Touch-And-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism. The instrument tapped the asteroid lightly for six seconds, and released a burst of nitrogen gas to disturb the surface dust and pebbles. Once those small rocks were lofted, some hopefully were blown into the sample collector.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;OSIRIS-REx grabs a Bennu sample&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3092501&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/102120_LG_osiris-rex_inline.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3092501&quot;&gt;This gif is made from images that NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft took as it descended toward asteroid Bennu on October 20, tapped the asteroid to collect a sample of dust and small rocks, and lifted off again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3092501&quot;&gt;Goddard/NASA, University of Arizona&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team stayed up late analyzing the spacecraft’s pictures of the sampling sequence, Lauretta said in a news conference on October 21. Based on those images, it looks like the head of sampling device pushed down into the dust of Bennu’s surface a bit, perhaps a few centimeters. That’s good news, Lauretta said. In experiments performed on Earth, the spacecraft grabbed the most rock when the sampling head was surrounded by dust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also looks like the spacecraft destroyed a relatively large rock on its descent. “Literally, we crushed it,” Lauretta said. “That rock appears to fragment and shatter.” Studying the asteroid from orbit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-bennu-brittle-boulders-easier-sample-collection-nasa%5d&quot;&gt;suggested that type of smashing was possible&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/8/20&lt;/em&gt;), the team reported on October 8, and it was exciting to see it actually happen, Lauretta said in the news conference.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Because signals from Earth took 18½ minutes to reach Bennu, the spacecraft performed the sampling sequence autonomously. When the mission team got the signal that the spacecraft had finished its job and retreated to a safe distance from Bennu, team members pumped their arms in the air, cheered and sent each other socially distant high-fives and hugs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OSIRIS-REx is not the first spacecraft to grab samples from an asteroid. That distinction goes to Japan’s Hayabusa mission, which brought back &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/deleted-scenes/hayabusa-asteroid-sample-return-mission-lands-australia&quot;&gt;grains of asteroid Itokawa in 2010&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/14/10&lt;/em&gt;). An encore to that mission, Hayabusa2, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japan-hayabusa2-spacecraft-first-sample-asteroid-dust&quot;&gt;collected samples of asteroid Ryugu&lt;/a&gt; last year, and is on track to land in Australia in December (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/22/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But OSIRIS-REx attempted to collect much more material than Hayabusa2 did. Hayabusa2 hoped to collect 100 milligrams; OSIRIS-REx is aiming for a minimum of 60 grams, or a little more than two ounces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hayabusa2’s scientists have no way to know how much material it actually collected until the spacecraft returns to Earth. But OSIRIS-REx’s team plans to find out using the spacecraft itself. On October 22, the spacecraft will turn its arm so that its cameras can take a picture of the inside of the TAGSAM collector and see if any dust and small rocks are there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then a few days later, the spacecraft will extend its arm and spin its whole body. The difference in the way it spins after the sample collection, versus before, will reveal the mass of the sample. The team expects to report that mass on October 26.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If OSIRIS-REx goes back to Bennu for a second sample, it won’t return to Nightingale crater, said project manager Rich Burns of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., at the October 21 news conference. Any second attempt would touch down in a backup site called Osprey, and would happen in January.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OSIRIS-REx will return to Earth in 2023, where scientists will analyze the rocks in hopes of unlocking details of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-sample-missions-hayabusa2-ryugu-osiris-rex-bennu&quot;&gt;history of the solar system&lt;/a&gt; and the origins of water and life on Earth (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/15/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/21/people-from-japan-may-be-less-prone-than-americans-to-some-of-the-harmful-health-related-effects-of-negative-emotions/"/>

		<updated>2020-10-21T15:21:54+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s your view on feelings of sadness, nervousness or hopelessness? Are they harmful emotions that we should strive to avoid feeling — an opinion that is widely held in the West? Or is natural, even helpful, to feel them from time to time — a perspective commonly found in Japan?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have found that cultural attitudes to our emotions affect our health. In Japan, for example, greater reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/09/22/cross-cultural-correction-for-people-in-japan-happiness-isnt-associated-with-better-health/&quot;&gt;happiness isn’t associated with better health&lt;/a&gt;, in contrast to findings from the US. Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/08/there-are-some-intriguing-differences-between-the-usa-and-japan-in-how-emotions-influence-health/&quot;&gt;regular experience of high-energy, high-arousal states is associated with better health in the US, but not Japan&lt;/a&gt;, where calm, quiet states are highly valued. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-21761-001&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt; reveals that our attitudes to negative emotions, such as sadness and hopelessness, matter, too. Previous studies have linked experience of these emotions to increased inflammation and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and even death among Americans, but not Japanese people. So Jiyoung Park at the University of Texas at Dallas and her colleagues set out to explore whether differences in stress might explain this. If, in contrast to Japanese people, Americans view the experience of negative emotions as a failure of self-control, and feel stress as a result, this could explain the links between these kinds of emotions and poorer health. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40593&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The team analysed detailed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.midus.wisc.edu&quot;&gt;data collected on 761 Americans&lt;/a&gt; of European descent and &lt;a href=&quot;http://midus.wisc.edu/midja/index.php&quot;&gt;328 Japanese adults&lt;/a&gt;, with a mean age of about 60. As part of much bigger studies, these participants had all completed surveys to assess negative emotions (how often, and how severely, they felt them) and personality. They had also given a series of saliva samples, which had been analysed for levels of the stress hormone cortisol, and blood samples, which had been checked for certain markers of inflammation as well as cholesterol levels (which can indicate risk for cardiovascular disease). Their blood pressure had also been checked. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Healthy people show a big spike in cortisol shortly after waking, then a gradual decline in levels of this hormone during the day. Regular stress alters this pattern, blunting that early spike and making the decline less steep — a profile known to be associated with poorer health. When the team analysed the data, they found that experience of negative emotions was indeed associated with a flattening of the daily cortisol slope among the Americans, but not among the Japanese participants. (The team took all kinds of other factors into account when performing the analysis, including personality traits known to influence the reporting of negative emotions, gender, age, sleep patterns and more.) This was the case even though the Japanese participants in fact reported more negative emotions than the Americans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Park and her colleagues also found that for the Americans, but not the Japanese participants, experience of negative emotions was associated with both more inflammation and higher cardiovascular risk indicators. Their analysis led them to conclude that this was due to the flattening of the cortisol slope among only the Americans. “These findings suggest that cultural differences in how emotions are construed may make the experience of negative affect more or less stressful and differentially consequential for health,” the team writes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Japanese participants appeared to be “buffered against some of the harmful health consequences of negative affect because of their view of negative affect as a fluctuating, momentary part of a natural cycle of both the self and external events, and thus not threatening or stressful.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the researchers themselves note, there are, however, a few reasons to be cautious about drawing very strong conclusions from this data. The links that they report are all correlational, and longitudinal studies will be needed to look at variations in negative emotion, cortisol profile and health over time. Also, it’s possible that something other than differences in attitudes to negative emotion — differences in emotion regulation abilities, perhaps — are behind the different findings for Americans versus Japanese people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the research does add to a growing body of evidence that our &lt;em&gt;attitudes&lt;/em&gt; to our emotions are key to understanding how they affect our long-term health. It could be tricky to change the view, widespread in the West, of negative emotions as being undesirable, even dangerous. But this work, in the context of other recent supporting studies, certainly suggests that it is worth trying to do this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-21761-001&quot;&gt;Feeling bad is not always unhealthy: Culture moderates the link between negative affect and diurnal cortisol profiles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2020-10-21T15:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The diabolical ironclad beetle is like a tiny tank on six legs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This insect’s rugged exoskeleton is so tough that the beetle can survive getting run over by cars, and many would-be predators don’t stand a chance of cracking one open. &lt;em&gt;Phloeodes diabolicus&lt;/em&gt; is basically nature’s jawbreaker.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Analyses of microscope images, 3-D printed models and computer simulations of the beetle’s armor have now revealed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2813-8&quot;&gt;the secrets to its strength&lt;/a&gt;. Tightly interlocked and impact-absorbing structures that connect pieces of the beetle’s exoskeleton help it survive enormous crushing forces, researchers report in the Oct. 22 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. Those features could inspire new, sturdier designs for things such as body armor, buildings, bridges and vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The diabolical ironclad beetle, which dwells in desert regions of western North America, has a distinctly hard-to-squish shape. “Unlike a stink beetle, or a Namibian beetle, which is more rounded … it’s low to the ground [and] it’s flat on top,” says David Kisailus, a materials scientist at the University of California, Irvine. In compression experiments, Kisailus and colleagues found that the beetle could withstand around 39,000 times its own body weight. That would be like a person shouldering a stack of about 40 M1 Abrams battle tanks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within the diabolical ironclad beetle’s own tanklike physique, two key microscopic features help it withstand crushing forces. The first is a series of connections between the top and bottom halves of the exoskeleton. “You can imagine the beetle’s exoskeleton almost like two halves of a clamshell sitting on top of each other,” Kisailus says. Ridges along the outer edges of the top and bottom latch together.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;cross-section of a diabolical ironclad beetle’s back&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3092486&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/102020_mt_ironclad-beetle_inline_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3092486&quot;&gt;This slice of a diabolical ironclad beetle’s back shows the jigsaw-shaped links that connect the left and right sides of its exoskeleton. These protrusions are tightly interlocked and highly damage-resistant, helping give the beetle its incredible durability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3092486&quot;&gt;David Kisailus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But those ridged connections have different shapes across the beetle’s body. Near the front of the beetle, around its vital organs, the ridges are highly interconnected — almost like zipper teeth. Those connections are stiff and resist bending under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The connective ridges near the back of the beetle, on the other hand, are not as intricately interlocked, allowing the top and bottom halves of the exoskeleton to slide past each other slightly. That flexibility helps the beetle absorb compression in a region of its body that is safer to squish.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The second key feature is a rigid joint, or suture, that runs the length of the beetle’s back and connects its left and right sides. A series of protrusions, called blades, fit together like jigsaw puzzle pieces to join the two sides. These blades contain layers of tissue glued together by proteins, and are highly damage-resistant. When the beetle is squashed, tiny cracks form in the protein glue between the layers of each blade. Those small, healable fractures allow the blades to absorb impacts without completely snapping, explains Jesus Rivera, an engineer at UC Irvine.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This toughness makes the diabolical ironclad beetle pretty predator-proof. An animal might be able to make a meal out of the beetle by swallowing it whole, Kisailus says. “But the way it’s built, in terms of other predation — let’s say like a bird that’s pecking at it, or a lizard that’s trying to chew on it — the exoskeleton would be really hard” to crack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That hard exterior is also a nuisance for insect collectors. The diabolical ironclad beetle is notorious among entomologists for being so fantastically durable that it bends the steel pins usually used to mount insects for display, says entomologist Michael Caterino of Clemson University in South Carolina. But “the basic biology of this thing is not particularly well-known,” he says. “I found it fascinating” to learn what makes the beetle so indestructible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The possibility of using beetle-inspired designs for sturdier airplanes and other structures is intriguing, Caterino adds. And with the splendid variety of insects all over the world, who knows what other critters might someday inspire clever engineering designs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Syphilis and gonorrhea incidence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2019/2018-STD-surveillance-report.html&quot;&gt;have increased enormously&lt;/a&gt; in recent decades, necessitating innovative approaches. The rising prevalence of syphilis and gonorrhea, together with the increase in prevalence of resistant gonorrhea, makes contact tracing an important tool for disease control. In connection with the opioid epidemic, syphilis is now common in rural areas. However, people infected with stigmatized diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea may be reluctant to reveal all of their sexual contacts. Reasons for not revealing all contacts may include internalized stigma, cognitive dissonance, or beliefs that certain types of sexual contacts do not “count.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking for friends might identify more sexually transmitted infection (STI) cases because friends may participate within the same sexual network, or some friends might be non-romantic sexual partners. One survey even found 77% of Grindr users report looking for friendship, more than the percentage seeking dating (67%), one-on-one sex (62%), or group sex (17%).&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/feed/#_edn1&quot; name=&quot;_ednref1&quot;&gt;[i]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09589-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who were diagnosed with syphilis and gonorrhea in Baltimore City STI clinics were asked to name the most important people in their lives, with questions such as whom they eat meals with, who would take them to medical appointments, who would go to the store for them, or lend them $25. After patients named their friends and social contacts, they were asked to name their sexual contacts. Both social and sexual contacts were invited to the STI clinic for testing, and to name their own social and sexual contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this information for patients whose contacts visited the STI clinic, we created a network showing the friendship and sexual contacts and the STI test results.  We identified new cases of both syphilis and gonorrhea within each network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12132&quot; style=&quot;width: 307px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12132 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/Figure-1-297x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;297&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;New cases of syphilis&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Figure 1, the network shows new cases of syphilis identified by asking for social contacts in the large red squares.The small squares are males, and circles are females. Shapes colored red are the participants who tested positive for syphilis. The green arrows are social network connections and the black are sexual network connections. Biological strain analysis for the organism that causes syphilis (&lt;em&gt;T. pallidum&lt;/em&gt;) found that the disease strains matched across connected individuals, suggesting that individuals were connected within the same sexual network, although not necessarily directly: the friends may have had sex together or have a sex partner in common that does not appear in the graph. It’s remarkable here that for many pairs where both were infected with syphilis (syphilis-concordant dyads, for short), no sexual partners appear in the graph, and in a few cases both are male.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12133&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12133&quot; height=&quot;297&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/Figure-2-300x297.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;New cases of gonorrhea&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did the same for gonorrhea.  As before, new cases of gonorrhea identified by asking for social contacts are the large red squares. The small squares are males, and circles are females. Shapes colored red are the participants who tested positive for gonorrhea. The green arrows are social network connections and the black are sexual network connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additional cases of syphilis and gonorrhea identified by asking friendship ties suggest that they under-reported their sexual contacts. These friendship ties may actually be sexual ties that were not reported as sexual; many of these ties were same-sex, and same-sex ties were stigmatized in this community, especially at the time that the data were collected (2001-05). Alternatively, these friendship ties may represent participation in the same sexual networks, such as engaging in a sexual relationship with the same person or people, who were not observed in the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning from COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given existing strains on public health resources, public health policy must be creative. Traditionally, contact tracing is done by Disease Intervention Specialists. However, the 2008 recession resulted in large cuts to public health agencies that were never reversed. The Disease Intervention Specialists currently do not have enough resources even to contact all sexual contacts of index cases of syphilis and gonorrhea, so they prioritize vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women. Public health agencies simply do not have resources to contact the friends of index cases, and index cases may not cooperate anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, large technology companies have created privacy-preserving innovations in SARS-coronavirus-2 contact tracing &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid19.apple.com/contacttracing&quot;&gt;protocols&lt;/a&gt; that have been deployed in state health department contact tracing apps. These contact tracing protocols identify nearby phones using Bluetooth and approximate the distance and duration. Public health authorities create COVID-19 contact tracing apps using these protocols that can specify distance and time duration for potential coronavirus contacts. These protocols or health department apps could be extended to contact tracing for other diseases. Changing the parameters for distance and duration on public health contact tracing apps could identify potential sexual contacts, allowing these apps to be used for STI contact tracing. The transition to these COVID-19 contact tracing apps has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/why-contact-tracing-apps-not-slowed-covid-us/&quot;&gt;bumpy&lt;/a&gt;, with technological limitations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2020/07/how-to-get-people-to-actually-use-contact-tracing-apps&quot;&gt;low uptake&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://devops.com/more-than-half-of-americans-willing-to-participate-in-contact-tracing-but-have-major-privacy-concerns/&quot;&gt;lack of public trust&lt;/a&gt;, especially in government. The Bluetooth distance detection doesn’t do well &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/devices/contact-tracing-apps-struggle-to-be-both-effective-and-private&quot;&gt;near shiny surfaces or in public transit buses or trains&lt;/a&gt;, and while that’s a large problem for COVID-19 contact tracing, it’s not a problem for STIs. As with many US problems, low public trust in government is the limiting factor for contact tracing, whether traditional or by app.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Naked mole-rats — with their subterranean societies made up of a single breeding pair and an army of workers — seem like mammals trying their hardest to live like insects. Nearly 300 of the bald, bucktoothed, nearly blind rodents can scoot along a colony’s labyrinth of tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New research suggests there’s brute power in those numbers: Like ants or termites, the mole-rats go to battle with rival colonies to conquer their lands. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wild naked mole-rats (&lt;em&gt;Heterocephalus glaber&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1111/jzo.12834&quot;&gt;will invade nearby colonies to expand their territory&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes abducting pups to incorporate them into their own ranks, researchers report September 28 in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Zoology&lt;/em&gt;. This behavior may put smaller, less cohesive colonies at a disadvantage, potentially supporting the evolution of bigger colonies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers stumbled across this phenomenon by accident while monitoring naked mole-rat colonies in Kenya’s Meru National Park. The team was studying the social structure of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/naked-and-not&quot;&gt;extreme form of group living among mammals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(SN: 6/20/06)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Over more than a decade, the team trapped and marked thousands of mole-rats from dozens of colonies by either implanting small radio-frequency transponder chips under their skin, or clipping their toes. One day in 1994, while marking mole-rats in a new colony, researchers were surprised to find in its tunnels mole-rats from a neighboring colony that had already been marked. The queen in the new colony had wounds on her face from the ravages of battle. It looked like a war was playing out down in the soil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Naked mole-rats are better known for their cooperation within colonies than competition between colonies,” notes Stan Braude, a biologist at Washington University in St. Louis. But over the course of the long-term study, Braude and his colleagues found that 26 colonies expanded their tunnels by digging into burrow systems occupied by neighboring colonies. In half of these cases, the invaded colony fled to a different arm of their tunnel system as the invaders expanded their territory. In the other half of cases, the invaded colony was entirely displaced, and the original mole-rats were never encountered there again. In four incursions, researchers caught invading mole-rats in the act, and in three of those, the bigger colony was doing the invading. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Genetic analysis, which was not available during the original research, later confirmed that during the 1994 invasion, the aggressors didn’t just evict the vanquished. They also pup-napped at least two youngsters. The pups grew up to become workers within their captors’ society.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This lust for conquest had been seen before in the species, but only in captive colonies. Confirmation that these conflicts happen naturally in the wild means that they may have some influence on the evolution of the mole-rats’ crowded social lives, Braude says. The total eviction of smaller colonies by larger ones presents a previously unconsidered factor that makes it “important for this species to live in as large a group as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nothing about these “crazy beasts” surprises evolutionary biologist Chris Faulkes anymore. “The burrow is a massively valuable resource because it is so costly — in terms of energy — to excavate and build,” says Faulkes, of Queen Mary University of London. It makes sense that mole-rats would not only defend it, but try to pilfer this resource from others. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since group size is so important to naked mole-rats, Faulkes says it’s interesting that workers from the different colonies don’t join together after an invasion. Only pups are added to the invading colony. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The numbers of these kidnapped pups is really rather small, and these incidences of kidnapping may not be that frequent,” he says. “Given that, I’m not sure how much that really contributes to building large colony numbers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers argue that since there’s such a narrow window of time after birth when a mole-rat can be stolen, the fact that these pup-nappings were documented at all may mean the behavior is fairly common.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other forces may also be at play in facilitating the rise of large, tight-knit mole-rat colonies, like the spotty distribution of food resources in their harsh, dry habitat. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Staying safe and finding food are absolutely important,” agrees Braude. Invasions might even abet that, contributing to the success of a mole-rat society. For instance, inhabiting a larger tunnel system may mean more access to the nutritious tubers the mole-rats find and feed upon underground.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Warfare isn’t the only strategy naked mole-rats have to boost their colony’s geographic and genetic influence. Some naked mole-rats are specially equipped with abundant fat reserves that allow them to journey long distances aboveground. These “&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/11/1/7/239154&quot;&gt;dispersal morph&lt;/a&gt;” individuals interbreed with other colonies’ members and can potentially establish brand new colonies. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a non-profit, mission-driven organization PLOS abides by our commitment to transparency. We &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/financial-overview/&quot;&gt;openly share&lt;/a&gt; information and context about our finances, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot;&gt;target revenue amounts&lt;/a&gt; in some of our emerging business models. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/price-and-service-transparency-frameworks/&quot;&gt;Plan S Price &amp;amp; Service Transparency Framework&lt;/a&gt; provided us — and other publishers — a clear, uniform structure to share information about the services we perform and a percentage breakdown of how these are covered by the prices we charge. Many of our mission-driven publishing activities go well beyond peer review and production services. We provide commentary on some of these services, including how the varied editorial setups of our journals contribute to different percentage price breakdowns per title. We encourage other publishers to be transparent and openly share their data via such frameworks. And, we remain confident in showcasing how our prices cover our reasonable costs for a high level of service, with some margin for reinvestment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Post&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since our founding in 2001, PLOS has maintained a firm commitment to transparency. Transparency informs our work within communities. It drives our approach to open science practices &amp;amp; policies. And it underpins our willingness to share financial data. Here are three examples of our commitment in action:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every year we provide financial transparency via the publication and contextualization of our IRS filings (&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/financial-overview/&quot;&gt;2018 financial overview available here; &lt;/a&gt;our 2019 overview will be available in November)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We participate in broader efforts within the publishing community to encourage greater understanding around pricing and the costs of Open Access publishing (see immediately below for the Plan S example)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our new collective action business model for &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology — &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot;&gt;Community Action Publishing&lt;/a&gt; — openly shares how much revenue is required for PLOS to run these specific journals. We will redistribute revenues beyond the target back to community members&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, we are especially grateful to cOAlition S for spurring the scholarly publishing community, broadly, to engage with transparency via its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/price-and-service-transparency-frameworks/&quot;&gt;Plan S Price &amp;amp; Service Transparency Framework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Response to Plan S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In early 2020, PLOS (together with nine other publishers&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.informationpower.co.uk/launch-of-the-plan-s-price-transparency-framework/&quot;&gt;piloted &lt;/a&gt;one of the two approved pricing transparency frameworks for cOAlition S. We are now &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16_3Eoxp3_C_xwontOJvLah45YC7Wgg032pGRsa2G_14/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;sharing the figures PLOS provided&lt;/a&gt; as part of this initiative to provide context to our own pricing and to further promote this kind of transparency broadly within the community. We encourage other publishers to be transparent and openly share their data as well. (Please see the post on price transparency by our friends at &lt;strong&gt;F1000 Research&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.f1000.com/2020/08/19/price-transparency-on-f1000research/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before diving into discussion of figures, we want to restate two underlying principles.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS does not charge for any activity for the sole purpose of profit. We do not seek or need revenue surplus for return to shareholders, but rather to support and reinvest in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/&quot;&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our organizational activities are developed to meet the needs of researchers, our prices cover our reasonable costs for our high level of service plus some margin for reinvestment, and our drives for efficiency are to enable as good an author experience as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Plan S Price &amp;amp; Service Transparency framework invited publishers to divide Article Processing Charge, per journal, into seven categories of activity&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journal and community development&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;efforts&lt;/strong&gt;, including commissioning content, researching editorial board members, and scope development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submission to desk reject or acceptance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peer review management &lt;/strong&gt;by staff/remunerated people, including management of submissions that are ultimately rejected&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceptance to publication&lt;/strong&gt;, including typesetting, conversation, and production tasks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services after publication&lt;/strong&gt;, including ethics checks and queries, usage statistics, long-term preservation and access monitoring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales &amp;amp; marketing&lt;/strong&gt; to customers or of articles, including marketing campaigns&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author and customer support,&lt;/strong&gt; including queries about licensing, citations, and author system troubleshooting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS’ pricing breakdown (which is only one element of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16_3Eoxp3_C_xwontOJvLah45YC7Wgg032pGRsa2G_14/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;data captured in the spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;) for 2019 is presented in the table below.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-table&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;APC price&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,350&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,350&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,350&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,350&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$3,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$3,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1,595&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price for journal and community development&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;18%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price from submission to desk reject or accept&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;25%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;27%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;21%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price for peer review management&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;21%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;23%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price for services from acceptance to publication&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;22%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;21%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;21%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;21%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price for services after publication&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price for sales &amp;amp; marketing to customers or of articles&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price for author and customer support&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The above is a relatively good way of illustrating the breadth of activities that occur at PLOS, and which our income supports. However, like any framework or metric, it strips away some of the detail and nuance so we wanted to provide some overarching commentary and highlight a few observations.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Varied Editorial structures drive varied price allocation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently, PLOS has two types of editorial setup across our seven journals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; are supported by senior &lt;strong&gt;in-house&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;editorial teams&lt;/strong&gt; (including Editors-in-Chief, an Executive Editor, Senior Editors, and Associate Editors) working in conjunction with external editorial boards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt; each have &lt;strong&gt;external &lt;/strong&gt;Editors-in-Chief and Associate Editors (who are full time members of the research, medical, health, and/or academic communities).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The in-house editorial teams (a.k.a. Staff Editors) comprise salaried PLOS employees and are editorially independent. We see this combined expertise of dedicated Staff Editors and leading scientists in the field as an important aspect of the publication process for these titles. Our Staff Editors work to guide researchers through submission and peer review. They also partner with our external Academic Editors, experts in the field, to provide guidance. This unique editorial model ensures expertise, fairness and efficiency for each manuscript. This internal and external resourcing structure is reflected in the greater price share for activities related to “initial triage” and “peer review management” for these particular titles. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond editorial and production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 43% – 61% of our journals’ price covers the editorial/production work of receiving submissions, coordinating their peer review, and production and online publication of accepted articles. The remainder of the price covers the broader and deeper work of services before and after the publication process, including marketing, author support, and ethics checks, among other things — each of which is critically important. As examples:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS has a highly regarded &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/staff-editors#loc-publication-ethics&quot;&gt;publishing ethics team&lt;/a&gt; that handles all  ethical and scientific concerns involving submissions and published articles. It also works to raise awareness of publication ethics standards, develops policies and processes to address integrity issues (at scale) prior to publication, and participates in broader discussions about publication ethics policies and practices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS engages closely with research communities (e.g. by attending/organizing conferences/events/workshops, these days mostly online) to ensure the journals and their policies truly reflect the research interests and values of these fields and communities. We operate in both global and local contexts, therefore it is ever more important to ensure we reflect the values of the diverse communities of researchers whom we publish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS has a dedicated, proactive &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/media/&quot;&gt;media team&lt;/a&gt; that collaborates with authors, institutions, science media centers and journalists to communicate research to both scientists and society. Consequently, articles published in our journals receive great attention in the media. The team also develops policies and participates in industry conversations about best practices (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/05/preprints-and-the-media-a-change-to-how-plos-handles-press-for-papers-previously-posted-as-preprints/&quot;&gt;preprints and the media&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS’ Outreach team promotes articles, invites submissions, promotes initiatives like calls for papers, and has also created widely used and well-regarded resources such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-reviewers/&quot;&gt;Peer Review Center&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/writing-center/&quot;&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS pilots, develops, and leads the way in &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/&quot;&gt;Open Science practices&lt;/a&gt;, from creating new software to be able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/&quot;&gt;publish peer review histories at scale&lt;/a&gt;, to patiently cultivating trust in science via a rigorous approach to &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/transparency-and-trust-peer-review-week-2020/&quot;&gt;preprints and preprint commenting&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS is &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/&quot;&gt;constantly working&lt;/a&gt; to make Open Access easier, more efficient, and fair for researchers from all demographics, geographies, and disciplines. This is both via &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot;&gt;new business model&lt;/a&gt; development, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Open-Access-RFI-Comments-Reduced-5.pdf&quot;&gt;policy engagement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We hope the full data and above commentary can give you some new insights. At PLOS we are proud of what we do. It is our privilege to devote our time and energy towards such crucial matters as increasing trust in science. We will always do this in partnership with the research community. And, perhaps, there has never been a more important time to be doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cheating is common, ranging from benign instances like looking up an answer on your phone during a pub quiz, to the fairly major, such as using a series of coughs to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBWR0I9LbOQ&quot;&gt;fraudulently bag yourself a million pounds &lt;/a&gt;on a popular TV game show. But wherever we fall on that scale, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10463280802613866&quot;&gt;research suggests&lt;/a&gt;, we’re still likely to think of ourselves as honest and trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s something of a tension here — we’re seemingly both prone to cheating &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; convinced of our own integrity. Matthew L. Stanley and colleagues from Duke University have one explanation for this apparent contradiction &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-020-01812-w&quot;&gt;in their latest paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Psychonomic Bulletin &amp;amp; Review&lt;/em&gt;: when we cheat, we claim we knew the answers all along.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40582&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Before the start of the study proper, the team conducted a pilot test with 95 participants, who were shown 24 general knowledge questions; half were easy (“how many legs does a spider have?”) while the other half were more difficult (“Which nation was the first to ratify the United Nations charter in 1945?”). No participants correctly answered any of the 12 difficult questions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 147 participants saw these 24 questions and had to type in the answers. Before answering, they were told the correct answer would be visible to them, upside down in a small font on the bottom right of their screens. Looking at the answer, they were told, as well as looking things up online, was considered cheating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After a short unrelated task, participants were shown the same questions, this time with the answers included. They then indicated whether or not they had known the answer to the question before the beginning of the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These participants fared better than those in the pilot: they correctly answered 14% of the difficult questions. Given that nobody in the pilot group correctly answered these questions, this suggests that participants were cheating. And when they answered these difficult questions correctly, participants were also more likely to report that they knew the answer all along. That is, even though they likely cheated, they claimed to have known the answer anyway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a second study, participants were assigned to one of two conditions. The first — the cheating condition — replicated the initial study: participants were shown the correct answers on the bottom right hand of their screen. In the control condition, participants had no opportunity to cheat, but were shown the correct solution immediately after answering each question.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, those in the cheating condition answered more of the difficult questions than those in the control condition — and were more likely to later report that they knew the answers all along too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the final study, all 412 participants were able to see the answer on their screen — only this time, those in the control condition were told they could look at the answer if they didn’t know it themselves. As in the previous two studies, those in the cheating condition were subsequently more likely to indicate that they knew the answer all along, suggesting yet again a link between perceived (or claimed) knowledge and cheating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings fit into a wider body of research that suggests we’re liable to lie to ourselves about who we are or how we behave. We &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/113/22/6166&quot;&gt;distance ourselves&lt;/a&gt; from past mistakes or &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/45/1/185/4711097?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;forget them&lt;/a&gt; altogether, and see ourselves as &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-018-0880-y&quot;&gt;increasingly moral&lt;/a&gt; over time. What the study doesn’t explain is how people are experiencing these mistakes themselves. Are they just lying about having known the answer, fully aware that they’re not telling the truth? Or is there a level of &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt;-deception: do people truly believing that they had the solution all along?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also poses interesting questions about how to prevent cheating. If we’re able to believe we’re honest and trustworthy literally immediately after engaging in duplicitous behaviour, making appeals to morality might not work: people might simply think &lt;em&gt;“I &lt;/em&gt;would never do something like that!” Techniques that completely foreclose the possibility of cheating may have more mileage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-020-01812-w&quot;&gt;Cheaters claim they knew the answers all along&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Things are heating up at the seafloor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thermometers moored at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean &lt;a href=&quot;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL089093&quot;&gt;recorded an average temperature increase of about 0.02 degrees Celsius&lt;/a&gt; over the last decade, researchers report in the Sept. 28 &lt;em&gt;Geophysical Research Letters&lt;/em&gt;. That warming may be a consequence of human-driven climate change, which has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-how-climate-change-already-altering-oceans-ice-future&quot;&gt;boosted ocean temperatures&lt;/a&gt; near the surface (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/25/19&lt;/em&gt;), but it’s unclear since so little is known about the deepest, darkest parts of the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The deep ocean, below about 2,000 meters, is not very well observed,” says Chris Meinen, an oceanographer at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Miami. The deep sea is so hard to reach that the temperature at any given research site is typically taken only once per decade. But Meinen’s team measured temperatures hourly from 2009 to 2019 using seafloor sensors at four spots in the Argentine Basin, off the coast of Uruguay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Temperature records for the two deepest spots revealed a clear trend of warming over that decade. Waters 4,540 meters below the surface warmed from an average 0.209° C to 0.234° C, while waters 4,757 meters down went from about 0.232°C to 0.248°C. This warming is much weaker than in the upper ocean, Meinen says, but he also notes that since warm water rises, it would take a lot of heat to generate even this little bit of warming so deep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s too soon to judge whether human activity or natural variation is the cause, Meinen says. Continuing to monitor these sites and comparing the records with data from devices in other ocean basins may help to clarify matters.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The threat of death is no obstacle for some hungry fire ants. To escape drowning while feeding on sugary water, black imported fire ants built syphons out of sand that moved the water to a safer spot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A range of animals, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stick-toting-puffins-offer-first-evidence-tool-use-seabirds&quot;&gt;birds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dolphins-learn-shells-foraging-tools&quot;&gt;dolphins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/capuchin-monkey-stone-tool-use-evolution-3000-years&quot;&gt;primates&lt;/a&gt; and even ants, use objects as tools (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/30/19&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;SN: 6/25/20&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;SN: 6/24/19&lt;/em&gt;). Ants often employ debris or sand grains to carry food. But this is the first time that the insects have been observed &lt;a href=&quot;https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.13671&quot;&gt;adjusting their tool use to build relatively complex structures&lt;/a&gt; in response to a problem, researchers report October 7 in &lt;em&gt;Functional Ecology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the wild, black imported fire ants (&lt;em&gt;Solenopsis richteri&lt;/em&gt;) typically eat honeydew produced by aphids. In the lab, entomologist Jian Chen of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service in Stoneville, Miss., and colleagues provided the ants with containers of sugary water. The insects have a hard, water-repellent outer covering called a cuticle, and can typically float on a liquid — and sure enough, the insects floated and fed without a problem.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;The researchers then reduced the water’s surface tension with a surfactant to make it more difficult for the ants to float. While some ants drowned, most stopped entering the containers and instead used grains of sand placed nearby to build structures leading from the inside of a container to outside of it. Those structures acted like syphons. Within five minutes of building one, nearly half of the water was drawn out through the sand pathway, allowing the ants to feed safely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The fact that ants are building little syphons is new and interesting,” says Valerie Banschbach of Gustavus Adolphus College in Saint Peter, Minn., who was not involved in the study. The insects’ “flexibility to act in a creative way responding to a situation suggests that they have higher cognitive abilities than what is traditionally believed.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;In this time-lapse video, watch how most black imported fire ants avoid drowning by using grains of sand to build relatively sophisticated structures around containers of sugar water&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; In experiments, it took the ants more than 90 minutes to shift the sand to the containers and do the construction work. Those structures act as syphons to draw the water out of the containers and to a safer place for the ants to feed. &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How the insects were able to sense the change in the water’s surface tension is unknown. Some ants that drown initially could be releasing chemical messengers, Chen says, or maybe the ants taste a difference in the water, or a combination of both.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Black imported fire ants are native to South America but have made their way to parts of North America where they are regarded as invasive. The insects can damage crops such as corn, soybeans and okra, and can also sting humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A major goal of the project, Chen says, is to develop new pest control measures by better understanding how the ants may behave in their natural habitat. Different types of surfactants are often added to pesticides to help them spread better, the researchers say, so ants could potentially be exposed to similar conditions in the wild as they were in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, Chen is content to marvel at the industrious insects. “Ants are so amazing,” he says. “We have just scratched the surface of the ant world.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/skoQOMC8LYE/"/>
		<id>https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18477</id>
		<updated>2020-10-19T16:34:02+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;It’s the start of Open Access Week 2020 and this year’s theme focuses on “Open with Purpose” with equity and inclusivity as the focal point for the third consecutive year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are we still talking about this?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this time, the need for international collaboration and access without restrictions is acutely apparent with COVID-19 pausing regular activities, such as conferences, libraries and other in person events. Building equity and inclusivity will create a stronger environment for scientists to ask questions or see problems from a different perspective. It’s also integral for organizations to reflect on what they can do to help researchers from every background get their research to the communities that need it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking to an inclusive future&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;OA helps break down many of the barriers researchers face by sharing their findings to a vast readership. Yet, a number of hurdles still stand between them and the final article. At PLOS, we support researchers at every stage of their career, research and discipline. Open Science further increases transparency and visibility of their work so that all researchers can more easily be recognized for their contributions. With a host of journals and a variety of article types and early sharing methods such as preprints and preregistered reports — researchers will have the opportunity to showcase the full breadth of their findings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We recognize that as an organization we can do much more to assist those in the scientific community that experience challenges due to their gender, race, culture and more. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/07/our-commitment-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/&quot;&gt;blog post by Editorial Director Joerg Heber&lt;/a&gt;, he outlines our support for a diverse and inclusive community and the areas we’ll continue to improve on to recognize and minimize bias, further diversify our leadership and contributors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be counted for your work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OA provides the community with the accessibility to your research to see, cite, and share it. Your research and contributions in the community are vital to scientific advancements. Be proud, in whatever stage of your career, of what you’ve achieved and get the recognition for your contributions, be that through your ORCID iD or citations. The OA community is increasingly adapting to the needs of ECRs. Transparency and early sharing practices for every stage of the research process are becoming increasingly common to support researchers in demonstrating their contributions, beyond just publications. Be the first to report your findings with &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/&quot;&gt;preprints&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/&quot;&gt;preregistration&lt;/a&gt;, just two ways in which you can highlight your progress early when you’re applying for funding and new positions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS is always searching for new ways we can make publishing and acknowledging your work easier. Whether that means building a more inclusive framework to ensure credit is shared equitably among contributors, or supporting researchers in making their work more visible.  In a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/implementing-name-changes-for-published-transgender-authors/&quot;&gt;policy announced last week&lt;/a&gt;, we’re providing better support to transgender authors with live articles published under names that do not reflect their identity. Our staff will be happy to help update your records and help you keep your previous credits. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote is-style-default&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publishing an academic study is an achievement for researchers to be proud of, and it is important that the name on the paper reflects who the authors are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;— &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/implementing-name-changes-for-published-transgender-authors/&quot;&gt;Implementing name changes for published transgender authors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Access is more important than ever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a time where COVID-19 proves to be a challenging obstacle with restrictions to labs and libraries, it is integral that we’re inclusive of the many groups in the scientific community — researchers around the world need access to content anywhere, anytime. OA is the key to providing fast, public access to research with no restrictions or embargoes. The global benefit of open research is powerful and will help maintain the continuation of scientific advancements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the heart of inclusivity, cost plays a major role in separating researchers from the Open Access journals they would like to publish in. Over this year we’ve made great strides in partnering with institutions and consortia to bridge the gap between cost for prospective PLOS authors. And we’re continuing to experiment with new models that get closer to a truly open to read, open to publish ideal, equitably distributing the costs of publishing so that the burden of payment doesn’t fall on authors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps for a fair and diverse future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will continue to improve our processes and endeavour to be advocates for equity and inclusivity in OA and the broader academic community. Beyond 2020, scholarly communication will need to continue the work around creating inclusive environments for researchers by examining the struggles of systemic inequities, acknowledge bias by working with editors and reviewers, and ultimately take action to create a more accessible future for all. More updates to come! &lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;With acrobatic leaps, Hainan gibbons can cross a great gully carved by a 2014 landslide in the forest on China’s Hainan Island. But when a palm frond caught by the vaulting apes to steady their landing started to sag, researchers rushed to provide a safer route across.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though slow to adopt it, the gibbons &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72641-z&quot;&gt;increasingly traveled a bridge&lt;/a&gt; made of two ropes that was installed across the 15-meter gap, researchers report October 15 in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;. The finding suggests that such tethers could also help connect once-intact forests that have been fragmented by human activities and aid conservation efforts of these and other canopy dwellers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Fragmentation is becoming an increasing problem,” says Tremaine Gregory, a conservation biologist at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute in Washington, D.C., who wasn’t involved in the study. “It’s probably going to be, along with climate change, one of the biggest challenges for biodiversity in decades.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The landslide damaged an arboreal highway, a preferred route through the trees that the apes use to traverse the rainforest. Hainan gibbons (&lt;em&gt;Nomascus hainanus&lt;/em&gt;) are almost strictly arboreal, and forest fragmentation can divide the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/gibbons-have-been-disappearing-china-centuries&quot;&gt;already critically endangered primates&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/6/15&lt;/em&gt;) into smaller breeding populations, says Bosco Chan, a conservation biologist at the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden in Hong Kong. That can lead to inbreeding or local groups dying out.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Only about 30 individuals remain of this species, all living in a nature reserve on Hainan Island. For the group of nine gibbons studied, the researchers didn’t want the animals to get hurt crossing the gap.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enter the rope bridge. It took months for the gibbons to catch on, but about 176 days after the bridge’s installation, camera traps captured the gibbons taking to the ropes. “I was very excited when [the gibbons] first started using it,” Chan says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Hainan gibbons use a rope bridge&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3092427&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/101520_CW_gibbons-rope_inline.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3092427&quot;&gt;To cross a gully created by a landslide, some Hainan gibbons dangle and swing from a rope bridge installed by researchers, while others walk across, sometimes using the upper rope as a handrail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3092427&quot;&gt;Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the scientists observed the gibbons crossing the bridge about as frequently as the animals had traveled that stretch of forest before the landslide. Females and juveniles preferentially used the bridge, while an adult male never used it, and nearly grown juveniles rarely did.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the scientists expected the animals would swing along under the bridge using their arms, Chan says, many preferred to walk as though on a tightrope, using one rope as a handrail, or to climb along the ropes using all their limbs. Occasionally, gibbons scampered across without holding on with their upper limbs. For now, the bridge provides a temporary solution while transplants of native trees grow and other trees regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such artificial bridges provide a sensible and innovative approach to help gibbons get around safely, says Susan Cheyne, a primatologist based in Oxford, England, and vice chair of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gibbons.asia/&quot;&gt;International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Section on Small Apes&lt;/a&gt;, who advised the Hainan project. “We want them to stay up in the canopy.” On the ground, gibbons may get hit by cars, get into fights with dogs or be exposed to parasites that the animals wouldn’t typically encounter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the Hainan gibbons’ adoption of the bridge suggests that it’s a “tool that other primate conservation groups could potentially use,” Cheyne says, as these gibbons are a “relatively fickle species. They are not overly keen on using new things,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond primates, other animals may use such crossings too. The team also saw two squirrels and another rodent use the bridge. Depending on where canopy bridges are located, marsupials or rodents could benefit, though observing such creatures to know for sure could be a challenge if they are nocturnal.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authors: Ruth Schmidt is an Associate Professor at IIT’s Institute of Design and Anna Hatch is the program director for&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;DORA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. PLOS supports DORA financially via organizational membership, and PLOS is represented on the steering committee of DORA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making/&quot;&gt;part one &lt;/a&gt;of our series we showed how objective comparisons are not equitable . In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making-part-ii/&quot;&gt;second part&lt;/a&gt; of this series we showed how individual data points can accidentally distract from the whole. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making-part-iii/&quot;&gt;In part 3&lt;/a&gt; we explored how we gauge value by association. In our final installment we get into how &lt;strong&gt;incumbent processes and perceptions have the advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The deep legacy traditions held by many academic institutions can be powerful, contributing a sense of continuity and identity and reducing the need to continually reinvent the wheel. But when these organizational habits and norms become too normalized, and old processes and structures persist because “that’s how we’ve always done this,” they can create an unhealthy sense of insularity that excludes new ideas and people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One contributing factor to this is&lt;strong&gt; Confirmation bias&lt;/strong&gt;, which describes peoples’ tendencies to dismiss evidence that doesn’t fit their initial judgments or preconceptions, even if these presumptions are grounded in subjective experiences and limited data. Failing to gather and consider counter-evidence makes us more likely to fall into old ways of thinking, such as cherry-picking information from a CV to confirm the view we already have, or dismissing potential warning signs because a candidate has already been accepted as a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status quo bias&lt;/strong&gt;, sometimes known as “effort aversion,” reflects our tendency to take the path of least resistance unless there are strong reasons not to. This can lead to situations where people stick with recognizably flawed processes because the effort to fix them or adopt new ones is perceived as too much effort. For example, the continued use of citations to indicate research quality is driven in part by the fact that it’s perceived as familiar and easier, not necessarily better, than using alternate indicators of real-world impact. For academic institutions — never known as stealthy and agile entities even in the best of times — this can cause significant paralysis, keeping demonstrably subpar structures in place long past their usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can institutions do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it easy.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes the biggest barriers to adopting new behaviors are actually smaller than one might expect, such as not knowing where to start or a lack of clarity about the value of doing things differently. Making the benefits of new behaviors concrete, salient, and simple to grasp makes both starting and follow-through easier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question what you “know.”&lt;/strong&gt; Sticking with old assumptions tends to reward those with more traditional backgrounds, which comes at the expense of attracting new or more diverse talent. Productively pushing back on assumptions — even assigning the role of playing devil’s advocate during deliberations — can force all involved to be crisper and more defined about what qualities matter, and why.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broaden notions of success.&lt;/strong&gt; New processes can only go so far if definitions for success (and who’s invited to the table) aren’t also revisited. Setting, publicizing, and adhering to goals that look beyond traditional norms or value alternate experiences can broaden the diversity of individuals under consideration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Incumbent systems, processes, and structures are inherently advantaged, partly due to familiarity and partly because our tendency toward effort aversion tells us it’s almost always easier to stick with the old, however flawed, than introduce something new. This is especially true when those in positions of seniority have benefited from these legacy systems as their careers have progressed, and when in many cases entire academic careers spent at an individual institution may mean limited insight into even &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to do things differently. But the need to introduce more equitable decision-making into RPT decisions to increase the presence of minoritized candidates, researchers, and faculty is very real, and will not happen without a combination of serious intent and structural support. Without active intervention, one model of current post-doc to faculty transitions has indicated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/21393&quot;&gt;faculty diversity will not otherwise significantly increase until 2080&lt;/a&gt;. This is too little, too late.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;em&gt;To encourage the adoption of more equitable hiring, and RPT processes, the authors are collaborating on a series of tools for DORA to assist institutions in experimenting with new processes, indicators, and principles. Available &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/resources/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Four million monthly users. 1.7 million articles. More than one billion downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers are clear: arXiv is a critical resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what these numbers don’t reveal? The impact arXiv has had on individual people across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excitement of a grad student posting their first article. The junior faculty member who just earned tenure, thanks to research originally shared on arXiv. The productive researcher whose library cannot afford to subscribe to all the right journals. The weekly research group meeting to discuss the most recent arXiv papers. The interdisciplinary collaboration sparked by an arXiv submission. The machine learning enthusiast who tinkers with the arXiv dataset, future discoveries yet unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“arXiv is like air.”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the words of an arXiv-er. In other words, arXiv is free, totally necessary, and easy to take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But arXiv is not free to produce, which is why we’re asking you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1717/alumni/event.aspx?sid=1717&amp;amp;gid=2&amp;amp;pgid=22315&amp;amp;cid=35778&amp;amp;dids=276&amp;amp;bledit=1&amp;amp;sort=1&quot;&gt;join arXiv’s community of supporters with a donation&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;strong&gt;International Open Access Week&lt;/strong&gt;, from October 19th through the 23rd. We urge you to consider recurring payments in any amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 80% of arXiv’s operating budget comes from voluntary contributions from the Simons Foundation, member institutions, and &lt;strong&gt;individuals like you&lt;/strong&gt;. Your contribution will help ensure that arXiv remains &lt;strong&gt;a non-commercial, community resource.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the age of about 75, people tend to feel more anxiety, sadness and loneliness, and less in the way of positive emotion. Strategies to prevent or at least counteract these deteriorations are badly needed, and new &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-69974-001&quot;&gt;research by a team in the US&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt;, has now identified one apparently promising strategy: so-called “awe walks”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40572&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As Virginia Strum at the University of California and her colleagues note, awe is a positive emotion felt by people “when they are in the presence of something vast that they cannot immediately understand”. A walk through a desert, a beautiful piece of art, a wedding — all of these things, and more, can lead to feelings of awe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier work shows that when we feel awe, our focus shifts from our self to the wider world, leading us to perceive ourselves as being less significant, or “smaller”, and also making us feel more socially connected to our community. This could lead to a rise in positive, prosocial emotions, the team reasoned — and might help to combat typical age-related increases in negative emotions and loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To investigate the potential of their awe walk idea, the team recruited 52 healthy adults aged 60 to 90, half of whom formed a control group. Both groups were told to take a 15 minute outdoor walk, ideally alone, every week for eight weeks, and to take three photographs of themselves each time — one before, one during and one after the walk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only the awe group was told that “with the right outlook, awe can be found almost anywhere, but it is most likely to occur in places that involve two key features: physical vastness and novelty”. This group were asked to tap into their “sense of wonder” and to try to go somewhere new each week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The participants completed a battery of surveys before, during and after their walk programmes. And the team found some key differences between the two groups. Firstly, as the researchers had predicted, the awe group reported feeling more awe while walking. Over time, they also felt more socially connected, and reported bigger increases in positive emotions — including prosocial emotions such as gratitude and compassion, and also joy — while they were walking. The boost in prosocial emotions, specifically, carried through into everyday life. Daily distress also decreased more over time in the awe group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also analysed the participants’ photographs. They concluded that, with more walks under their belt, the smiles of those in the awe group became more intense. Whether you consider smiles to be expressions of happiness, as the team does, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/02/a-radical-new-theory-proposes-that-facial-expressions-are-not-emotional-displays-but-tools-for-social-influence/&quot;&gt;social signals of a willingness to affiliate&lt;/a&gt;, this could potentially lead to more positive social interactions. Unlike the control group, over time, members of the awe group also came to occupy less physical space, relative to the background, in their selfies. The researchers interpret this as reflecting that the awe group were feeling “smaller” over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the team cautions, most of the participants were White and highly educated, so the results may not generalise to other groups. However, the fact that they were mostly highly educated could be significant in itself. The participants did not complete personality tests. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656600923092&quot;&gt;educational achievement is associated with greater openness to experience&lt;/a&gt;, a personality trait that entails enjoying new things. If the awe group were particularly open to experience then presumably they enjoyed the novelty of walking somewhere new each time, and this may have led to an increase in positive emotions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What about the finding that, over time, the awe group took up less space in their selfies? Again, they were told to try to walk somewhere new each time — and that vast spaces are more likely to trigger awe. It certainly seems possible that, with growing confidence, they chose to travel to renowned beauty spots, rather than a local park, say, and selfies at those beauty spots may be more likely to contain large background features such as a mountain (which features in the paper as an example of a “big background” constituent of one awe group selfie).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whatever the reasons behind the findings, the work does suggest that — for highly educated, healthy older people, at least — “awe walks” are beneficial. And, despite the potential risks associated with encouraging older people to walk alone in vast, unfamiliar natural settings, there could clearly be physical health benefits, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-69974-001&quot;&gt;Big smile, small self: Awe walks promote prosocial positive emotions in older adults&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Even as U.S. President Donald Trump claims his bout with COVID-19 has granted him immunity, reports of people getting the disease a second time are emerging. While reinfection still appears to be rare, it remains unclear to what extent immunity can truly protect a person. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Immunity is also in the news because a debate is simmering among scientists over herd immunity, the point at which enough people are immune to a pathogen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-when-will-coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing-end&quot;&gt;slow its spread&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/24/20&lt;/em&gt;). While herd immunity might put the end of the pandemic in sight, experts estimate that around 40 to 60 percent of a population would need to be infected to reach it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gbdeclaration.org/&quot;&gt;One group&lt;/a&gt; of researchers is pushing for governments to reach herd immunity without a vaccine, by allowing COVID-19 to spread among those at low risk while protecting vulnerable populations. This approach, however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2932153-X&quot;&gt;puts the entire population at risk&lt;/a&gt; of significant illness and death, another group argues in a letter published October 14 in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Because SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, scientists can’t say how long a person will be protected after they’ve recovered from an infection. If immunity wanes quickly, that sets the stage for recurrent outbreaks unless there’s a vaccine, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we know so far about our long-term defenses against the coronavirus: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;What does “immunity” really mean?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To scientists, immunity means a resistance to a disease gained through the immune system’s exposure to it, either by infection or through vaccination. But immunity doesn’t always mean complete protection from the virus. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;How does the body build immunity?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The immune system has two ways to provide lasting protection: T cells that remember the pathogen and trigger a rapid response, and B cells that produce antibodies — proteins the body makes to fight off a specific pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ideally, long after a person has recovered from an infection, these antibodies stick around in their blood. Then if the person is exposed to the same pathogen again in the future, those antibodies recognize the threat and work to prevent another infection from taking hold.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So-called “memory T cells” also stick around. Ideally, they live up to their name and recognize a previously encountered pathogen and either help coordinate the immune system or kill infected cells.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With one type of immunity, called sterilizing immunity, the virus never gets a chance to begin replicating and never infects a cell. Sterilizing immunity, however, is hard to achieve. More often, people achieve partial immunity, which provides a rapid response that may make the second bout of the disease less severe, or less easily transmitted to others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what type of immunity people who have recovered from COVID-19 have, and only time will tell. A vaccine could possibly trigger a stronger immune response than a natural infection, although it’s yet to be seen if that will be the case for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trials-speed-safety&quot;&gt;coronavirus vaccines&lt;/a&gt; in trials &lt;em&gt;(SN: 7/10/20).&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;If a person has antibodies, are they immune?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For some illnesses, like measles, antibodies may last a lifetime. But for SARS-CoV-2, the jury is still out. It’s unknown how long antibodies last in the blood, or — importantly — whether their presence is a sign of immunity. Just because a person has antibodies, it doesn’t mean they are effective at fighting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neutralizing antibodies are ones that halt the virus in its tracks, stopping it from infecting a host cell and replicating. Such antibodies typically recognize the virus’ spike protein, which helps it break into host cells. So far, those kinds of antibodies have been a focus of studies seeking to understand whether a person may be immune.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For the majority of people, it does appear that they are generating neutralizing antibodies,” says Aubree Gordon, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “So that’s promising.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet it’s still unknown what amount of neutralizing antibody is sufficient for protection. And even if they are protective, it’s unclear how long these immune proteins stick around. Studies of recovered COVID-19 patients have shown that antibodies for the coronavirus can wane after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but overall, their levels remain &lt;a href=&quot;https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/5/52/eabe0367&quot;&gt;relatively stable&lt;/a&gt; over a span of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20151126v1&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20159178v1&quot;&gt;six&lt;/a&gt; months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the coronavirus only began its sweep around the world at the beginning of the year, “there’s just been a limited time for people to study this,” Gordon says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some data suggest the immune system might not have a great memory for coronavirus infections. One study found that during a COVID-19 infection, the organ that produces memory B cells — long-lived cells that will rapidly produce antibodies if a person is re-exposed to a pathogen — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31067-9&quot;&gt;doesn’t properly activate&lt;/a&gt; the cell types capable of becoming memory B cells. Without that immunological memory, antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 may not last very long, researchers report August 19 in &lt;em&gt;Cell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Maybe that means that those memory responses are going to be on the short side,” says Brianne Barker, an immunologist at Drew University in Madison, N.J.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;What do we know about T cells?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that COVID-19 patients &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31008-4?rss=yes&quot;&gt;typically develop&lt;/a&gt; an immune response involving T cells. Even recovered patients without a detectable antibody response have &lt;a href=&quot;https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/1/20-3772_article?ACSTrackingID=USCDC_333-DM40563&amp;amp;ACSTrackingLabel=Latest%20Expedited%20Articles%20-%20Emerging%20Infectious%20Diseases%20Journal%20-%20October%2015%2C%202020&amp;amp;deliveryName=USCDC_333-DM40563&quot;&gt;T cells&lt;/a&gt; in their blood, researchers report October 15 in &lt;em&gt;Emerging Infectious Diseases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the role of T cells in infection and immune memory remains unclear. Studies have shown that memory T cells can persist in patients who were infected with the coronavirus responsible for the 2003–2004 SARS outbreak for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16002589&quot;&gt;up to 11 years&lt;/a&gt; after recovery. Since that virus no longer circulates, however, it’s impossible to say whether those T cells might be protective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some people may already have T cells that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-t-cells-patients-immune-system&quot;&gt;can recognize pieces&lt;/a&gt; of the new coronavirus (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/15/20&lt;/em&gt;). Those immune cells may be left over from &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/08/04/science.abd3871?versioned=true&quot;&gt;previous exposures to coronaviruses&lt;/a&gt; that cause the common cold, researchers report August 4 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. These &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-020-00460-4&quot;&gt;cross-reactive T cells&lt;/a&gt; might help reduce the length or severity of COVID-19 illness. On the flip side, such &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/early-immune-responses-young-people-covid19-coronavirus&quot;&gt;T cells&lt;/a&gt; could make the disease worse, perhaps by overstimulating the immune system and causing a condition called cytokine storm, which is behind some severe COVID-19 cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Can you get the coronavirus twice?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have now documented a small number of cases where people have been infected with the coronavirus twice. The first such case was reported in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-first-case-reinfection-man-hong-kong&quot;&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, with additional reports the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2820%2930764-7/fulltext&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1538/5920950&quot;&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/24/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it’s still unclear how common reinfections are. And with only a handful of cases so far, “we can’t really say that reinfections are telling us a whole lot at this point,” Barker says, either about immunity or whether vaccines will provide long-term protection or will need to become part of our yearly routine, like flu shots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some reinfections are expected; some people’s immune memory may not be potent enough to prevent the infection entirely, though it may prevent them from getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to prove that someone has been reinfected, because researchers need to conclusively show that two different viruses caused each infection, Barker says. That requires genetic testing. What’s more, experts are not necessarily on the lookout for such cases, especially in people who are not displaying symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;What does all of this mean for herd immunity?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Without knowing how long immunity lasts after an infection, and how much that varies from person to person, it’s impossible to know whether ending the pandemic through herd immunity is even possible. What is clear, experts say, is that attempting to reach herd immunity without a vaccine will lead to more illness and death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Promoting the concept of ‘herd immunity’ … as an answer to the COVID-19 pandemic is inappropriate, irresponsible and ill-informed,” Thomas File Jr., president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and Judith Feinberg, chair of the HIV Medicine Association, said in a statement October 14.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And to date, herd immunity is still far off. “Throughout the United States, we are nowhere near herd immunity,” Gordon says. “Taking the approach of herd immunity through natural infection will lead to hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths.” &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A few minutes in the microwave made a common insecticide about 10 times more lethal to mosquitoes in lab experiments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The toxin deltamethrin is used around the world in home sprays and bed nets to curb the spread of mosquito-borne diseases like malaria — which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria&quot;&gt;kills over 400,000 people each year&lt;/a&gt;, according to the World Health Organization. But “mosquitoes the world over are showing resistance to deltamethrin and [similar] compounds,” says Bart Kahr, a crystallographer at New York University who has helped develop &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2013390117&quot;&gt;a more potent form of deltamethrin&lt;/a&gt; by heating it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This form of deltamethrin may stand a better chance of killing insecticide-resistant pests, Kahr and colleagues report online October 12 in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;. Malaria has been essentially eradicated in the United States, but more effective pesticides could be a boon for regions like sub-Saharan Africa, where the disease is a major public health problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kahr’s team increased the potency of commercial deltamethrin dust spray simply by melting a vial of it — either by heating it to 150° Celsius in an oil bath for five minutes or by popping it in a 700-watt microwave for the same amount of time. While the microscopic deltamethrin crystals in the original spray have a haphazard structure, which looks like a jumble of misaligned flakes, the melted deltamethrin crystals solidified into starburst shapes when they cooled to room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;deltamethrin crystals in typical insecticide spray (left) and a new version (right)&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3092396&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/101420_mt_mosquito_inline_mobile_680.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3092396&quot;&gt;The deltamethrin crystals in typical insecticide spray (left microscope image) contain “lots of individual leaflets that are kind of oriented in a helter-skelter manner,” says crystallographer Bart Kahr of New York University. In a new version of the spray, deltamethrin crystals are shaped more like starbursts, with fibers growing out from a single point (right).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3092396&quot;&gt;Jingxiang Yang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chemical bonds between deltamethrin molecules in the starburst-shaped crystals are not as strong as those in the original microcrystal structure. “The molecules are intrinsically less happy, or settled, in the arrangement,” Kahr says. So, when a mosquito lands on a dusting of starburst-shaped crystals, it should be easier for deltamethrin molecules to be absorbed into the insect’s body via its feet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested the more potent version of deltamethrin on lab-bred mosquitoes from two species: &lt;em&gt;Anopheles quadrimaculatus&lt;/em&gt;, which can spread malaria, and &lt;em&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/em&gt;, which can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/protein-mosquito-eggshells-could-be-insect-achilles-heel&quot;&gt;transmit other life-threatening diseases&lt;/a&gt;, such as Zika and dengue (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/8/19&lt;/em&gt;). Forty mosquitoes of each species were released into petri dishes coated in the original deltamethrin dust spray, and another 40 into a dish covered in the new form of the insecticide.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;That altered version of deltamethrin knocked out about half of exposed &lt;em&gt;A. quadrimaculatus &lt;/em&gt;mosquitoes within 24 minutes. In contrast, it took nearly five hours for the original spray to knock out half of exposed &lt;em&gt;Anopheles&lt;/em&gt; — about 12 times as long. Likewise, it took only 21 minutes for the new spray to knock out half of exposed &lt;em&gt;A. aegypti&lt;/em&gt;, while it took the original spray over three hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;A. quadrimaculatus &lt;/em&gt;can carry the parasite that causes malaria, this mosquito species is native to North America, where the disease is not a major public health crisis. To ensure the new type of deltamethrin would be effective in the world’s malarial hot spots, “we need to do these experiments with species called &lt;em&gt;gambiae&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;funestus&lt;/em&gt;, which are the African &lt;em&gt;Anopheles&lt;/em&gt; mosquito species,” Kahr says, as well as the six major malaria-spreading &lt;em&gt;Anopheles&lt;/em&gt; species in South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Heat treatment for deltamethrin sprays “might increase their toxicity, but there are several obvious experiments that we would need to do before we would even think about adding this to the production system,” says Janet Hemingway of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in England, who studies mosquito insecticide resistance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, researchers need to test the new version of the insecticide against pesticide-resistant mosquitoes. Mosquito resistance to deltamethrin, along with other chemicals in the class of synthetic pesticides known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquitoes-remade&quot;&gt;pyrethroids&lt;/a&gt;, is a growing problem (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/29/12&lt;/em&gt;). “My prediction … is that [the insects] would be highly resistant to both forms,” Hemingway says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers also need to ensure that the more toxic form of deltamethrin is safe for people to be around, says Hemingway, who was not involved in the study. “Bottom line — interesting observation, but one that is a good distance from something that could be implemented.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-remdesivir-who-hydroxychloroquine-interferon-lopinavir-solidarity"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092433</id>
		<updated>2020-10-16T21:59:51+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Remdesivir, an antiviral drug that was the first found to combat COVID-19, doesn’t reduce deaths from the disease, a large international study found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization’s Solidarity trial, which combined data from 405 hospitals in 30 countries, randomly assigned more than 11,000 people hospitalized with COVID-19 to receive one of four drugs or standard care, which could include other drugs such as steroids. The tested drugs include remdesivir, the antimalaria drug hydroxychloroquine, an anti-HIV drug called lopinavir and interferon-beta1a. Interferon is an immune system chemical that triggers the body’s antiviral defenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.20209817v1&quot;&gt;None of the drugs showed any benefit in reducing deaths&lt;/a&gt;, the need for ventilation or the length of hospital stays, researchers report October 15 in a preliminary study posted at medRxiv.org. The work has not been vetted by other scientists yet, and some analyses may change during the peer-review process, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other studies had already shown that neither &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-pandemic-hiv-drugs-do-not-work-treatment-clinical-trial&quot;&gt;lopinavir&lt;/a&gt; — given in combination with ritonavir, a drug that boosts lopinavir’s levels in the body — nor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-no-evidence-treatment&quot;&gt;hydroxychloroquine&lt;/a&gt; were effective against the novel coronavirus (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/19/20; SN: 8/2/20&lt;/em&gt;). These studies, in addition to the new data, deliver a clear message that those drugs are not helpful for treating COVID-19, says David Brett-Major, a medical epidemiologist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But remdesivir has been shown to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-remdesivir-first-drug-recovery-treatment&quot;&gt;shave four days off of hospital stays&lt;/a&gt; in a trial conducted by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/29/20&lt;/em&gt;). In that study, the drug “showed a trend toward reducing deaths,” but the result wasn’t statistically meaningful. Preliminary results from small studies conducted by remdesivir’s maker, Gilead Sciences of Foster City, Calif., also suggested that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/remdesivir-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-gilead&quot;&gt;drug might cut the chance of dying&lt;/a&gt; from the disease (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/13/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The drug currently has emergency authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in all hospitalized patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the WHO study, 301 of 2,743 people hospitalized with COVID-19 taking remdesivir died, compared with 303 of 2,708 people in the group getting standard care. That result indicates that remdesivir doesn’t have a mortality benefit, says Helen Boucher, chief of infectious diseases at Tufts Medical Center in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean remdesivir isn’t helpful, she says. Shortening hospital stays is the reason remdesivir has been embraced, at least in the United States, Boucher says. The new WHO study aside, “the data we have now suggests it’s a four-day benefit, 11 days versus 15 days” with a placebo, she says. “That’s significant for people who are sick in the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m very comfortable as a physician recommending this medicine based on the data showing a shorter time to be better,” Boucher says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the new WHO study found that remdesivir doesn’t reduce length of hospital stays, the trial was designed to show only whether the drugs could reduce the risk of dying. So its conclusions about whether remdesivir shortens hospital stays or cuts the risk of going on a ventilator need a closer look, Brett-Major says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s also in part because the WHO study combined data from hundreds of hospitals in 30 countries. A closer analysis of data from individual study sites may show a clearer picture of how remdesivir performed in different settings. Hospitalization time and whether someone is put on a ventilator may also depend on other factors, such as how many hospital beds or ventilators are available. Remdesivir may still improve outcomes for individual patients in the right circumstances, Brett-Major says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the short term, the new study probably won’t change how remdesivir is used, says Joanne Turner, an immunologist and vice president for research at the Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio. But as more studies are done, “we’ll get clarity on when it should be used,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many hospitalized patients, for example, are suffering more from overexuberant immune systems trying to fight off the virus. By that time, it may be too late for a drug that prevents viral replication like remdesivir to make a difference. In the WHO study, “if the drug did stop viral replication [for patients], it clearly wasn’t changing outcomes for them,” Turner says. “This will make doctors think about whether this drug is really useful in very sick people.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But giving remdesivir to sick people earlier might help, experts say. Boucher and colleagues are part of a study testing the drug in people who are newly diagnosed with COVID-19 to see if can prevent hospitalization and severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Consumers have long turned to vitamins and herbs to try to protect themselves from disease. This pandemic is no different — especially with headlines that scream &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msn.com/en-in/health/familyhealth/the-one-supplement-that-could-save-you-from-the-coronavirus/ar-BB147ruy&quot;&gt;“This supplement could save you from coronavirus.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also helps to have celebrity enthusiasts. When President Donald Trump was diagnosed with COVID-19, his pill arsenal included Vitamin D and zinc. And in an Instagram chat with actress Jennifer Garner in September, infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci touted vitamins C and D as ways that might generally boost the immune system. “If you’re deficient in vitamin D,” he noted, “that does have an impact on your susceptibility to infection. I would not mind recommending, and I do it myself, taking vitamin D supplements.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But whether over-the-counter supplements can actually prevent, or even treat, COVID-19, is not clear. Since the disease is so new, researchers haven’t had much time for the kind of large experiments that provide the best answers. Instead, scientists have mostly relied on fresh takes on old data. Some studies have looked at outcomes of patients who routinely take certain supplements — and found some promising hints. But so far there’s little data from the kinds of scientifically rigorous experiments that give doctors confidence when recommending supplements.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we know today about three supplements getting plenty of attention around COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it is:&lt;/strong&gt; Called “the sunshine vitamin” because the body makes it naturally in the presence of ultraviolet light, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vitamin-d-supplements-lose-luster&quot;&gt;Vitamin D is one of the most heavily studied&lt;/a&gt; supplements (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/27/19&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;a href=&quot;https://health.gov/our-work/food-nutrition/2015-2020-dietary-guidelines/guidelines/appendix-12/&quot;&gt;Certain foods&lt;/a&gt;, including fish and fortified milk products, are also high in the vitamin. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it might help&lt;/strong&gt;: Vitamin D is a hormone building block that helps strengthen the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works for other infections:&lt;/strong&gt; In 2017, the &lt;em&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/em&gt; published a meta-analysis that suggested a daily vitamin D supplement &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.i6583&quot;&gt;might help prevent respiratory infections&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in people who are deficient in the vitamin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But one key word here is &lt;em&gt;deficient. &lt;/em&gt;That risk is highest during dark winters at high latitudes and among people with more color in their skin (melanin, a pigment that’s higher in darker skin, inhibits the production of vitamin D).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have enough vitamin D in your body, the evidence doesn’t stack up to say that giving you more will make a real difference,” says Susan Lanham-New, head of the nutritional sciences department at the University of Surrey in England.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And taking too much can create new health problems, stressing certain internal organs and leading to a dangerously high calcium buildup in the blood. The recommended daily allowance for adults is 600 to 800 international units per day, and the upper limit is considered to be 4,000 IU per day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we know about Vitamin D and COVID-19:&lt;/strong&gt; Few studies have looked directly at whether vitamin D makes a difference in COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In May, in the &lt;em&gt;BMJ Nutrition, Prevention &amp;amp; Health&lt;/em&gt;, Lanham-New and her colleagues published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7246103/&quot;&gt;summary of existing evidence &lt;/a&gt;and concluded that there’s only enough to recommend vitamin D to help with COVID-19 prevention for people who are deficient. That paper made inferences from how vitamin D works against other respiratory tract infections and immune health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More than a dozen studies are now testing vitamin D directly for prevention and treatment, including a large one led by JoAnn Manson, a leading expert on vitamin D and an epidemiologist and preventive medicine physician at Harvard Medical School and Brigham &amp;amp; Women’s Hospital in Boston. That study will analyze if vitamin D can affect the course of a COVID-19 infection. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551714420302548&quot;&gt;The trial&lt;/a&gt; aims to recruit 2,700 people across the United States with newly diagnosed infections, along with their close household contacts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The goal is to determine whether newly diagnosed people given high doses of vitamin D — 3,200 IU per day — are less likely than people who get a placebo to experience severe symptoms and need hospitalization. “The biological plausibility for a benefit in COVID is compelling,” she says, given the nutrient’s theoretical ability to impede the severe inflammatory reaction that can follow coronavirus infection. “However the evidence is not conclusive at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Zinc&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it is:&lt;/strong&gt; Zinc, a mineral found in cells all over the body, is found naturally in certain meats, beans and oysters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it might help&lt;/strong&gt;: It plays several supportive roles in the immune system, which is why zinc lozenges are always hot sellers in cold and flu season. Zinc also helps with cell division and growth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works for other infections:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6457799/&quot;&gt;Studies of using zinc for colds&lt;/a&gt; — which are frequently caused by coronaviruses — suggest that using a supplement right after symptoms start might make them go away quicker. That said, a clinical trial from researchers in Finland and the United Kingdom, published in January in &lt;em&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/10/1/e031662&quot;&gt;did not find any value for zinc lozenges&lt;/a&gt; for the treatment of colds. Some researchers have theorized that inconsistences in data for colds may be explained by varying amounts of zinc released in different lozenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we know about zinc and COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;: The mineral is promising enough that it was added to some early studies of hydroxychloroquine, a drug tested early in the pandemic. (Studies have since shown that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-no-evidence-treatment&quot;&gt;hydroxychloroquine can’t prevent or treat COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/2/20&lt;/em&gt;).)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In July, researchers from Aachen University in Germany wrote in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers of Immunology&lt;/em&gt; that current evidence “strongly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01712/full&quot;&gt;suggests great benefits of zinc&lt;/a&gt; supplementation” based on looking at similar infections including SARS, another disease caused by a coronavirus. For example, studies suggest that giving zinc reduces the risk for death from a pneumonia infection. The researchers cite evidence that zinc might help prevent the virus from entering the body, and help slow the virus’s replication when it does.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another review — also based on indirect evidence — published August 1 in &lt;em&gt;Advances in Integrative Medicine&lt;/em&gt; also concluded that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7395818/&quot;&gt;zinc might be helpful in people who are deficient&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In September, researchers from Hospital Del Mar in Barcelona &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.univadis.co.uk/viewarticle/eccvid-2020-lower-plasma-zinc-levels-associated-with-increased-risk-of-death-in-covid-19-patients-729760&quot;&gt;reported that among 249 patients studied&lt;/a&gt;, those who survived COVID had higher zinc levels in their plasma (an average of 63.1 mcg/dl) than those who died (43mcg/dl).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, the jury is still out, says Suma Thomas, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, who in June led a team that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ccjm.org/content/early/2020/06/08/ccjm.87a.ccc046&quot;&gt;reviewed the evidence for popular supplements&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. Given what’s already known, zinc could possibly decrease the duration of infection but not the severity of symptoms, she said, particularly among people who are deficient. About a dozen studies are now looking at zinc for COVID-19 treatment, often with other drugs or supplements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thomas and her colleagues are &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04342728?term=zinc&amp;amp;cond=covid-19&amp;amp;cntry=US&amp;amp;draw=2&amp;amp;rank=2&quot;&gt;comparing symptom severity and future hospitalization&lt;/a&gt; in COVID-19 patients who take zinc with and without high doses of vitamin C with those who receive ordinary care without the supplement. Results are expected soon, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Vitamin C&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it is&lt;/strong&gt;: Also called L-ascorbic acid, vitamin C has a long list of roles in the body. It’s found naturally in fruits and vegetables, especially citrus, peppers and tomatoes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it might help:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a potent antioxidant that’s important for a healthy immune system and preventing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works for other infections:&lt;/strong&gt; Thomas cautions that the data on vitamin C are often contradictory. One review from Chinese researchers, published in February in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Medical Virolog&lt;/em&gt;y, looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmv.25707&quot;&gt;what is already known about vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; and other supplements that might have a role in COVID-19 treatment. Among other encouraging signs, human studies find a lower incidence of pneumonia among people taking vitamin C, “suggesting that vitamin C might prevent the susceptibility to lower respiratory tract infections under certain conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But for preventing colds, a 2013 Cochrane review of 29 studies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000980.pub4/full&quot;&gt;didn’t support the idea&lt;/a&gt; that vitamin C supplements could help in the general population. However, the authors wrote, given that vitamin C is cheap and safe, “it may be worthwhile for common cold patients to test on an individual basis whether therapeutic vitamin C is beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we know about Vitamin C and COVID-19:&lt;/strong&gt; About a dozen studies are under way or planned to examine whether vitamin C added to coronavirus treatment helps with symptoms or survival, including Thomas’ study at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a review published online in July in &lt;em&gt;Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, researchers from KU Leuven in Belgium concluded that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000980.pub4/full&quot;&gt;vitamin may help prevent infection&lt;/a&gt; and tamp down the dangerous inflammatory reaction that can cause severe symptoms, based on what is known about how the nutrient works in the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Melissa Badowski, a pharmacist who specializes in viral infections at the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Pharmacy, and colleague Sarah Michienzi published an extensive look at all supplements that might be useful in the coronavirus epidemic. There’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drugsincontext.com/can-vitamins-and-or-supplements-provide-hope-against-coronavirus/&quot;&gt;still not enough evidence to know whether they are helpful&lt;/a&gt;, the pair concluded in July in &lt;em&gt;Drugs in Context&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s not really clear if it’s going to benefit patients,” Badowski says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while supplements are generally safe, she adds that nothing is risk free. The best way to avoid infection, she says, is still to follow the advice of epidemiologists and public health experts: “Wash your hands, wear a mask, stay six feet apart.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the first time, researchers have looked at what happens in the brain when people take the psychedelic drug salvinorin A, from the plant &lt;em&gt;salvia divinorum&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;The team found that the drug disrupts the default mode network, a set of areas that are normally synchronised when we’re not engaged in any particular task, similar to the effects found for the “classical” psychedelic drugs like psilocybin. But the &lt;em&gt;subjective &lt;/em&gt;effects of salvinorin A are quite different to the effects of those other drugs, leaving some researchers questioning how important the default mode network really is to the psychedelic experience. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/this-is-my-brain-on-salvia/&quot;&gt;Daniel Oberhaus, who participated in the trial, has the story&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40561&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study in the 1980s claimed that married couples begin to look more alike over time — but now a larger replication has failed to find any evidence that that is true. &lt;/strong&gt;Instead the new study suggests that people tend to partner up with those who already look similar to them, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/12/researchers-crack-question-of-whether-couples-start-looking-alike&quot;&gt;reports Ian Sample&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s been more than a decade since the replication crisis became a well-known issue in psychology, and in science more generally. So has anything changed? &lt;/strong&gt;Not a lot, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21504366/science-replication-crisis-peer-review-statistics&quot;&gt;writes Kelsey Piper&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Vox, &lt;/em&gt;although there have been some small victories along the way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How people behave in virtual reality scenarios can provide insight into their personality&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/how-we-discovered-that-vr-can-profile-your-personality-147949&quot;&gt;writes researcher Stephen Fairclough&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;. His team created a VR environment in which participants had to navigate across ice blocks suspended high above the ground. People who took a more risk-averse approach to the task tended to be higher in neuroticism. The study highlights privacy issues around VR, Fairclough writes, as it suggests companies could profile users’ personality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many New Yorkers fail to show up to court for low-level offenses &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; so researchers have helped the city redesign its court summons to “nudge” people into attending. &lt;/strong&gt;The tweaks to the form included displaying the key information such as date and court location more prominently, as well as highlighting the consequences of not showing up, and resulted in 13% fewer missed court dates, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/10/new-york-city-uses-nudges-reduce-missed-court-dates&quot;&gt;reports Catherine Matacic&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists have identified how different types of thirst are encoded in the brain (in mice, at least).&lt;/strong&gt; Different combinations of neurons in a region called the circumventricular organ were active when mice needed pure water, compared to when they needed water and salt (as you might after a sweaty workout). And depending on which set of neurons the researchers later stimulated, mice chose to drink either just water or a mouse “sports drink”, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/10/14/923658129/water-or-a-sports-drink-these-brain-cells-may-decide-which-one-we-crave?utm_medium=RSS&amp;amp;utm_campaign=science&quot;&gt;reports Jon Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, there’s more this week on how researchers are analysing the words used on social media to make inferences about the emotional state of the population. &lt;/strong&gt;According to some psychologists, these methods show that our collective mood is pretty low, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/style/self-care/social-media-.html&quot;&gt;writes Casey Schwartz&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;em&gt;New York Times.&lt;/em&gt; But others say that the language used on Twitter is far from representative of how the general population is feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Put into music, telescope observations of the center of the Milky Way create a tranquil tune, glittering with xylophone and piano notes. The iconic Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula, meanwhile, sound like an eerie sci-fi score. And the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A is a sweeping symphony.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href=&quot;https://chandra.si.edu/photo/2020/sonify/?linkId=100235717&quot;&gt;musical renditions, or sonifications&lt;/a&gt;, were released on September 22 by NASA’s Chandra X-ray Center. “Listening to the data gives [people] another dimension to experience the universe,” says Matt Russo, an astrophysicist and musician at the astronomy outreach project &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.system-sounds.com/&quot;&gt;SYSTEM Sounds&lt;/a&gt; in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sonification can make cosmic wonders more accessible to people with blindness or visual impairments, and complement images for sighted learners. SYSTEM Sounds teamed up with Kimberly Arcand, a visualization scientist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., to create the new pieces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Christine Malec, a musician and astronomy enthusiast who is blind, vividly recalls the first sonification she ever heard — a rendering of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seven-earth-sized-planets-orbit-nearby-supercool-star&quot;&gt;TRAPPIST-1 planetary system&lt;/a&gt; that Russo played during a planetarium show in Toronto (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/22/17&lt;/em&gt;). “I had goosebumps, because I felt like I was getting a faint impression of what it’s like to perceive the night sky, or a cosmological phenomenon,” she says. Music affords data “a spatial quality that astronomical phenomena have, but that words can’t quite convey.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The new renditions combine data from multiple telescopes tuned to different types of light. The sonification of an image of the Milky Way’s center, for instance, includes observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, optical images from the Hubble Space Telescope and infrared observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope. Users can listen to data from each telescope alone or the trio in harmony.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;New data “sonifications” translate telescope images into songs. Listen to observations of celestial objects around the Milky Way, from the galactic center to the star-forming Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a cursor pans from left to right across the image of the galactic center, showing a 400-light-year expanse, Chandra X-ray observations, played on the xylophone, trace filaments of superhot gas. Hubble observations on the violin highlight pockets of star formation, and Spitzer’s piano notes illuminate infrared clouds of gas and dust. Light sources near the top of the image play at higher pitches, and brighter objects play louder. The song crescendos around a luminous region in the lower-right corner of the image, where glowing gas and dust shroud the galaxy’s supermassive black hole.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Layering the instruments on top of each other gives the observations an element of texture, Malec says. “It appealed to my musical sense, because it was done in a harmonious way — it was not discordant.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That was on purpose. “We wanted to create an output that was not just scientifically accurate, but also hopefully nice to listen to,” Arcand says. “It was a matter of making sure that the instruments played together in symphony.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But discordant sounds can also can be educational, Malec says. She points to the new sonification of supernova remnant Cassiopeia A: The sonification traces chemical elements throughout &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/while-exploding-supernovas-not-spherical&quot;&gt;this great plume of celestial debris&lt;/a&gt; using notes played on stringed instruments (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/19/14&lt;/em&gt;). Those notes make a pretty harmony, but they can be difficult to tell apart, Malec says. “I would have picked very different instruments” to make it easier for the ear to follow — perhaps a violin paired with a trumpet or an organ.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While sonification is a valuable tool to get the public interested in astronomy, it also has untapped potential to help professional astronomers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/musician-composes-solar-soundtrack&quot;&gt;analyze data&lt;/a&gt;, says Wanda Díaz-Merced, an astronomer who is also at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics but was not involved in the project (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/22/14&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Astronomers including Díaz-Merced, who is blind, have used sonifications to study stars, solar wind and cosmic rays. And in experiments, Díaz-Merced has demonstrated that sighted &lt;a href=&quot;http://theses.gla.ac.uk/5804/&quot;&gt;astronomers can better pick out signals&lt;/a&gt; in datasets by analyzing audio and visual information together rather than relying on vision alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, efforts to sonify astronomy datasets for research have been rare. Making data sonification a mainstream research method would not only break down barriers to pursuing astronomy research, but may also lead to many new discoveries, she says.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ebola-virus-first-treatment-fda-approval-antibodies"/>

		<updated>2020-10-15T16:48:30+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;There is now an approved treatment for Ebola, one of the world’s deadliest diseases. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced October 14 that Inmazeb, a cocktail of lab-made antibodies developed by the pharmaceutical company Regeneron, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-ebola-virus&quot;&gt;can be used to treat adult and pediatric patients with Ebola&lt;/a&gt;. The announcement comes less than a year after the FDA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-ebola-vaccine-wins-fda-approval&quot;&gt;greenlit the first Ebola vaccine&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/20/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a big development,” says Erica Ollmann Saphire, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego, Calif. Ebola virus causes severe illness, including fever, vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding. Outbreaks of the disease, discovered in the 1970s, can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/congo-ebola-outbreak-testing-new-treatments&quot;&gt;kill 25 to 90 percent of those infected&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/11/19&lt;/em&gt;). Previously, people could only be helped by supportive therapies, like replacing lost fluids, Saphire says. “But this approval means Ebola is now a treatable disease.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Inmazeb was evaluated along with three other experimental Ebola treatments in a clinical trial conducted in the Congo in 2018 and 2019 amid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/two-ebola-treatments-prove-highly-effective-clinical-trial&quot;&gt;the second largest outbreak of the disease&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/12/19&lt;/em&gt;). During the trial, 33.8 percent of people treated with Inmazeb died after 28 days, compared with 51 percent of people who received a different treatment. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The drug consists of three different monoclonal antibodies, human-made antibodies designed to mimic those produced naturally during an immune response. One gums up structures on the Ebola virus that allow it to infiltrate human cells, while the other two recruit immune cells to clear out the virus and infected cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Saphire, who heads a research consortium focused on studying antibody treatments for Ebola, says that given the drug’s two-pronged approach to fighting the virus, “the Regeneron cocktail is exactly the sort of complementary approach our research predicted would be most efficacious.” (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is a major financial supporter of the Society for Science &amp;amp; the Public, which publishes &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Inmazeb, which is delivered intravenously, has been used to treat patients in the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Congo under compassionate use protocols. The new FDA approval will remove regulatory hurdles, Saphire says, allowing local doctors and medical aid groups like Doctors Without Borders to more easily obtain the drug from national stockpiles in the United States and deploy them in affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In July, Regeneron and the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority announced an agreement whereby the company would &lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.regeneron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/barda-procures-regenerons-regn-eb3-investigational-ebola&quot;&gt;produce Inmazeb for a national stockpile&lt;/a&gt; over the next six years.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/globular-star-cluster-surprising-few-heavy-elements"/>

		<updated>2020-10-15T14:58:52+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A strange, newly measured clump of stars orbiting the nearby Andromeda galaxy has the lowest level of heavy chemical elements ever seen in one of these mysterious star clusters. Named RBC EXT8, this globular cluster &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abb1970&quot;&gt;is also surprisingly massive&lt;/a&gt;, challenging theories for how such clusters and some galaxies form, astronomers report online October 15 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a very unusual object,” says astrophysicist Oleg Gnedin of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who was not involved in the new discovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Globular clusters are crowded, spherical collections of stars that orbit a galaxy’s center, though most, including RBC EXT8, live in the galactic outskirts. The clusters are typically billions of years old, so their stars tend to be chemically pristine, meaning they formed before the universe had time to create much of any of the elements heavier than hydrogen or helium, which astronomers lump together as “metals.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous observations of these clusters in the Milky Way and other galaxies had suggested that there’s a limit to how low a globular cluster’s metal content can be. The most metal-poor clusters were about 300 times less rich in heavy elements like iron than the sun, but no less.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But spectra of RBC EXT8, some 2.5 million light-years away, show that the cluster’s metal content is about 800 times less than the sun’s. The globular cluster that held the previous record for lowest “metallicity” has three times that amount.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was completely unexpected that we would find a globular cluster that is so metal poor,” says astronomer Søren Larsen of Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;RBC EXT8&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3092385&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/101420_lg_globular-cluster_inline_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3092385&quot;&gt;The bigger, fuzzy blob in the inset image at left is RBC EXT8, a globular cluster that orbits about 88,000 light-years from the center of the galaxy Andromeda (shown at right). The cluster has surprisingly few heavy elements for its size, a new study finds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3092385&quot;&gt;© 2020 ESASky, CFHT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, given its metal-poor status, this cluster is surprisingly massive, weighing about 1.14 million times the mass of the sun. (A mid-weight globular cluster is about 100,000 solar masses, but some clusters reach 3 million solar masses. RBC EXT8 is heavy, but not the heaviest.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That mass makes the cluster even harder to explain because across the cosmos, the more massive a galaxy or cluster is, the more heavy elements it normally has.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are several potential explanations for that trend, but one is simply that more massive galaxies or globular clusters have more stars. A star fuses heavy elements in its core and sprinkles them around its host cluster or galaxy as it ages. Sufficiently massive stars can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/exploding-stars-scattered-traces-iron-over-antarctic-snow&quot;&gt;explode in a supernova&lt;/a&gt;, spreading those metals to become part of the next generation of stars (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/9/19&lt;/em&gt;). So more stars means more opportunity for metals to accumulate locally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More massive objects also have the advantage of gravity, which lets them better hold on to the metals that they do have and remain a cohesive group for billions of years. Less massive globular clusters dissolve into their host galaxies over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those trends together could have explained the apparent “metallicity floor” for globular clusters — all of the less massive, more metal-poor clusters have broken apart over the eons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RBC EXT8 turns that conventional wisdom on its head. “It’s too big to have as low metallicity as it has,” Gnedin says. “That’s the conundrum.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Astronomers aren’t sure how globular clusters form in general, but they probably grow within galaxies, rather than forming outside of them and being pulled in later. And so the clusters reflect the characteristics of their galaxies: small, metal-poor galaxies end up with small metal-poor globular clusters, and vice versa. But based on RBC EXT8’s metal content, it’s galactic birthplace would be less than a million solar masses, so smaller than the globular cluster itself – which is a paradox.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, the cluster challenges some simplified models of galaxy formation. But it doesn’t completely break them, Gnedin says. “It’s one object, it’s not going to overturn things,” he says. “It just makes us people working on these issues have to work harder” and be more open-minded about other ways that galaxies could form.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Open-mindedness and willingness to explore is perhaps responsible for the new finding about RBC EXT8’s metals. Larsen and colleagues spotted the globular cluster at the beginning of a night of observing with the Keck telescope in Hawaii in October 2019. “It was really a serendipitous discovery,” he says. He had a spare hour before the globular clusters in galaxy M33 that his team was planning to look at rose above the horizon, so the observers picked another cluster “more or less at random” to fill the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At first, I couldn’t really believe that what was coming out [in the observations] was right,” Larsen says. “But I kept working on it, and it turned out to hold up.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt; readers now have a faster way to find articles relevant to their interests. From an article abstract page, readers can simply activate the CORE Recommender to find additional open access research on similar topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Recommender, part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXivLabs&lt;/a&gt; toolset, was developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;CORE&lt;/a&gt;, a global aggregator of open access scientific content, which provides access to millions of full texts. CORE’s mission is to aggregate all open access research outputs from repositories and journals worldwide and make them available to the public. In this way, CORE facilitates free unrestricted access to research for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate a list of recommended works, the tool utilizes an algorithm based on the article’s full text and metadata, including title, authors, and abstract. The suggestions come both from arXiv and other resources in the CORE collection, and as many as five articles with freely accessible full texts might be recommended. A detailed explanation and discussion of the algorithm, by CORE founder Petr Knoth and his coauthors, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00578&quot;&gt;available on arXiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These recommendations benefit readers, who will access relevant information more quickly, and authors, whose open access content will become more visible to interested readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am very excited about this partnership as arXiv and CORE are both fully embracing the same vision of openness to research for all,” said Petr Knoth, founder and head of CORE. “This partnership will further improve open access infrastructure. It will help arXiv users to discover open access research papers relevant to their work from across the whole network of open access repositories.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are happy to welcome CORE to the arXivLabs family,” said arXiv executive director Eleonora Presani, “and we believe the Recommender will help arXiv users discover the content most relevant to their research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv values openness, community, and the privacy of user data and only works with partners that abide by the same principles. Like all third party collaborators, CORE will only have access to minimal and anonymized data about arXiv users, and only for the purpose of ensuring the correct functioning of the arXivLabs features. Any other use not included in a written consent from arXiv is strictly prohibited. Upon user request this data, and another other data connected to the user can be permanently deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; By guest blogger &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sofia_deleniv&quot;&gt;Sofia Deleniv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most people — even the non-psychologists among us — have at some point heard of the legendary marshmallow test, which measures the ability of preschool children to wait for a sweet treat. Researchers have found that the amount of time children are willing to wait for their marshmallow is &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.54.4.687&quot;&gt;surprisingly predictive of various life outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, such as educational attainment during adolescence, as well as social competence and resilience to stress throughout development. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21876169&quot;&gt;recent fMRI brain scan study&lt;/a&gt; even found that people’s performance as kids is related to their ability to suppress their impulses, and is reflected in neurological signatures of cognitive control, 40 years later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The test is clearly tapping into something crucial that shapes children’s futures to a considerable degree. But what exactly is it? Does the test  capture an ability that is akin to intelligence or intrinsic cognitive control, or might performance be a marker of &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797619839045&quot;&gt;some other underlying factor&lt;/a&gt; — such as the privilege of living in a supportive home where children can develop the trust capacity that enables them to wait for a reward?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The list of potential explanations is long — and now it has received a surprising new addition from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620939940&quot;&gt;study recently published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Fengling Ma from Zhejiang Sci-Tech University and colleagues have discovered that children can radically improve their performance on the marshmallow test if they believe their social reputation might be at stake — an effect that begins to emerge as early as three years of age.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40544&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1971-02138-001&quot;&gt;original experiments&lt;/a&gt;, conducted at Stanford University in the 1970s, preschool-age children were left in a room with a highly desired treat (e.g. a cookie or marshmallow), and a less appealing one — oftentimes a pretzel. They received the following offer: if they could wait for fifteen minutes on their own, they could eat their favourite treat. If the wait became unbearably long, they could always bring back the experimenter. But then they could only have the less exciting snack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Waiting the full fifteen minutes is a challenge, especially if the treats are tauntingly on full display. Children participating in the original experiment waited an average of just over three minutes under these conditions. And the recent study found that waiting was just as difficult for more than 270 three- and four-year-olds from preschools in one Chinese city. In these experiments, children were asked to choose between a single instantaneous reward (a colourful sticker or a cookie), and double the reward if they waited quarter of an hour. Under baseline conditions, fewer than 25% of children had the patience to make it to the end.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this figure dramatically changed in two other conditions, where children were made aware of the possibility that their performance might affect their reputation. Here, the experimenter told each child that either their teacher or friend would find out how long they ended up waiting for their reward. This had a radical impact on behaviour: 40% of children waited till the end when they thought their performance would be communicated to a peer, while almost 70% did so when they believed their teacher would find out about their wait.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results are interesting given that the experimenter did not explicitly mention to the children that waiting longer was a desirable behaviour. Instead, kids seemed to understand that patience is a socially valued attribute, and adjusted their behaviour in the hopes of being perceived favourably by other people. The fact that children waited longer when their teacher, as opposed to peer, was their theoretical spectator is intriguing. It implies that children as young as three can make sophisticated judgements about the value of their audience and strategically alter their behaviour to impress them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact that a desire for social recognition radically improved children’s performance offers us much food for thought. For years, many researchers have assumed that the key to the marshmallow test’s ability to predict children’s future success lay in its ability to measure their cognitive control. There is, after all, clear value in being able to suppress impulses in favour of more deliberative behaviours. Alternatively, some researchers have argued, the test taps into some other cognitive skill that might have been shaped by a child’s environment. In this debate, largely centred on cognitive abilities, “soft” social skills have perhaps taken a backseat. And yet the new study points at a new, and previously unsuspected, ingredient of good marshmallow test performance: a child’s awareness of the behaviours people value, such as patience, might be just as important. Perhaps it is the marshmallow test’s ability to tap into social perceptiveness that holds the key to this simple test’s ability to predict future success, time and time again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620939940&quot;&gt;Delay of Gratification as Reputation Management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;There’s no one way to be a mathematical genius.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shakuntala Devi had little formal education. Maryam Mirzakhani attended graduate school at Harvard University. Two films chronicle how each woman became famous for her own variety of mathematical prowess.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two women’s skills took vastly different forms: Devi was known for her blazingly fast mental arithmetic, while Mirzakhani made strides in the mathematics of surfaces, becoming the first woman to win one of the highest honors bestowed on mathematicians, the Fields Medal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The contrast between the two women is echoed in the divergent styles of the two films: One is a Bollywood biopic heavy on emotional drama, and the other is a documentary replete with mathematical lingo.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Born in India in 1929, Devi grew up in an impoverished family. As recounted in the Hindi-language film &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Shakuntala-Devi-Vidya-Balan/dp/B08D71WWXD&quot;&gt;Shakuntala Devi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, available with subtitles on Amazon Prime, she could make complex mental calculations at a rapid-fire pace, even as a small child. Devi became a performer, touring internationally and stunning observers with her feats, which outpaced computers in the 1970s and ’80s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While fun, the movie features bouts of cheesy dialog that may be off-putting to some viewers. But others will enjoy the scenes that re-create some of Devi’s most famous achievements, such as taking the 23rd root of a 201-digit number in under a minute, and multiplying two 13-digit numbers in less than 30 seconds. Careful viewers might be able to glean a few number facts from the film, but the movie focuses on Devi’s fraught relationships — particularly with her daughter — rather than on the details of mental math algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Watch the trailer for &lt;em&gt;Shakuntala Devi&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zalafilms.com/secrets/&quot;&gt;Secrets of the Surface&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, available on the online video platform Vimeo, recounts Mirzakhani’s life via interviews with her friends, teachers and colleagues. Although Mirzakhani preferred reading to mathematics at first, her mathematical talent soon became apparent. As a high school student in Iran in the 1990s, she twice won gold medals in the International Mathematical Olympiad. But aside from the youthful mathematical interests Devi and Mirzakhani shared, the two women’s backgrounds couldn’t be more different. Mirzakhani attended a high school for gifted girls and studied mathematics at Sharif University of Technology in Tehran before heading to Harvard and eventually a professorship at Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mirzakhani’s work focused on the geometry of surfaces, such as doughnuts with multiple holes. Her work has connections to other fields such as string theory, the mathematics-intensive branch of physics that attempts to describe the universe as composed of tiny, vibrating strings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The film includes beautifully clear descriptions and visualizations — for example, lines winding around a doughnut shape illustrate Mirzakhani’s study of the number of closed loops that can form on various curved surfaces. These visual aids elucidate the complicated mathematical concepts underlying Mirzakhani’s work, for which she won the Fields Medal in 2014. Three years after receiving that honor, Mirzakhani died of cancer at just 40 years old. In the film, interviews with students at her former high school reveal what an inspirational figure she still is. “I think she’s raised the bar for girls, but beside that, she has opened up a new way,” says student Dorsa Majdi. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Watch the trailer for &lt;em&gt;Secrets of the Surface&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Devi likewise inspired schoolchildren, promoting math as fun and unintimidating and authoring books about numbers. Watching the two films, I couldn’t help but wonder how Devi’s life might have been different had she been privileged with the type of schooling Mirzakhani received. In the biopic’s depiction, Devi seems to yearn for such an opportunity. She is portrayed staring longingly at children attending a school at which she is paid to perform, but which she can’t afford to attend.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seagrass-restoration-project-virginia-ecosystem-rapid-recovery"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3092342</id>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;In the world’s largest seagrass restoration project, scientists have observed an ecosystem from birth to full flowering.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As part of a 20-plus-years project, researchers and volunteers spread more than 70 million eelgrass seeds over plots covering more than 200 hectares, just beyond the wide expanses of salt marsh off the southern end of Virginia’s Eastern Shore. Long-term monitoring of the restored seagrass beds reveals a remarkably hardy ecosystem that is trapping carbon and nitrogen that would otherwise contribute to global warming and pollution, the team reports October 7 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances.&lt;/em&gt; That success provides a glimmer of hope for the climate and for ecosystems, the researchers say&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The project, led by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and The Nature Conservancy, has now grown to cover 3,612 hectares — and counting — in new seagrass beds. By comparison, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.environment.sa.gov.au/topics/coasts/explore-and-learn/seagrass-restoration-in-sa&quot;&gt;largest such project in Australia&lt;/a&gt; aims to restore 10 hectares of seagrass.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results are “a game changer,” says Carlos Duarte. “It’s an exemplar of how nature-based solutions can help mitigate climate change,” he says. The marine ecologist at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia is a leader in recognizing the carbon-storing capacity of mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team in Virginia started with a blank slate, says Robert Orth, a marine biologist at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in Gloucester Point. The seagrass in these inshore lagoons had been wiped out by disease and a hurricane in the early 1930s, but the water was still clear enough to transmit the sunlight plants require.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;researcher collecting seagrass seeds&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3092344&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/100720_JP_seagrass_inline1_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3092344&quot;&gt;A researcher collects seeds from a restored seagrass meadow in a coastal Virginia bay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3092344&quot;&gt;Jay Fleming&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within the first 10 years of restoration, Orth and colleagues witnessed an ecosystem rebounding rapidly across almost every indicator of ecosystem health — seagrass coverage, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seagrasses-boost-ecosystem-health-fighting-bad-bacteria&quot;&gt;water quality&lt;/a&gt;, carbon and nitrogen storage, and invertebrate and fish biomass (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/16/17&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, the team monitored how much carbon and nitrogen the meadows were capturing from the environment and storing in the sediment as seagrass coverage expanded. It found that meadows in place for nine or more years stored, on average, 1.3 times more carbon and 2.2 times more nitrogen than younger plots, suggesting that storage capacity increases as meadows mature. Within 20 years, the restored plots were accumulating carbon and nitrogen at rates similar to what natural, undisturbed seagrass beds in the same location would have stored. The restored seagrass beds are now sequestering on average about 3,000 metric tons of carbon per year and more than 600 metric tons of nitrogen, the researchers report.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Seagrasses can take a hit. When a sudden marine heat wave killed off a portion of the seagrass, it took just three years for the meadow to fully recover its plant density. “It surprised us how resilient these seagrass meadows were,” says Karen McGlathery, a coastal ecologist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She believes the team’s work is more than just a great case study in restoration. It “offers a blueprint for restoring and maintaining healthy seagrass ecosystems” that others can adapt elsewhere in the world, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Reestablished eelgrass bed near Virginia&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3092346&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/100720_JP_seagrass_inline2_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3092346&quot;&gt;Reestablished eelgrass beds off Virginia not only store carbon efficiently, they also support rich biodiversity, such as the seahorse seen here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3092346&quot;&gt;VIMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seagrasses are among the world’s most valuable and most threatened ecosystems, and are important globally as reservoirs of what’s known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/blue-carbon&quot;&gt;blue carbon&lt;/a&gt;, the carbon stored in ocean and coastal ecosystems. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/report/out-blue-value-seagrasses-environment-and-people&quot;&gt;Seagrass&lt;/a&gt; meadows are among the most efficient storers of carbon on Earth, preventing carbon from escaping to the atmosphere as heat-trapping carbon dioxide. These underwater prairies also support near-shore and offshore fisheries, and protect coastlines as well as other marine habitats. Despite their importance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00617/full&quot;&gt;seagrasses have declined&lt;/a&gt; globally by some 30 percent since 1879, according to an Aug. 14 study in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Marine Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The study helps fill some large gaps in our understanding of how blue carbon can contribute to climate restoration,” says McGlathery. “It’s the first to put a number on how much carbon restored meadows take out of the atmosphere and store,” for decades and potentially for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The restoration is far from finished. But already, it may point the way for struggling ecosystems such as Florida’s Biscayne Bay, once rich in seagrass but now suffering from water quality degradation and widespread fish kills.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pollution-regulations-help-chesapeake-bay-seagrass-rebound&quot;&gt;Once the water is cleaned up&lt;/a&gt;, says Orth, “our work suggests that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pollution-regulations-help-chesapeake-bay-seagrass-rebound&quot;&gt;seagrasses can recover&lt;/a&gt; rapidly” (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/5/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;McGlathery also believes the scale of the team’s success should be uplifting for coastal communities. “In my first years here, there was no seagrass and there hadn’t been for decades. Today, as far as I can swim, I see lush meadows, rays, the occasional seahorse. It’s beautiful.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of us are aware of the vast inequality that exists in the world — and even if we’re not, exposure to that information can change how we behave. Research has found that we’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-27124-015&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more likely to take risks&lt;/a&gt; when exposed to inequality and that it can make high-income individuals &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-21998-002&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;less likely to be generous&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It can also change the way people feel about public policy, as Melissa L. Sands and Daniel de Kadt from the University of California, Merced find in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2763-1&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature. &lt;/em&gt;They explored real-world inequality in low-income neighbourhoods in South Africa — and found that visible reminders of unequal socioeconomic status can  raise support for taxation of the wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40535&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;South Africa, like many other countries, has high levels of inequality, largely related to apartheid and colonialism: World Bank &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/southafrica/overview&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;figures&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the top 1% of earners in South Africa own 71% of assets while the bottom 60% own just 7%. The study itself took place in Soweto, an area which has particularly low socioeconomic status both within the country and within its province, Gauteng. The average annual household income in the seven neighbourhoods in which the study took place is 32,000 rand — half the average annual income for Black South Africans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The methods were simple. Participants were approached by a petitioner, who either asked for support for a policy that would redistribute wealth through higher taxation of the wealthy or for a policy related to renewable energy. On some occasions, a BMW 3 Series was placed at the location; on others, the car was absent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, participants were 9% less likely to stop to sign either petition when the car was nearby. But after controlling for this baseline “suppressive effect”, the team found that  participants were actually 11% &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; likely to sign the wealth tax petition than the renewable energy one in the presence of the BMW. That is, the car, a reminder of inequality, seemed to increase support specifically for the issue of taxation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings strengthen the case of a 2015 survey, also analysed by the team, which also indicated that Soweto residents exposed to more inequality where they lived (e.g. those more likely to see signs of wealth within a kilometre of their home) were more likely to support higher taxation of the wealthy. This wasn’t the case when conspicuous signs of inequality were further away, visible within five or ten kilometres. This all suggests that visible markers of inequality make people more likely to want to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study didn’t explore the willingness of participants to engage in other acts of resistance, or the longevity of such actions. As Colin Tredoux and John Dixon point out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02526-8&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this op-ed&lt;/a&gt; about the study, signing a petition is an example of normative resistance — a pretty acceptable way of registering dissent. Whether displays of inequality would spur people onto more active protest would be interesting to explore, as would tracking how such feelings endure over time. And what of those with a higher income themselves? It’s unclear whether the presence of a fancy car would have the same effect on that group — so what might prompt them into supporting social policies that help the many?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further work could also look at the meaning local people ascribe to such displays of inequality. The team notes that Soweto is a site of serious racial stratification — and it’s difficult to untangle issues of race and colonialism from issues of income inequality. Does the car represent racial or class stratification, both or even neither? A follow-up survey may help delve deeper into these issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2763-1&quot;&gt;Local exposure to inequality raises support of people of low wealth for taxing the wealthy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The following press release was issued on Wednesday, October 14th at 12:01 Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — Jisc, the digital solutions provider for education and research in the UK, and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced two 3-year Open Access (OA) agreements that allow researchers to publish in PLOS journals without incurring article processing charges (APC). This is the first time that a large university consortium has provided collective agreements as an alternative to APCs at this scale. Jisc and PLOS will also collaborate on future data, metrics, and tools for institutions to evaluate OA publishing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Jisc has always been a priority partner, given its high profile, its large existing institutional account base with PLOS, and leadership role in the library community,” said Sara Rouhi, director of strategic partnerships for PLOS. “It’s always exciting to partner with a forward-leaning organization whose values and priorities around Open Access and Open Science align with our own. We also look forward to sharing the fruits of this partnership with the broader community.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-18471&quot; height=&quot;138&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/Jisc-Sq-Logo-2018-RGB-for-Digital.jpg&quot; width=&quot;138&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Caren Milloy, Jisc’s director of licensing, adds: “We are pleased to have reached these pioneering agreements with PLOS, which will make it easier for researchers to publish OA and offer affordability and sustainability to institutions. These collective action agreements have the potential to help shape the future of OA funding.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the flat fee agreement, which begins on January 1, 2021, annual fixed prices will cover uncapped publishing in five PLOS journals&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; for corresponding authors affiliated with participating Jisc institutions as well as custom reporting and collaboration on future reporting standards initiatives. The PLOS Community Action Publishing agreement, facilitates uncapped publishing in PLOS’ two highly selective journals&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftn2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; through a collective action model. Both corresponding and contributing authors affiliated with participating Jisc institutions are eligible. The model itself is predicated on cost recovery, capped margins, and redistributing revenues above target back to community members.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These agreements empower authors who want to participate in Open Access publishing, and support a diverse scholarly communication ecosystem for researchers and readers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; PLOS journals include &lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Pathogens, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Py94lQGyxhA/"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Digital Science and PLOS are pleased to announce an agreement which will provide PLOS, the leading Open Access (OA) publisher with access to Dimensions on BigQuery. Dimensions is a comprehensive database that covers the full research and innovation lifecycle. BigQuery, Google Cloud’s serverless and secure multi-cloud data warehouse, enables PLOS to analyse the full metadata of Dimensions and use it to inform strategy and decision-making across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This follows the recent Digital Science partnership with Google Cloud, which was designed to remove barriers to data access, analysis and visualization for organizations across the research and innovation ecosystem. In today’s environment, stakeholders in the research and innovation ecosystem are seeking to make better, evidence-based decisions. To do this, they need greater access to contextual information, while at the same time protecting the security of their own data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dimensions is a research information platform which has been developed to provide a comprehensive view on the research process and activities  – going beyond publications and citations. While covering 112 million publications with 1.2 billion citations, Dimensions also interlinks data from $1.8 trillion of funded grants, 583,000 clinical trials, 40 million patents, 453k policy documents and 1.5 million datasets. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS has been using Dimensions Analytics and the Dimensions API since early 2020, and is also an existing Google BigQuery user. This latest agreement therefore fits seamlessly with PLOS’s own data strategy, providing their staff Dimensions data on Google BigQuery to help shape their business development strategy, monitor trends in the OA landscape — such as providing evidence to support Open Access Transformative Agreements, and create custom dashboards and reports that can be securely accessed and shared across their organization. PLOS will now be able to combine their own internal data with Dimensions external data sources, helping create a 360° view of the research landscape.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kristen Monahan, Data &amp;amp; Insights Senior Manager, said:&lt;em&gt; – &lt;/em&gt;“PLOS already relies on Dimensions for baseline data about institutions and funding to assist in our agreement discussions and uses a combination of Dimensions and internal data for business analytics. Also having access to Dimensions data via Google BigQuery gives us tremendous freedom to analyse and integrate Dimensions data across our organization.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Christian Herzog, CEO Dimensions, said: “We’re very pleased that, through this agreement, PLOS staff will get unprecedented access to the Dimensions database. This brings them full flexibility to perform advanced analytics at industry-leading speeds and create personalized dashboards and reports. More importantly, however, it brings them greater access to the contextual information in Dimensions that supports their thoughtful approach to informed, evidence-based decision-making.”&lt;/p&gt;

		<title type="html" xml:lang="en-US">Community Comments Continued: An update on the preprint commenting pilot at PLOS</title>
		<link href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/7U4Cr0nZ0d0/"/>
		<id>https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18464</id>
		<updated>2020-10-13T14:40:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around 11 months ago we announced our year-long  &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/&quot;&gt;preprint commenting pilot&lt;/a&gt; to connect bioRxiv comments on preprints that are under consideration at select PLOS journals to the editors handling those articles. (The journals in the pilot are &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have one month left on this pilot, and in the interest of making the most of this, we also want to hear from YOU, the open science community. Have you ever received public feedback on a preprint? Do you comment on preprints? Privately or publicly? Do you read preprints but feel that you can’t give feedback?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you answered yes to any of the above, we want to hear from you.  Tell us your preprint story &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbrdpufuZDrmfqvWgfjk8O0Renr3p75Ii1XlftPuYHWPOYkg/viewform&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we anticipated, during this pilot the majority of eligible preprints haven’t received any public comments on the bioRxiv platform. Staff facilitating this pilot have observed that, while some preprints receive high quality feedback in the comments, most do not. Also, the timing of preprint commenting has not always lined up with the peer review process, so that preprints have received detailed feedback after an editorial decision had already been made. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pilot programs provide an opportunity to take the ongoing temperature of the community regarding innovations in scholarly communication and researcher behaviors. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/833400v1.full&quot;&gt;2019 survey reported&lt;/a&gt; that 53% of preprint posters do so in order to receive feedback. So how should we interpret this slow uptake of commenting on the bioRxiv platform?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;328&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VncPSe15Um9uJHUwXTGO6vatdLGU55Qf-3XsfVcyJ2S053HSQ_vIeMXdtPNHFDqhtN58uaGMHWQEOZmUhbF9fYEKBa0wzm_JNhCFJh1OaSf3DZrbewR4KfqVNUHe_U4cs8CpuzxQ&quot; width=&quot;624&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We could easily assume that there just isn’t a lot of interest in preprint commenting. Yet a recent flash survey of reviewers across all the PLOS journals (not just the ones in this pilot) revealed that at least 11% of those surveyed had provided public feedback on a preprint. While a few reported giving private feedback, the majority of respondents told us that they read preprints but don’t comment on them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, ASAPbio &lt;a href=&quot;https://asapbio.org/biopreprints2020-survey-initial-results&quot;&gt;recently found&lt;/a&gt; that more than 50% of researchers indicate that the opportunity for early feedback on preprints was very beneficial, suggesting that authors could benefit from preprint commenting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the early stages of this pilot we already knew (from the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/833400v1.full&quot;&gt;2019 survey above&lt;/a&gt;) that researchers have reported a preference for private feedback, and that most researchers who &lt;em&gt;have &lt;/em&gt;received feedback have received it privately via email or conversation, or, if publicly, via Twitter. Our pilot, which only covered comments left on the bioRxiv platform, had no way of noting whether any comments were actually coming to the authors via other channels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we launched this pilot we also talked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/11/why-engage-with-preprints/&quot;&gt;why we engage with preprints&lt;/a&gt;. We see preprints as an important step towards opening up peer review to more voices beyond those expressly invited by the editors. Far from being a side-step around peer review, as some detractors see them, we see preprints as a way of getting &lt;strong&gt;even more&lt;/strong&gt; eyes, and therefore reviews, on an article undergoing peer review. As our Chief Scientific Officer, Veronique Kiermer, wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/transparency-and-trust-peer-review-week-2020/&quot;&gt;post during Peer Review Week&lt;/a&gt;, preprints maximize and diversify peer review in a way that the traditional process cannot, in a way that complements that traditional process and makes it even stronger. This is all “a celebration of peer review in different forms”!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we remain committed to providing greater opportunities for research communities to participate in reviews of preprints, while promoting transparency in peer review, but we will now consider how we could refine processes around facilitating engagement with preprints during the peer review process. We believe that maximizing and diversifying the voices involved in peer review is simply a behavior we must patiently cultivate, and we will use the lessons learned from the pilot to help us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remember, please complete the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbrdpufuZDrmfqvWgfjk8O0Renr3p75Ii1XlftPuYHWPOYkg/viewform&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;! We have one month of the pilot left to go, and we would like to complement our final report with the findings from this survey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, please watch this space for more posts about preprints, peer review, and all the ways in which we’re working with the research community to improve trust in science.&lt;/p&gt;

 Sometimes things get pretty meta around here.  Exhibit A: The journal Current Medical Chemistry has retracted a 2012 paper for plagiarizing from a 2011 article — and the senior authors of each article share the same last name.  Ho hum, you say. But that name is one that might be familiar to RW readers. Here’s … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/13/in-which-a-researcher-named-das-plagiarizes-from-another-researcher-named-das-one-with-20-retractions/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;In which a researcher named Das plagiarizes from another researcher named Das, one with 20 retractions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/13/how-well-do-you-know-yourself-research-on-self-insight-digested/"/>

		<updated>2020-10-13T08:57:40+00:00</updated>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“There are three things extremely hard: steel, a diamond, and to know one’s self.”&lt;/em&gt; – Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard’s Almanac, 1750.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Franklin was writing over 250 years ago. Surely we humans have learned strategies since then to aid self-insight — and avoid well-known pitfalls. Most of us are familiar, for example, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/435685/&quot;&gt;better-than-average effect,&lt;/a&gt; the finding that most of us rank ourselves above average at everything from driving ability to desirable personality traits (even though of course we can’t all be right). So armed with this kind of knowledge, are we better placed now to view ourselves accurately? And if not, how can we get better at this — and what benefits can we expect?  The following studies provide some illuminating answers…&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40514&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel like I’m smarter than other people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The better-than-average effect may be old news, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/24/first-survey-of-its-kind-for-50-years-finds-most-americans-still-think-they-have-above-average-intelligence/&quot;&gt;results from a recent systematic survey of Americans’ beliefs about their own intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (the first to be conducted in 50 years) found that about 70% of men and 60% of women agreed with the statement: “I am more intelligent than the average person.” The team was forced to conclude that Americans’ “self-flattering beliefs about intelligence are alive and well several decades after their discovery was first reported.” Other work has found that our over-estimates of our intelligence can be staggeringly huge — around &lt;em&gt;30&lt;/em&gt; IQ points, on average, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289618302150&quot;&gt;according to a study by Gilles Gignac and Marcin Zajenkowski&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289618302150&quot;&gt;published last year&lt;/a&gt; (which also found that we tend to over-estimate our romantic partner’s intelligence even more than our own). The sobering lesson is that you’re probably a lot less smart than you think are.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK, but I at least know the limits of my knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123855220000056?via=ihub&quot;&gt; “Dunning-Kruger effect” &lt;/a&gt;relates specifically to the tendency of people who are poor at a task to over-estimate their ability at it. As David Dunning has written: “The scope of people’s ignorance is often invisible to them.” (Although see Gignac and Zajenkowski again, with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/y52m6ddb&quot;&gt;paper from this year&lt;/a&gt; arguing that the effect is (mostly) a statistical artefact).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; This over-confidence can be dangerous both to the individual, and to others. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/204605797.pdf&quot;&gt;a US study of student pilots&lt;/a&gt; found that those who’d scored lower on a pilot knowledge test “grossly overestimated their ability” while higher-scoring students tended in fact to under-estimate theirs. The same effect has been noted among other groups such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/RP/C7RP00168A#!divAbstract&quot;&gt;chemistry students&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, students who’d scored less than 50% on one exam had predicted that they’d get an average of 69%, while their actual average mark was just under 37%. That’s a massive discrepancy. If you don’t know that you’re under-prepared for a test, this is clearly a problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fine. But you can’t deny that I know who I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How well do you know your own personality as it fluctuates from moment to moment? &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/03/most-of-us-have-some-insight-into-our-personality-traits-but-how-self-aware-are-we-in-the-moment/&quot;&gt;This was explored in a recent study&lt;/a&gt;, which found that participants had self-insight into their momentary levels of extraversion and conscientiousness, but weren’t great at rating how agreeable they were being at any given time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797618818476&quot;&gt;As the researchers write&lt;/a&gt;: “This apparent self-ignorance may be partly responsible for interpersonal problems”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, when it comes to personality in general — your fairly stable, trait levels of extraversion, agreeableness, and so on — there’s some rare good news when it comes to self-insight. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797618810000&quot;&gt;a large-scale review of data on self-reports of personality vs personality ratings from others&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; in 2018, we’re actually pretty good at judging ourselves in this way. In fact, the work revealed that if anything, we’re harsher judges of our personality than other people are. This was a surprise to the researchers, who’d assumed, based on other work in this field, to find a positive self-bias.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But I know what I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt;, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you love salt and vinegar crisps, say, but hate cheese and onion, then fair enough. No one’s going to argue that you’re mistaken. But if you tell me you &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; coffee, I might be less accepting. It turns out that it’s not always that easy for us to tell the difference between &lt;em&gt;liking&lt;/em&gt; something and &lt;em&gt;wanting&lt;/em&gt; it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/22/heavy-coffee-drinkers-want-coffee-a-lot-more-than-they-actually-like-it/&quot;&gt; A study published this&lt;/a&gt; year found that “heavy” coffee drinkers (people who drank three or more cups a day) actually want coffee a lot more than they like it. The implication is that they drink it mostly or entirely to feed their addiction, rather than for pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I get better at knowing myself?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, the people around you could be more honest: in general, other people don’t help us to correct our biases. Too often, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691613518075&quot;&gt;feedback from employers, family, and friends is vague, and overly positive&lt;/a&gt;, according to research led by Zlatan Krizan at Iowa State University. “As a society, we make the wrong trade-off by thinking that boosting self-esteem is going to boost performance, and that rarely happens,” Krizan says. “That empty praise of telling someone they’re great, or pretending there are not skill differences when there are, can really become a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As well as seeking honest feedback, and bearing in mind the better-than-average effect, it could also be worth practising humility. Research published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Self and Identity &lt;/em&gt;suggests that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/01/07/some-people-think-they-know-themselves-well-but-do-they-really/&quot;&gt;people who are more modest about their degree of self-knowledge actually know themselves better&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But is it important to have accurate self-knowledge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No one likes a narcissist. But there could be some benefits to thinking you’re better than you are. They relate to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211011912&quot;&gt;optimism bias&lt;/a&gt; — the fact that we tend to over-estimate the likelihood of positive events in our lives, like getting a top promotion, and under-estimate our chances of suffering everything from a divorce to a car crash. Optimism is important for mental and physical health. So perhaps having inflated self-views is important for our wellbeing, too. In fact, according to the results of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0644-0&quot;&gt;study published last year in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this may well be the case. The participants completed various tests of cognitive and emotional abilities and then reported how well they thought they’d done on all these tests. They then spent a week completing daily diaries, in which they reflected on their levels of satisfaction with their career, relationships and life in general.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that having accurate self-insight was not related to higher levels of satisfaction in any of these areas. The data even suggested that people who most over-estimated their abilities had the highest levels of life satisfaction. Still, it’s worth noting that feeling great about your life and performing to your highest level are two different things. People with accurate self-knowledge may be more driven to improve, and achieve more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A word of caution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; Our understanding of the potential pluses or minuses of accurate self-insight is, according to a recent review, “clouded” by all kinds of issues, including differences between studies in the way self-insight is measured, and also fundamental differences in types of self-deception. (Self-deception may sometimes stem from an individual’s desire to defend their self-esteem, but other times exist simply because a person hasn’t really engaged in close self-assessment.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331983635_The_advantages_and_disadvantages_of_self-insight_New_psychological_and_neural_perspectives&quot;&gt;Jennifer Beer and Michelle Harris write&lt;/a&gt; that the currently available research “does not allow us to confidently conclude that self-insight has advantages over some types of self-insight failure (or vice versa).” They conclude by calling for “more systematic investigation of why, when, where and for whom self-insight is costly or beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt;

		<title type="html" xml:lang="en-US">Implementing name changes for published transgender authors</title>
		<link href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/ti9zhDfMr0M/"/>
		<id>https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18453</id>
		<updated>2020-10-12T14:41:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;At PLOS we are committed to addressing the needs of all research communities to improve diversity, equity and inclusion. One of the concerns for some of our transgender and non-binary authors is around changes to their names and how these are reflected in the academic record. In particular, the names assigned to transgender or non-binary persons at birth can represent a stigma, and these names are sometimes referred to as deadnames. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although authors can change their name on their ORCiD profiles themselves, changes to their published academic record have been difficult to implement since, traditionally, changes are limited to correcting author or publisher errors. We believe there is no reason for this to be a barrier. Publishing an academic study is an achievement for researchers to be proud of, and it is important that the name on the paper reflects who the authors are. Therefore, across all PLOS journals we will now honor requests from transgender and non-binary authors of published papers to update their names. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The relevant papers will be “republished”, meaning that they will be fully replaced online, and that their indexing metadata (which affects how the author list appears in PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, etc.) should subsequently be updated accordingly. This replaces the author name fully, yet ensures that citation information such as the DOI for the paper remains the same. All previous citations to the paper remain valid. To maintain the author’s privacy, no notice of the name change will be attached to the replaced paper. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We strive to support our authors and address issues around equality and inclusion, and welcome any enquiries from transgender authors interested in updating names on their past publications. There is no requirement for authors to do so, this is entirely at their discretion. To initiate this process, simply email us at the relevant journal office. What matters to us is the person who authored the paper, and we want to ensure that the published academic record reflects their correct identity.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authors: Ruth Schmidt is an Associate Professor at IIT’s Institute of Design and Anna Hatch is the program director for&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;DORA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. PLOS supports DORA financially via organizational membership, and PLOS is represented on the steering committee of DORA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making/&quot;&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt; of our series we showed how objective comparisons are not equitable. In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making-part-ii/&quot;&gt;second part&lt;/a&gt; of this series we showed how individual data points can accidentally distract from the whole. Now in part 3 we explore how we gauge value by association.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While we often give individual data points too much weight, we also face a related, but distinct, tendency to see patterns where they may not exist, or to apply less-than-sound mental models to define the relationships between items. This means that our interpretations of future likelihoods, personal abilities, and relative importance are often skewed, which in turn can impact how we judge risk or prioritize options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the &lt;strong&gt;Halo effect&lt;/strong&gt; also contributes to this tendency, as seen in cases where highly rated or prominent institutions and journals (and individuals associated with them) receive the benefit of the doubt based on reputation. While this associative property can feel like a useful shortcut, it can cause decision-makers to overlook or override important data that should give us pause. For example, noting that an applicant shares one’s alma mater or trained under one’s former mentor might unfairly bolster their reputation based on factors that have little to do with the quality of their own work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another classic behavioraleconomics concept known as&lt;strong&gt; Availability&lt;/strong&gt; is equally relevant. This describes our tendency to fall back on or place a higher weight on anecdotal, top-of-mind, or easily recalled data when making choices. In doing so, availability reduces our power to be fair-minded and equitable, because we end up dismissing other important evidence and missing the bigger picture. Availability can occur when individual or memorable anecdotes are prioritized in academic assessment, like overweighting a single experience or leaning too heavily on someone’s anecdotal recollection to inform a hiring decision. It can also lead to over-valuing recent data, like getting a well-known grant, instead of pursuing a fuller picture of scholarly productivity that would yield a more well-rounded decision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can institutions do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structured information gathering.&lt;/strong&gt; These tendencies are more likely to occur when there’s no formal mechanism to gather data, increasing the likelihood individual memories or perceptions will dominate judgment and decision-making. The use of structured formats, like interview protocols and narrative format CVs, can keep decision-makers focused on agreed-upon qualities rather than on the vagaries of individual interactions and reflections and also ensure greater consistency of information across candidates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Force long-term thinking.&lt;/strong&gt; Short-term thinking tends to come more naturally than planning for the future, which means that the attributes we consider important are often more oriented toward immediacy over the longer term. Explicitly articulating and considering longitudinal values and goals, in addition to short-term needs, can help decision-makers concretize the potential outcomes, both pro and con, of decisions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contextualizing narratives&lt;/strong&gt;. Traditional CVs are not known for their ability to demonstrate the big picture. Asking applicants to provide supplemental narratives that highlight and articulate their most meaningful contributions can convert commonly used shortcut characteristics for quality and productivity into more human form. This can re-center the conversation around&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03696-w&quot;&gt; research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03696-w&quot;&gt;impact&lt;/a&gt; that extends beyond citations and academic circles to include demonstrable real-world change and improved outcomes, and provide concrete definition to otherwise vague terms like “world-class” and “significant contribution.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our final installment next week, we’ll call out how incumbent processes and perceptions have the advantage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To encourage the adoption of more equitable hiring, and RPT processes, the authors are collaborating on a series of tools for DORA to assist institutions in experimenting with new processes, indicators, and principles.

		<updated>2020-10-12T08:48:58+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Countless studies have investigated how a leader’s behaviour influences their followers. There’s been very little work, though, on the reverse: how followers might influence their leaders. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-70962-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Psychology,&lt;/em&gt; helps to plug that gap with an alarming finding: good, morally upstanding followers can create&lt;em&gt; less&lt;/em&gt; ethical leaders.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40497&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;M. Ghufran Ahmad at the Lahore University of Management Sciences and colleagues ran a series of studies on participants in an executive training programme at a business school in Pakistan. All were senior or mid-level managers, from a variety of organisations. These, then, were the “leaders”. The people that they managed were the “followers”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an initial study, the team found that the more a participant felt that their followers engaged in “organizational citizenship behaviour” (OCB) — such as going out of their way to be “good” to other employees — the more “moral credit” that leader felt they had personally accrued. The concept of moral credit relates to the theory that we each balance good and bad behaviours, to maintain a kind of moral equilibrium. A good deed ups our moral credit, while a bad one depletes that credit. While this phenomenon has been found for individuals, it’s thought to &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-14075-001&quot;&gt;apply to groups, too&lt;/a&gt;: if one member behaves morally, others can feel licensed to behave less well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team then ran follow-up online studies on fresh batches of participants. These revealed that when a leader was encouraged either to feel more narcissistic (in this case, more responsible for their group’s success) &lt;em&gt;or &lt;/em&gt;to identify with their followers (by reflecting on characteristics that they shared with their group, for example), they were especially likely to feel that their own moral credit had risen as a result of good behaviour by their followers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These studies all involved experimental manipulations and vignettes, however. And they didn’t tackle the critical question: can vicarious moral credit free leaders to actually behave more badly?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To get closer to a real-world scenario, the team ran a field study involving 250 managers, all again from the same course. These participants completed four online surveys over two days. They reported on follower OCBs, the extent to which they identified with their followers, their perceived levels of moral credit, levels of narcissism and also any unethical behaviour that they themselves engaged in — such as doing personal business on company time or passing blame for errors to an innocent coworker.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that these leaders were indeed more likely to behave badly when they felt themselves to be in moral credit as a result of good behaviour by their subordinates. Tallying with the earlier findings, this effect was especially strong when leaders were narcissistic and/or closely identified with their followers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Across multiple studies, our findings indicate that follower OCB can provide leaders with moral credit to engage in subsequent unethical behaviour,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If good teams can foster unethical behaviour among leaders, this insight is relevant to all kinds of organisations, not just businesses. It’s important, too, that leaders who felt closer to the people that they managed were even more susceptible to the effect. As the researchers write: “Our findings provide further support for the notion that close relationships between leaders and followers are not always a good thing”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are a few caveats. One, the studies were all conducted in Pakistan, which, the team notes, is more collectivistic than the UK or US, for example. Similar studies in other countries will be needed to explore whether these findings hold in more individualistic cultures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clearly much more work is needed to explore the extent to which leaders actually use moral credit to engage in bad deeds in the workplace, or at home, or elsewhere — and over what kind of timescales. Also, what might temper the effect? Are leaders who see themselves as “good people” less susceptible to it, perhaps? And how does each individual’s good or bad behaviour influence the others in the group? If we each have a moral equilibrium, an individual who performs a good deed will surely then feel licensed to behave less well themselves — but does the behaviour of their manager have any impact? There are all sorts of outstanding questions that new studies in this area will hopefully answer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-70962-001&quot;&gt;Can good followers create unethical leaders? How follower citizenship leads to leader moral licensing and unethical behavior.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to get on a cat’s good side, it’s worth mastering the art of the “slow blink”. &lt;/strong&gt;Cats “smile” by blinking slowly, and now researchers have found that they respond positively to humans who do the same. Participants who performed a slow blink were more likely to receive one from their cat, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/want-to-make-friends-with-a-cat-blink-slowly-say-scientists/&quot;&gt;reports Sara Rigby&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus&lt;/em&gt;. Cats were also more likely to approach an experimenter who had just slow-blinked. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40483&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The idea that people in big cities are less likely to help strangers seems to be a myth. &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers conducted experiments across 24 UK towns and cities in which they planted “lost” letters and items, or attempted to cross the road. There was no link between population density and people’s willingness to help out by returning items or stopping to let the experimenter cross, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/07/big-city-indifference-to-strangers-may-be-a-myth-study-suggests&quot;&gt;reports Natalie Grover&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scared of ghosts? Maybe science can help put you at ease.&lt;/strong&gt; At &lt;em&gt;Popular Science&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsci.com/story/science/ghosts-real-science/&quot;&gt;Jake Bittle looks at&lt;/a&gt; the various psychological and physiological mechanisms that can explain why people report seeing apparitions, from basic human suggestibility to the effects of psychedelic mould.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it feels like you are living in a political bubble, you’re not alone: a recent survey found that 40% of Americans don’t have a close friend who is voting for a presidential candidate other than the one they prefer. &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/why-friendships-are-falling-apart-over-politics-146821&quot;&gt;Melanie Green argues&lt;/a&gt; that social media is partly to blame for this polarisation, as is the increasing tendency to tie our individual identity to our political views.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s probably unsurprising to learn that many of us have reported feeling deprived of touch during lockdown. &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;, Claudia Hammond &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201006-why-touch-matters-more-than-ever-in-the-time-of-covid-19&quot;&gt;takes a look at the studies&lt;/a&gt; that have explored the importance of human touch to our wellbeing, both before and during the pandemic. And don’t forget to check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/09/02/episode-21-how-to-stay-connected-in-the-new-normal/&quot;&gt;our recent podcast&lt;/a&gt; on staying connected in the “new normal”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much can we really learn about someone’s internal states based on their body language? &lt;/strong&gt;There’s a small industry of analysts who claim to be able to understand how a person is thinking or feeling based on specific gestures. But psychologists are sceptical, &lt;a href=&quot;https://undark.org/2020/10/07/body-language-analysis/&quot;&gt;writes Ramin Skibba&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Undark&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apes engage in “playful teasing” just like human toddlers, responding to requests in bizarre ways or playing silly games. &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/10/playful-teasing-apes-could-provide-clues-evolutionary-roots-early-humor&quot;&gt;Lucy Hicks talks to anthropologist Erica Cartmill&lt;/a&gt; about the implications of this behaviour for understanding the evolutionary history of humour&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Getty images&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/Blog-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest aspects in taking care of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease is planning for future renal replacement needs, either dialysis or transplant options. The benefits of transplantation over dialysis are widely accepted and if someone is a medically cleared, they should be encouraged to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199912023412303&quot;&gt;pursue transplantation&lt;/a&gt;. Dialysis counseling and education is individualized for patients depending on their other medical conditions, support systems, and transplant candidacy.   For those patients that are cleared medically and have potential live donors, discussions about home dialysis training and permanent dialysis access are curtailed. The assumption that the time on dialysis will be short and therefore effort towards arteriovenous access creation or home dialysis training seems wasted. But is the wait time really that short?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-02080-5&quot;&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Dr. Slyvestre &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; report on 9300 incident dialysis patients listed and cleared for transplantation, and highlight the potential complications of catheter procedures or infections and associated increased risk of death during the wait time. Most striking was the median time to transplantation for both deceased donor recipients of 15 months and 9 months for those with live donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential year on dialysis therapy, even with potential donors, raises a few questions for nephrologists. Are we adequately preparing patients for that time on dialysis while they are waiting for workup and the potential delays? Should we be looking at the home dialysis options more? Are we putting patients at risk of a tunneled dialysis catheter infection that could have more significant complications such as disseminated infection requiring prolonged antibiotics or delay their surgery. The wait times also suggest perhaps a closer look at the process of workup for donors to see if there are ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajt.14732&quot;&gt;streamline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are we putting patients at risk of a tunneled dialysis catheter infection that could have more significant complications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a discussion with the patient’s transplant team to get a realistic time frame for the live donor surgery is going to be an important part of the decision making process. It will be a very different approach if a patient has a surgical date in 2 months versus a patient who has a potential donor but it is very early in the process. On the flip side, it would be important to share the information with patients so they are not getting discouraged with the wait times. Additionally, the decisions that they will make about dialysis options would be more informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This need is further amplified against the &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajt.16167&quot;&gt;backdrop of the COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; pandemic and it’s impact on transplantation. While healthcare systems around the world were overwhelmed by the influx of cases, there was a need to pause on “elective” procedures. Kidney transplantation rates fell as providers scrambled to balance the risk of immunosuppression and the risk of infection from COVID-19. The transplant evaluation process is further slowed by the inability to do in person visits for a multi-disclipinary team evaluation and delays in necessary testing for medical clearance as routine testing for things like mammograms and colonoscopy were on hold. Transplant centers are actively surveilling local rates of infections and mortality rates from COVID-19 and modifying evaluation and listing processes based on the resources available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is desire to move forward with transplantation, it needs to be done in a way to maintain the safety of donors and recipients. Nephrologists need to recognize the fluid nature of the transplantation process and help guide their patients through this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/10/08/getting-real-about-kidney-transplant-timelines/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Getting real about kidney transplant timelines&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;BMC Series blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/28/arxivlabs-a-space-for-community-innovation/&quot;&gt;arXivLabs&lt;/a&gt; launched a new Code tab, a shortcut linking Machine Learning articles with their associated code. arXivLabs provides a conduit for collaboration that invites community participation while allowing arXiv developers to focus on core services. This Code feature was developed by&lt;a href=&quot;https://paperswithcode.com/about&quot;&gt; Papers with Code&lt;/a&gt;, a free resource for researchers and practitioners to find and follow the latest Machine Learning papers and code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a reader activates the Code tool on the arXiv abstract record page, the author’s implementation of the code will be displayed in the tab, if available, as well as links to any community implementations. This instant access allows researchers to use and build upon the work quickly and easily, increasing code accessibility and accelerating the speed of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_710&quot; style=&quot;width: 924px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-1.34.57-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot of abstract page with code tab highlighted&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-710 size-full&quot; height=&quot;782&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-1.34.57-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;924&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Under the abstract on an arXiv record page, you can now find code.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors can also directly link code to their arXiv papers directly from their arXiv user page by clicking on the PwC icon next to the paper title. From there they will be directed to&lt;a href=&quot;https://paperswithcode.com/&quot;&gt; Papers with Code&lt;/a&gt; where they can add their code. Once an official implementation is added, the official code section will show up on the arXiv abstract page. From the Papers with Code site, researchers can also explore similar methods to determine which might suit their purposes best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_712&quot; style=&quot;width: 1024px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-1.35.57-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot of arXiv user page, with links to Papers with Code next to each paper&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-712&quot; height=&quot;290&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-1.35.57-PM-1024x290.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;arXiv user page, with links to Papers with Code next to each paper&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv values openness, community, and the privacy of user data and will only work with partners that abide by the same principles. All data on Papers with Code is freely available and is licensed under&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/&quot;&gt; CC-BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;. Like all third party collaborators, Papers with Code will only have access to minimal and anonymized data about arXiv users, and only for the purpose of ensuring the correct functioning of the arXivLabs features. Any other use not included in a written consent from arXiv is strictly prohibited. Upon user request this data, and another other data connected to the user can be permanently deleted. PwC also developed&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/05/new-classifier-adds-transparency-to-arxiv-submission-process/&quot;&gt; arXiv’s new classifier tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv thrives on collaboration and encourages everyone to submit ideas for enhancing arXiv at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:nextgen@arxiv.org&quot;&gt;nextgen@arxiv.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For its many flaws, it’s hard to deny that technology has improved our ability to communicate with one another. We now have a huge range of options when it comes to speaking to our friends and family, whether we’re texting, IMing, or sending them emails.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With such a smorgasbord of choices available to us, it can be easy to forget the humble phone call. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxge0000962&quot;&gt;according to new work&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: General&lt;/em&gt;, a reticence to pick up the phone might also be robbing us of stronger connections with those we love.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40477&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In their first study, Amit Kumar from the University of Texas at Austin and Nicholas Epley from the University of Chicago looked at the experience of reconnecting with an old friend. Participants were first asked to think of someone they had fallen out of touch with, stating how long it had been since they interacted and rating the current closeness of their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants then imagined reconnecting with their old friend, and were asked whether they would prefer to contact them by phone or email and how they felt the interaction would go. They were then randomly assigned to actually connect with the friend either via email or by phone over the next week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though the majority of participants believed they would form a stronger bond over the phone than via email, 67% stated they would prefer to get in touch by email (a number that rose to 72% among participants who successfully completed the full experiment). This may be because of perceived awkwardness: the majority also felt that a phone call would be more awkward. Of the participants who managed to get in touch with an old friend, those assigned to the phone condition reported feeling a significantly stronger bond than those assigned to the email condition — and in the end felt no more awkward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next study looked at &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; friends. Participants were put into pairs and assigned to one of three groups — text chat, audio chat, or video chat. To get close to their new friend, participants interacted via a “sharing game”, in which both parties ask and answer intimate questions (e.g. “can you describe a time you cried in front of another person?”). Before completing the tasks, participants predicted how well they would get to know their partner, how much they would enjoy the conversation, how strong a bond it would foster, and how awkward it would be to chat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although participants did not expect different outcomes across the different forms of communication, they again felt more connected with their partner via voice-based media than when simply using text. Participants anticipated awkwardness across all three categories (which may be more to do with the very intimate and unusual task than with specific communication methods themselves), though those expectations were unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a final study, participants were again asked to imagine reconnecting with an old friend, rating how connected or awkward they expected to feel over email or phone and indicating their preferred method on a seven-point scale. The results suggested that expectations are a key driver of our choices — the more participants expected to feel connected via phone or email, the more they preferred to communicate in that form, and the more awkward they anticipated feeling the more likely they were to avoid that method.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that worries about negative interactions could make people avoid potentially meaningful phone chats. But it doesn’t explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; calls are apparently so powerful. What is it about voice-based chats that make them so fulfilling? And do new forms of communication such as voice notes — voice recordings almost like voicemail — have the same effect? It would be worth exploring whether this kind of asynchronous communication has similar benefits to real-time audio and video calls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of jokes and memes about younger generations hating voice calls, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/sep/08/one-in-four-uk-smartphone-weekly-phone-calls&quot;&gt;consumer research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that many of us do indeed use our devices for everything &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; than speaking on the phone. The idea that people (sometimes incorrectly) anticipate awkwardness is not too much of a reach and is backed up by findings from this paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there are likely to be some individual differences here which haven’t been fully explored. A voice note might allow someone who’s shy and really does hate phone calls to communicate within their boundaries. For others, instant messaging might make them feel more present in their loved ones’ daily lives. And a long email back-and-forth might take the pressure off needing to reply instantly and give time to engage more deeply, potentially fostering a more philosophical bent to a conversation. Personality and context surely has a role to play here — and might make interesting grounds for future research into the nuances of digital communication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-64844-001&quot;&gt;It’s Surprisingly Nice to Hear You: Misunderstanding the Impact of Communication Media Can Lead to Suboptimal Choices of How to Connect With Others&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We often like to think of ourselves as impartial decision-makers — but of course, nothing could be further from the truth. Our day-to-day thoughts and behaviours are biased in &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/20/5-reasons-its-so-hard-to-think-like-a-scientist/&quot;&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/20/our-brains-rapidly-and-automatically-process-opinions-we-agree-with-as-if-they-are-facts/&quot;&gt;kinds&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/03/01/psychologists-uncover-a-new-self-serving-bias-if-its-my-theory-it-must-be-true/&quot;&gt;ways&lt;/a&gt;. But is the same true for people in the legal profession, which prides itself on its supposed objectivity and fairness?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00595-8&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Humanities and Social Sciences Communications&lt;/em&gt;, judges and lawyers may be immune to at least some of the biases that affect the rest of us. In particular, their judgements seem less prone to the biasing effects of emotive language.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40464&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sandra Baez from Universidad de los Andes in Colombia and colleagues recruited 45 judges, 60 attorneys, and 64 control participants with no experience in law. All participants read a series of 24 scenarios in which someone inflicts harm on a victim, causing damage to property, injury, or death. In half of the scenarios the harm was accidental (e.g. the protagonist kills someone with his car after his brakes fail) and in half it was intentional (e.g. the protagonist speeds up to kill someone after seeing them on the road).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Half of the participants were given descriptions in plain language, in which the basic facts were laid out. In the car scenario, for example, they were told that the victim lies on the ground and eventually dies. But the other half were given gruesome descriptions, with graphic details about what exactly happened to the victim as they died.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After reading each scenario, the participants rated the morality of the protagonist’s actions, the severity of harm caused to the victim, and the amount of punishment they felt that the protagonist deserved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, participants rated intentional harms as morally worse than accidental ones. But the language used was also important. Control participants who read scenarios framed in gruesome language rated them as more morally wrong that those who read plain language. For judges and attorneys, however, the kind of language used didn’t make a difference. This suggests that emotional language can bias people towards making more severe judgments, at least when it comes to judging morality. But legal professionals seem to be immune to this bias.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a subset of participants, the authors also found that changes in heart rate variability — a physiological measure of emotional arousal — were related to people’s moral judgement ratings when reading gruesome descriptions. But, again, this was only true for control participants. So it seems that gruesome language might provoke emotional physiological reactions which lay people use to guide their moral judgements, but which legal professionals have learned to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All three groups of participants also rated intentional harms as more severe, and assigned harsher punishments for them, than those caused by accident. But judges and attorneys rated accidental harms as less severe and assigned a less harsh punishment for them than did controls. These results imply that those in the legal profession may also be better able to focus on a perpetrator’s intentions when harms are caused accidentally, and so take this into account when making decisions about punishment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not all good news: lawyers and judges still rated harms as more severe when caused on purpose than by accident, even though the “objective” amount of harm — e.g. damage to property — was exactly the same in both conditions. The authors say that this is an example of the “harm magnification effect”, in which people overestimate harms that are caused intentionally. This could lead to inflated legal sentences in some cases, they add.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And of course, we already know judges are prone to other biases: they may &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2017/sep/15/racial-bias-criminal-justice-system-lammy-review-magistrates-courts-jury&quot;&gt;impose stricter punishments on BAME defendants&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, and can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/08/16/judges-are-more-lenient-toward-a-psychopath-when-given-a-neuro-explanation-for-his-condition/&quot;&gt;swayed by neuroscientific explanations of a defendant’s behaviour&lt;/a&gt;. Still, it seems that legal professionals’ training and expertise mitigates at least some human biases in decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00595-8&quot;&gt;The impact of legal expertise on moral decision-making biases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an English-speaker, I might “see red” with anger, go “green” with envy or, on a bad day, “feel blue”. To me, it seems natural to associate certain colours with particular emotions — but is the same true for people around the world? And if so, do we all make the same emotion/colour matchings? These questions have been investigated in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/5G3HXWNGZTT6ZXFIHTDP/full&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, which has produced some fascinating results.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40455&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An international team of 36 researchers, led by Domicele Jonauskaite at the University of Lausanne, analysed data gathered through the ongoing online &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.unil.ch/onlinepsylab/colour/main.php&quot;&gt;International Colour-Emotion Association survey&lt;/a&gt;. A total of 4,598 adults from 30 different nations on six continents used an emotion “wheel” to report their perceptions of associations between 12 different colour terms and the 20 discrete emotions marked in “spokes” on that wheel. They could match each colour term to as many emotions as they liked, or to none, and also indicate the intensity of each emotion that they associated with a colour.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that all of the nationalities in the study did indeed match colours to emotions. “The cross-modal association of colour with emotion is a universal phenomenon,” they conclude. What’s more, there were clear global similarities across the matches. Participants tended to link black with sadness, fear and/or hate; red with love and/or anger; pink with love, joy and/or pleasure; grey with sadness and/or disappointment; yellow with joy; orange with amusement; and white with relief. Across all countries, black and red were the colours most likely to be associated with emotions of any kind, while brown was the least likely. When a colour was matched to a particular emotion, the emotional intensity ratings from the various nationalities were similar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, some intriguing differences between nations also emerged. For example, Nigerians associated red with fear as well as love and anger; Chinese people associated white with sadness as well as relief; unlike other nationalities, Egyptians did not associate joy and other positive emotions with yellow; and Greeks associated purple with sadness, whereas other nationalities tended to associate purple with positive emotions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what explains the commonalities in responses, and also the differences?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some apparently universal emotion-colour links might stem from common physiological responses to different prompts. For example, a threat that we are determined to counter is associated with both a rush of blood to the face and with feelings of anger. This could, then, explain the global tendency to match red and anger.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the reasons for discrepancies are pretty clear, too. While English people, for example, traditionally wear black to funerals, white is usually worn in China, and, the researchers note, Greek people occasionally wear darker shades of purple while in mourning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also found that the closer one nation was to another, either geographically or in terms of linguistic similarity, the more similar their colour-emotion matches were likely to be. Cultural and/or linguistic differences in how colour terms are understood or used across nations could then account for the variations in matches seen between countries, the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, differences in physical environments could have an influence too. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494419303469?via=ihub&quot;&gt;the team’s own recent work&lt;/a&gt; on people from 55 nations revealed that exposure to sunshine affects the degree to which yellow is matched with joy — specifically, yellow was perceived as being more joyful in colder and rainier countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A few other interesting findings came out of the team’s new analyses. Of the nationalities included in the study, people from Finland, Lithuania and New Zealand made the most colour-emotion term matches, while people from Azerbaijan and Egypt made the fewest. (Why? The team don’t know). Also, men and women made the same associations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are a few limitations with the study, however. One obvious one is that the participants were all computer-literate. Perhaps they had been exposed via the internet to colour-emotion matches common in other countries and languages, and this could have helped to drive global similarities between the responses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, as the team concludes: “Given our current knowledge, we suggest that colour-emotion associations represent a human psychological universal that likely contributes to shared communication and comprehension. Thus, the next time you feel blue or see red, know that the world is with you.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/5G3HXWNGZTT6ZXFIHTDP/full&quot;&gt;Universal Patterns in Color-Emotion Associations Are Further Shaped by Linguistic and Geographic Proximity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 Particularly disturbing is the fact that a 4-year contract was signed right away. Why not start with a 1-2 year contract in order to gain experience and to be able to correct any undesirable developments, like those which now come apparent? Now, swissuniversities has given up all its trump cards for four years and may soon have to advertise hybrid OA Elsevier if the publication volume does not develop as anticipated. It would actually be desirable if fewer Swiss authors were to publish in hybrid journals from Elsevier, but in genuine Open Access journals. The signal that this agreement sends out to genuine Gold Open Access publishers is also fatal. Without a public call for tenders, Elsevier has been awarded a mega-contract, while those publishers who have actually been striving for OA for years and can deliver it more cheaply will be left out in the cold.

With a PAR fee of over 4500 EUR, the price level is already extremely high, which once again shows that OA in Switzerland does not fail because of the lack of money.

The money has now been used to buy 30% OA from Elsevier. But for the 100% that swissuniversities wants to achieve by 2024, a lot still has to happen.</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making/&quot;&gt;In part one of our series&lt;/a&gt; on institutional biases in review, promotion, and tenure decision making we showed how objective comparisons are not equitable. In our second part of this series we’ll show &lt;strong&gt;how individual data points can accidentally distract from the whole.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some pieces of data, such as the reputation of an applicant’s mentor or institution, or publishing in highly respected journals, are “shinier” than others. This can give initial or exceptional data points and personal reference points more perceived importance than they warrant, and privilege them over other available information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The notion of anchoring, described in our first &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, can keep us from more even-handed or equitable judgments about data points due to the fact that we are typically heavily swayed by initial pieces of data. In a personal context, for example, when the first item on a menu is $15, other offerings that cost $12-13 seem like a pretty good deal. If, by contrast, the first item is $7, that $13 item is likely to feel comparatively overpriced. An academic version of this can occur when the first person to interview for a position sets the bar — for better or worse — for others who interview after them. Just as we can’t ever truly “unhear” something once we’ve heard it, initial anchors for value persist longer than we might expect, and tend to impact our perception of the information that follows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An additional factor that can compromise our ability to accurately gauge data points is the Halo effect, in which positive impressions of individual attributes influence our overall opinions of people or products; for example, a candidate from a prestigious institution may be assumed to have more potential than one from a lesser known university. But giving preferential treatment to people based on attributes they inherited, or which signify a small component of their overall value, may also reinforce inequitable norms by using current hierarchies as a stand-in for more thoughtful deliberation. This keeps us from considering otherwise worthy candidates or considering individuals against equal criteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can institutions do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create intentional diversity:&lt;/strong&gt; The halo effect and anchoring can be amplified when the definition of what is valuable in academic assessment is implicit and goes unquestioned. Assembling diverse teams — across gender, seniority, cultures, and under-represented minoritized populations — brings a range of perspectives and experiences into decisions, which forces us to interrogate our own assumptions about value and quality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question institutional norms:&lt;/strong&gt; Becoming more institutionally open-minded can be challenging when everyone is steeped in the same environment and set of processes. Looking outside your individual institution or discipline can provide a reality check on processes, and also broaden a sense of what’s “normal,” or even possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First things last: &lt;/strong&gt;Academics are traditionally used to seeing classic “halo” data — schools, affiliations, and publications — early and prominently in review, promotion, and tenure materials or dossiers. Placing reputation-based indicators at the end of applicant materials can reduce preconceived notions or premature perceptions of quality.&lt;br /&gt;To encourage the adoption of more equitable hiring, and RPT processes, the authors are collaborating on a series of tools for DORA to assist institutions in experimenting with new processes, indicators, and principles. &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/resources/&quot;&gt;Available here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No matter how happy you are in yourself, there’s probably &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; about your personality you’d like to change. Maybe you feel you’re too uptight or want to be more outgoing, or perhaps you’d like to be less moody or more tolerant of other people’s shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s likely that such a change in personality will have some kind of social consequence, whether that’s in your relationship with your spouse or your ability to get on with your colleagues. But it might also affect which moral values you hold important.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s what Ivar R. Hannikainen and colleagues suggest in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656620300994?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Research in Personality&lt;/em&gt;. They found that growth in one area, empathy, was associated with a shift in moral foundations to a more classically “liberal” style of morality.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40450&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The study took place over fifteen weeks, with 414 participants answering weekly “waves” of questions. First, they filled in measures exploring two facets of empathy: empathic concern and perspective-taking. Empathic concern reflects someone’s reaction to suffering (e.g. “I often have tender feelings for people less fortunate than me”), while perspective-taking looks at their tendency to take other points of view (e.g. “I try to understand my friends better by imagining how things look from their perspective”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants also filled in a questionnaire looking at five “moral foundations”, or fairly broad moral values which people may prioritise in different ways. These consisted of care, fairness, loyalty to one’s ingroup, respect for authority, and observance of “purity” (for instance, keeping sexual impulses in check).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both of these sets of questions were repeated throughout the fifteen weeks of the study. During the first wave only, participants were also asked about their desire to &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; empathic concern and perspective-taking — “I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to have tender feelings towards people less fortunate than me”, for example. Demographic data, including political orientation, was also measured.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As in previous work, moral foundations were linked to political orientation: liberals were more concerned with the values of fairness and care than conservatives, who identified more closely with statements related to purity, authority and loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what of empathy &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt;? The results suggested that people can increase their levels of both empathic concern and perspective-taking: participants who had more of a desire to grow in both areas indeed saw increasing scores over the fifteen weeks. These goals also had an impact on moral foundations: those who expressed a desire to become more empathic also increased in the areas more closely linked to liberalism (fairness and care) and decreased on those areas related to conservatism (purity, authority and loyalty). Those who reported an &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; increase in either facet of empathy also increased in fairness and care (though they didn’t decline in purity, authority and loyalty).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact that participants saw an increase in their levels of empathy seems like positive news. But whether they were &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; more empathetic and able to take others’ perspectives is hard to say considering the study relied on self-reporting. Combining self-reports with observer data may improve the validity of the findings. And although the increase in empathy was associated with a more “liberal” pattern of moral values, it’s unclear whether people’s political views actually changed (indeed, conservatives would likely argue that fairness and care are not purely liberal qualities).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why might an increase in empathy see your moral foundations change? Co-author William Chopik &lt;a href=&quot;https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2020/The-unintended-consequence-of-becoming-an-empathetic-person&quot;&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; that it may be to do with opening yourself up to other arguments. “Being a better perspective-taker exposes you to all sorts of new ideas, so it makes sense that it would change someone,” he said. “When you become more empathic, it opens up a lot of doors to change humans in other ways, including how they think about morality and ideology – which may or may not have been intended.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656620300994?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;Moral migration: Desires to become more empathic predict changes in moral foundations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/05/new-classifier-adds-transparency-to-arxiv-submission-process/"/>
		<id>https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/?p=692</id>
		<updated>2020-10-05T05:00:11+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">
 &lt;p&gt;arXiv’s classification tool is now based on an algorithm developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://paperswithcode.com/about&quot;&gt;Papers with Code&lt;/a&gt;. Like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/05/20/new-user-driven-classification-tool-released/&quot;&gt;previous classifier&lt;/a&gt;, this one helps place research articles in proper categories. This process is vitally important because proper categorization helps readers find the information they seek — and assures authors that their work will be found by the right audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arXiv author experience will remain the same during the article submission process. The classifier automatically uses the title and abstract of a submitted article as input. Then, a machine learning model matches the research article to existing arXiv categories. If the model finds a match with a category different from the author selected category, a new recommendation will be proposed. Authors can either accept the new category recommendation or ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/arXiv/arxiv-classifier&quot;&gt;arXiv classifier code is publicly available on github&lt;/a&gt;, and this transparency is one key difference between the new classifier and its predecessor. arXiv values openness, and providing the machine learning methodology that underlies the classifier ensures that anyone can use and build upon it. arXiv only collaborates with partners that share arXiv’s values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developers, who are avid arXiv readers and authors, offered their expertise to help arXiv improve the user experience. They experimented with several approaches and ended up using two open source models, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146&quot;&gt;ULMFiT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01759&quot;&gt;fastText&lt;/a&gt;, trained on over 1.6 million abstracts and 120 thousand full text articles, respectively. Combined with a standard method that stratifies the data to address large category imbalance, this approach ensures that the new classifier proposes appropriate categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv continues to explore new and innovative ways to categorize articles and input from the community is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Displaying empathy towards others seems like an obvious virtue — but it can have a dark side, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200930-can-empathy-be-bad-for-you&quot;&gt;writes Richard Fisher&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Empathising with a single, identifiable individual can divert time and money away from causes that could benefit many more people, for instance. And bad actors can harness our tendency to empathise with those who are similar to us in order to get us to act aggressively towards the out-group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40435&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We often think of punishment as a tool to exact revenge on those who have wronged us. &lt;/strong&gt;But this can’t be the whole story, because we also punish those who haven’t directly caused harm, but who have not distributed resources fairly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/the-urge-to-punish-is-not-only-about-revenge-unfairness-can-unleash-it-too-145990&quot;&gt;write researchers Paul Deutchman and Katherine McAuliffe&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;. The pair suggests that punishment was used by our ancestors not only to deter bad behaviour, but also to level the playing field .&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When there is stigma surrounding a disease, it can make it harder to bring it under control — and Covid-19 is no different. &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;Science,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/leprosy-covid-19-how-stigma-makes-it-harder-fight-epidemics&quot;&gt;Vaishnavi Chandrashekhar examines&lt;/a&gt; the history of health-related stigma and its relationship with racism and prejudice, and looks at how stigma has hampered public health efforts during the current pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recent Pew survey of 20 countries around the world has found that, in general, people are pretty trusting of scientists&lt;/strong&gt;. But the survey also revealed some interesting trends: in English-speaking countries, for instance, conservatives were far less trusting of scientists than liberals. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/09/global-respect-for-scientists-is-high-but-many-worry-about-the-tech-they-enable/?comments=1&quot;&gt;John Timmer has the details&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of person is prone to believing conspiracy theories? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/health/psychology-conspiracy-theories.html&quot;&gt;Benedict Carey takes a look&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And while we’re on the subject, Neuroskeptic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/the-myths-of-the-pineal-gland&quot;&gt;covers a particularly strange conspiracy theory&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;It involves the pineal gland, a region of the brain which has somehow become the subject of all kinds of bizarre beliefs over recent decades.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, as it gets colder and the days draw in, we could perhaps learn something from a study of Norwegians living in the Arctic Circle&lt;/strong&gt;. Residents of Tromsø who viewed winter as a season to enjoy had better wellbeing than those who saw it as a boring or limiting time of the year. This suggests that developing a positive “winter mindset” could help you get through the coming dark months, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/sep/26/dreading-a-dark-winter-lockdown-think-like-a-norwegian&quot;&gt;writes David Robson&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Edith Piaf famously regretted nothing. But regret is an important emotion, because it can lead us to avoid repeating mistakes, or to heal damaged relationships. It’s also an emotion that many of us feel on a regular basis. “Regret is ubiquitous and powerful,” write Teresa McCormack at Queen’s University Belfast and colleagues in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0963721420917688&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Current Directions in Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;. “It is one of the most frequently mentioned emotions in conversation and affects a huge variety of everyday choices.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though there’s been plenty of work on regret in adults, much less is known about how it develops in children. In this new review, McCormack and her colleagues consider what we do know about its development, and outline the major gaps still left to fill. There are implications not just for the basic understanding of regret but also for informing educators in nurseries and schools. After all, even young children are expected to feel bad about harming others — but, depending on their age, there are limits to just what they can feel in such a scenario.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40428&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that by the time they are six years old, most children are able to feel at least some sense of regret. In their own work, the team has found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096516000436&quot;&gt;children are more “sad” when they take a risk and it doesn’t pay off&lt;/a&gt;. (In this case, 6- and 7-year-olds had to choose between a “safe” box, which gave them an equal chance of winning either 7 or 10 tokens to put towards a prize, or a “risky” box, which gave them an equal chance of winning 16 tokens or only one.) The team also found that children who experienced most regret were most likely to go for a safer option the following day — so regret did affect their decision-making. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022096518302923&quot;&gt;Follow-up work on the same age group&lt;/a&gt; revealed that a sense of regret can also encourage children to wait longer for a bigger reward. This is significant because, as the authors write: “‘Hot’ emotional responses are sometimes portrayed as being something that ‘cold’ cognition needs to overcome for delaying gratification”. But the results show that regret, which is of course an emotion, can itself drive a child’s decision to delay gratification.  This suggests, then, that it’s sensible to let children make their own mistakes (at least, when the outcome is not significantly harmful). Warning words from a sensible adult may not be as effective at directing wise decision-making as “hot” regret.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For adults, regret can stem not just from a sense of having made the “wrong” decision but a feeling of having missed an opportunity. It seems that this type of regret &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699931.2014.912201&quot;&gt;doesn’t emerge until about the age of 8&lt;/a&gt; — and even then it matures slowly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-08077-010&quot;&gt;Even adolescents aren’t as responsive&lt;/a&gt; to this type as regret as adults. It’s possible that they can’t anticipate regret as well as adults can, either. Research on younger children finds that though most 6-year-olds can feel regret, they can’t reliably predict that they will feel regret in one particular future scenario, compared with another.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Exactly when this ability emerges is still unclear — but, as the researchers point out, if an adolescent has a still only partially developed ability to anticipate regret, they may make risky decisions, such as not using contraception.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adults can of course feel regret not just in relation to ourselves, but also in relation to our behaviour towards other people. We might regret not being more gracious about an unwanted birthday gift, for example, or regret not calling a friend who we later discover was going through a difficult time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year, McCormack and her colleagues explored this kind of “interpersonal” regret in groups of 5- to 6-year-olds and 7- to 9-year-olds. &lt;a href=&quot;https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cdev.13029&quot;&gt;In this study,&lt;/a&gt; children collected stickers to win a prize, and could also give their stickers to other children. When the younger children discovered that they had kept a sticker that they didn’t ultimately need but which, if they had given it to another child, would have allowed that child to win a prize, they didn’t seem to experience any regret. However, the 7- to 9-year-olds did. The team also found that the children who experienced this type of regret were more likely to act pro-socially on a subsequent task. As the team writes, “This latter finding suggested that interpersonal regret can result in children acting more kindly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A lot more work is still needed to investigate how this type of regret drives moral development. And there are other major unanswered questions. Little has been done to explore how regret affects children’s and adolescents’ decisions out of the lab, in the real world, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, the team concludes that the work to date paints a picture of regret as a “sophisticated emotion that develops relatively late in childhood” — as well as one that we clearly need to understand better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0963721420917688&quot;&gt;Regret and Decision-Making: A Developmental Perspective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You could solve extreme depression or anxiety or schizophrenia or seizures. You could give a mother back her memory so she could remember who her kids are, you know. Basically, if you live long enough, you’re going to get dementia of some kind. And you’ll want to have something to help you.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I write this post, I’m struggling a little to put words onto the page. I didn’t sleep well last night, and my tiredness has taken its toll on my ability to concentrate. But at least I’m sat at my desk at home and not, say, in control of a massive hunk of metal filled with fuel and electronics, hurtling through space at thousands of kilometres an hour. Because a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-71929-4&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports &lt;/em&gt;has found that astronauts need to get enough sleep too — and when they don’t, their performance suffers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40421&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Erin Flynn-Evans from NASA Ames Research Center and colleagues studied people taking part in a spaceflight simulation on Earth. They weren’t actually astronauts, but “astronaut-like” participants, who all met NASA’s physical standards for space flight, as well as other criteria (such as having Master’s degree in a STEM subject). The participants lived in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/analogs/hera/&quot;&gt;Human Analog Research Exploration (HERA) habitat&lt;/a&gt;, a self-contained unit designed to mimic living and working conditions during space exploration. This paper included data from five separate “missions”, each of which involved four participants living together in the HERA habitat for 45 days (though one of the missions had to be cut short due to a hurricane).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Throughout each mission, the participants had a variety of tasks to complete, such as “extravehicular activities” and scientific work. Once every three days, at five points throughout the day, they also completed the psychomotor vigilance task, which simply involves watching a screen and pressing a button whenever a light randomly appears.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Importantly, each weekday participants were only allowed five hours of sleep; at the weekend they were allowed eight hours. They weren’t permitted to nap, and could only drink caffeine before 2pm. The researchers could therefore look at how performance on the psychomotor vigilance task changed across the course of the mission, as well as specifically on days when the “astronauts” got more or less sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that participants’ performance worsened as the mission went on, with reaction times on the task becoming slower. Interestingly, participants’ self-reported fatigue &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; decline across the course of the mission, suggesting that tests like this may provide a better measure of performance than simply asking astronauts how they’re feeling. Participants were also slower and missed more of the lights in the task on days when they got only five hours of sleep, compared to days when they got eight hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the authors conclude, the findings “suggest that simply meeting the criteria required to be an astronaut is not in itself a determinant of resilience to chronic sleep restriction”. This isn’t entirely surprising — after all, astronauts are only human, and people in other professions with rigorous training requirements, such as pilots, are also adversely affected by lack of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are some obvious limitations to the study: although it simulated a space mission, it was still conducted on Earth; similarly, the psychomotor vigilance task isn’t necessarily a good representation of the complex jobs astronauts need to perform. It’s also worth noting that the changes in reaction times on the task were pretty small, in the region of tens of milliseconds difference between the beginning and end of the missions, and there was lots of variation between participants. It would be interesting to explore these in more detail: are there particular characteristics that make astronauts’ performance more or less likely to suffer after a lack of sleep?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the research does suggest that many days or weeks of poor sleep may build up to impair astronauts’ day-to-day functioning: an important insight given that this is the sort of time frame for future missions to the moon or beyond. And while NASA does allow crewmembers to sleep for eight hours per night on missions, astronauts themselves report actually sleeping for just six hours. So, the researchers say, it will be important to consider ways to promote better sleep while in space.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authors: Ruth Schmidt is an Associate Professor at IIT’s Institute of Design and Anna Hatch is the program director for&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; DORA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. PLOS supports DORA financially via organizational membership, and PLOS is represented on the steering committee of DORA.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;This blog is part one in a 4-part series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The field of behavioral economics emerged in the 1970s from the confluence of psychology with human judgment and decision-making, grounded in the realization that humans don’t always act “rationally” or in their best interests. Real-word applications of behavioral economics are often focused on consumers and citizens, such as increasing the percentage of adults who receive influenza vaccinations or helping people save for retirement. However, the same decision-making biases that we wrestle with in our personal lives also show up in professional settings. In fact, our misguided assumptions of rationality and expertise in academia may actually make us &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; prone to cognitive biases than we think. So when making decisions on behalf of others in hiring, review, promotion, and tenure, it is even more important to protect against shortcuts and habits in our thinking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although recognizing personal biases is important, bias training that teaches individuals how to become more aware of decision-making tendencies has been shown to have a limited impact on actual behaviors. Instead, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674089037&quot;&gt;creating new structural and institutional conditions&lt;/a&gt; — in the parlance of behavioral economists, creating new “choice architectures” to scaffold decision-making processes — is often more effective when attempting to reduce bias in the interest of promoting and supporting more equitable practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While not a comprehensive set, we’ve identified &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DORA_UnintendendedCognitiveSystemBiases.pdf&quot;&gt;four major barriers to equitable decision-making in hiring, review, promotion, and tenure processes that commonly result from biased thinking&lt;/a&gt;. In the next 4 weeks we will provide examples of what these barriers are, the specific cognitive biases that feed them, and recommendations for overcoming these barriers at an institutional level. Part one delves into Objective comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. “Objective” comparisons are not necessarily equitable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualitative judgments are often notoriously difficult to make, in part because their “apples and oranges” nature makes it challenging to say a single option is truly better.This can lead to well-meaning efforts to reduce complexity, such as using proxies to simplify comparisons. While qualities that can be more easily measured or ranked are appealing because they feel less subjective, the temptation to rely on quantifiable indicators to signal quality has some &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/2020/05/19/rethinking-research-assessment-ideas-for-action/&quot;&gt;significant implications on &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/2020/05/19/rethinking-research-assessment-ideas-for-action/&quot;&gt;decision-making&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to oversimplifying options in an effort to make them more comparable, the urge to measure things can imbue measurability itself with outsized importance. But as &lt;strong&gt;Campbell’s Law&lt;/strong&gt; has long made clear, once indicators are accepted as a way to gauge value, they start to lose meaning as objective measures. Instead, they increase the temptation to focus on a narrow set of activities and reduce investment in reviewing other meaningful, but less rewarded, achievements. Publishing research in venues with high Journal Impact Factors (JIFs) is a classic example: Due to the perceived importance of citations and “high-quality” publications in promotion and tenure dossiers, decisions about what research to conduct, submit, and publish can lead evaluators to prioritize research with a higher likelihood of getting published in the “right” journals over other forms of impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second form of objectivity bias is the &lt;strong&gt;Matthew effect&lt;/strong&gt;, which describes the tendency forresources to flow to those who already have them. This can occur when a lack of time or motivation to vet results means that decision-makers default to preconceived ideas about what seems good, such as when researchers with long track records of grants receive a disproportionate amount of new funding. Another example of the Matthew effect is when highly cited references become more cited in part becauseresearchers see that they’re highly cited, rather than because they are more relevant or higher quality. This tendency is more likely to increase as our reliance on automation as a means to customize or deliver content grows, such as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1464884920915374&quot;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; where popular items are more heavily promoted in newsfeeds or where items recommended by Amazon attract more hits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the notion of &lt;strong&gt;anchoring&lt;/strong&gt; — a cornerstone of early behavioral economics research, in which the first piece of data we see or hear defines the reference point against which subsequent data is compared — can create a false sense of objectivity and inadvertently emphasize relative comparisons between options rather than their actual values. For example, receiving a $2 million dollar grant one year may anchor one’s expectations for the value of future grants, causing a $1.2 million grant to feel comparatively disappointing. But anchoring can also manifest in a more general, qualitative context, such as when using one’s own personal life as an “anchor’ to judge others’ experiences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can institutions do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contextualize data.&lt;/strong&gt; Relying wholly on quantifiable measures can contribute to a false sense of objectivity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/peps.12052&quot;&gt;Structured interview and review protocols&lt;/a&gt; can reduce inequities in review, promotion, and tenure (RPT) decision-making. Balancing the use of quantitative metrics with qualitative inputs, like narrative CV formats that capture more intangible qualities, can help create a counterweight by contextualizing data points.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversify standards.&lt;/strong&gt; The temptation to anchor on old assumptions of what good researcher performance looks like often arises out of habit. To counter the urge to use a narrow or an anecdotal set of data that emphasize legacy notions of importance, institutions and decision-makers can elicit and select standards gathered from a wider set of sources and based on a more holistic set of values.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balance quantitative and qualitative measures.&lt;/strong&gt; The human tendency to bend our behaviors to meet quantifiable targets is stronger than we think. Institutions should actively identify and recognize where setting specific, quantifiable goals may reinforce some behaviors at the expense of others. Institutions should make sure that what is being measured adheres to organizational or disciplinary goals and values, like achieving real-world impact, rather than what is easiest to measure, such as university rankings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next Monday we’ll tackle how individual data points can accidentally distract from the whole.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How can you discourage kids from copying each other on tests? You could always use a simple frame to separate them, or even a ruler to draw an imaginary line between their desks. When these behavioural “nudge” techniques were used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/117/32/19101.short?rss=1&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Current Directions in Psychological Scienc&lt;/em&gt;e, they significantly reduced cheating among 5 to 6-year-olds. This shows “that even seemingly unremarkable features of children’s environments can nudge them to act honestly,” write the researchers, led by Li Zhao at Hangzhou Normal University in China.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40415&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The team set out to explore the extent to which a physical, spatial barrier might also act as a barrier against moral transgressions. In each of a series of four studies, a child was seated a small table and given a set of counting problems, which were impossible to complete in the allotted time. A short distance away was another identical table, on which the experimenter put the answer sheet before leaving the room. Though all the children were instructed not to cheat, from a purely practical perspective, it was easy to do so. In fact, in the control conditions, when there was no barrier (real or imaginary) between the child’s table and the answers, hidden cameras showed that about half did indeed look at the answers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the team found that a barrier of some sort did make a difference. In the first study, a metal frame either fitted with transparent plastic cheating or simply left empty was placed between the tables. In both scenarios, the child could easily see the answers if they wanted to — but the frame with the sheeting cut the cheating rate to about 15%, while the empty frame reduced cheating to just under 30%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the second and third studies, the team moved the barrier into a variety of positions around the tables. They found that to reduce cheating, the barrier had to be in the child’s eye line when they looked towards the other table.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the fourth study, there was no physical barrier at all. Instead, before leaving the room, the experimenter used a toy magic wand to outline what she said was an “invisible frame” between the tables. This imaginary barrier was about as effective as the empty frame was in the first study at reducing cheating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why did a simple frame, and even an imaginary frame, reduce cheating? One possibility, the researchers say, is that from a very young age, children learn to use environmental cues to guide their movements. So, for example, they might learn that while it’s okay to play football in an open park, it’s not okay to pass through a gate in a neighbour’s fence, to play football in their garden. It’s possible that children generalised this type of learning, viewing the barriers as dividers between a permissible space and a prohibited space.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In English, of course, we even talk about “crossing the line” between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. (I seem to tell my children that they’ve crossed the line on an almost daily basis.) These were Chinese children. I don’t know if Mandarin has the equivalent metaphor, but if it does, this might have influenced their children’s behaviour — or, if the study were to be replicated in an English-speaking country, perhaps cheating might be reduced still further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the team notes, though the frame was always in place when the child sat down, and the experimenter didn’t even refer to it (except for when it was imaginary), the children may well have made the implicit assumption that someone had put it there for a reason — presumably to stop them from cheating. So kids’ ability to tap into this sort of social cue could be part of the reason why they were less inclined to cheat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study was on young children. Would a physical barrier have the same impact on cheating in older kids? In this study, older children had a higher rate of cheating than younger children (no matter what the experimental condition) — but the frames were just as effective at &lt;em&gt;reducing&lt;/em&gt; cheating, no matter what the child’s age. So it’s possible that older children would be susceptible to the frame effect, too.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More work is clearly needed to examine the specific mechanisms that underlie the new findings, and to explore just how barriers might be used in real classrooms and exam halls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/117/32/19101.short?rss=1&quot;&gt;The moral barrier effect: Real and imagined barriers can reduce cheating&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The putamen is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/subcortical&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;subcortical&lt;/a&gt; structure that is part of a group of structures known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/basal-ganglia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;basal ganglia&lt;/a&gt;. It is also a component of the dorsal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/striatum&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;striatum&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the putamen and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/caudate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;caudate nucleus&lt;/a&gt;. The putamen is adjacent to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/globus-pallidus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;globus pallidus&lt;/a&gt;, and the putamen and globus pallidus together are sometimes referred to as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/lentiform-nucleus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lentiform or lenticular nucleus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-rte-preserve-empty=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the putamen and what does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a component of the basal ganglia, the putamen is best known for its role in facilitating movement. To understand the putamen’s role in movement, it’s helpful to think about how the basal ganglia as a whole may contribute to movement. While this has not been determined definitively, one popular hypothesis suggests that the basal ganglia are important for facilitating desired movements while at the same time inhibiting unwanted and/or competing movements. To read more about the basal ganglia and this purported function, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/blog/what-are-basal-ganglia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watch this 2-Minute Neuroscience video to learn more about the basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The putamen (and striatum as a whole) is thought to act as a critical input area for the basal ganglia. In other words, to accomplish their movement-related functions, the basal ganglia need to receive information from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebral-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cerebral cortex&lt;/a&gt; about movements that you want to make. Much of this information travels first to the putamen or the caudate via a pathway called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/corticostriatal-pathway&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;corticostriatal pathway&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Most of the neurons in the putamen contain the neurotransmitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gaba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GABA&lt;/a&gt; and extend out of the putamen to other regions of the basal ganglia— specifically the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/globus-pallidus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;globus pallidus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/substantia-nigra&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;substantia nigra&lt;/a&gt;. These neurons that leave the putamen create pathways that are thought to be involved in either the facilitation or inhibition of movements (depending on the pathway). &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9004351/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Research suggests that neurons in the putamen are activated before and during movement&lt;/a&gt;—especially movement of the limbs and torso. It is thought that the firing of these putamen neurons contributes not only to the initiation of a movement, but also to the decision to make a movement and the selection of a movement to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For years, the putamen was considered to be primarily devoted to movement. But more recent research has begun to point to an expanded role for the putamen. For example, it is now thought that that the putamen is also involved with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12052921/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;learning and memory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28585051/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2569212/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emotion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dysfunction in the putamen could be a factor in a number of disorders, but is strongly linked to problems with motor function. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/huntingtons-disease&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Huntington’s disease&lt;/a&gt; (HD), for example—which is characterized by rapid and spasmodic involuntary movements—is associated with&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27529157&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; the degeneration and death of neurons in the caudate and putamen&lt;/a&gt;. These neurons may be involved with the inhibition of unwanted movements, and their degeneration in HD may cause involuntary movement to be more difficult to suppress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neurodegeneration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Neurodegeneration&lt;/a&gt; in the basal ganglia is also the hallmark pathological sign of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/parkinsons-disease&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; (PD), a condition that causes slow, labored movement along with tremors (among other symptoms). With PD, the neurodegeneration occurs primarily in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/substantia-nigra&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;substantia nigra&lt;/a&gt;, but other areas of the basal ganglia—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6641567&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;like the putamen&lt;/a&gt;—are also affected. Additionally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30465864/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;abnormalities in dopamine function in the putamen&lt;/a&gt; are thought to contribute to the movement problems PD patients experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;References&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(in addition to linked text above)&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mink JW.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/09/arxivlabs-icon.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Image of arXiv smiley bones flask&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-682 size-medium alignright&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/09/arxivlabs-icon-272x300.png&quot; width=&quot;272&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;arXiv has launched a new, formalized framework enabling innovative collaborations with individuals and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Members of our community want to contribute tools that enhance the arXiv experience, and we value that kind of community engagement,” said Eleonora Presani, arXiv Executive Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs, a concept developed years ago, acts as a conduit for collaboration. Now, it appears as a physical space on the article record page, and, importantly, sets guidelines for collaborations between arXiv and third parties, ensuring that partners share arXiv’s values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The arXivLabs framework complements other collaborative projects such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/08/05/leveraging-machine-learning-to-fuel-new-discoveries-with-the-arxiv-dataset/&quot;&gt;arXiv’s Kaggle dataset&lt;/a&gt;,” said Presani, “and demonstrates how great results are achieved when the community works together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv readers will now find a new feature, below existing content on the article record page, that reflects the new framework. The arXivLabs tabs highlight different experimental tools developed by collaborators, and will be updated as new tools become available. These add value and functionality for both readers and authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the Bibliographic Explorer displays information about works that cite and are cited by arXiv papers and their published versions. This enables discovery of relevant research by providing user-friendly navigation of an article’s citation tree. The Explorer, developed by Matt Bierbaum, was already available on the site, and will now be featured in the “Bibliographic Tools” tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tool, the CORE Recommender, facilitates the exploration of relevant open access papers from a global network of research repositories and is now accessible on the “Recommenders” tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv’s third party collaborators&lt;/a&gt; will only have access to minimal and anonymized data about arXiv users, and only for the purpose of ensuring the correct functioning of the arXivLabs features. Any other use not included in a written consent from arXiv is strictly prohibited. Upon user request, this data, and another other data connected to the user can be permanently deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This post was written by Alexia A., Hannah Dee, Karel Green, Alison Young and Yolanda Ohene from Scientists are Humans and Rebecca Kirk from PLOS &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kindness matters, in life generally, but also in the research environment. This simple concept was behind the launch two years ago of the website &lt;a href=&quot;https://scientistsarehumans.com/&quot;&gt;Scientists Are Humans&lt;/a&gt;, with the aim to support scientists to move the research culture to be more kind; with the aim to change the game. We want to amplify even more voices on the site, including yours, so please get in &lt;a href=&quot;https://scientistsarehumans.com/want-to-support-scientists-are-humans/&quot;&gt;touch &lt;/a&gt;to share your story (we are flexible about format and posts can be anonymous).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The website was one outcome of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stemgamechangers.github.io/&quot;&gt;Gamechangers for diversity in STEM&lt;/a&gt; (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) event in London run at the Turing Institute. This two-day workshop initiated and fostered projects to support more diversity in STEM. The concept of Scientists Are Humans is that the challenges faced by minorities in STEM could be ameliorated with more understanding and more kindness. One of the ways we can build understanding is by telling our stories, and listening kindly when others tell their stories. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So why is kindness so important? A look at the content of the website quickly makes it clear how it can make a huge difference. In the past two years the website published articles reporting from picket lines, about the BLM movement, on leaving academia, on struggling and completing PhDs, on being an ally, on mental health and on being brave – amongst many others. The variety of voices, and the clarity with which they speak has been inspiring, thought provoking and has humanized the science and scientists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The importance of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://scientistsarehumans.com/manifesto/&quot;&gt;manifesto &lt;/a&gt;for being more kind could not be more important as we all find our own ways to manage the particular challenges that we are facing at the moment. We all need to be more kind, and we will all benefit from a profession with kindness at its core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/scientists-are-flawed-stressed-inspired-kind-we-are-human/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Scientists are flawed, stressed, inspired, kind… we are human&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Official PLOS Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In popular culture, there’s an idea that lots of successful people are… well, not that nice. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elrnAl6ygeM&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glengarry Glen Ross&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The Apprentice, &lt;/em&gt;there’s a litany of bad bosses and aggressive success stories in film and television. The message seems to be that to get ahead you need to ditch the niceties and think about number one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This stereotype might not reflect what’s really going on, however. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/117/37/22780&quot;&gt;new longitudinal study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;PNAS, &lt;/em&gt;a team from the University of California, Berkeley and Colby College tracked individuals over a fourteen year period, looking to see what became of those who were more disagreeable (not a cohort many of us would particularly long to be in).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They found that selfish, combative, and manipulative people have no real advantage at work — not because there are no benefits to such behaviour, but because its positive and negative impacts cancel each other out.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40407&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the first study, Cameron Anderson and colleagues measured the Big Five personality traits of 457 participants during their university years. Then fourteen years later, when those participants were in the workforce, the team assessed participants’ power in the organisation, their view of their influence in the workplace, and organisational culture — how aggressive, criticising, political or selfish a participant felt it was.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those who were most disagreeable at the first measurement did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have more power at the second, regardless of their age, gender or ethnicity — suggesting that selfishness and aggression do not result in higher levels of power or attainment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the second study, the team looked more closely at workplace behaviours in another group which had been followed in a similar way. Behaviours were grouped into four categories: dominant behaviour (e.g. “I am willing to bully others to achieve important goals”), political behaviour (e.g. “I build alliances with important people”), communal behaviour (e.g. “I care about others’ wellbeing”) and competent behaviour (e.g. “I make important contributions to my team’s success”). Importantly, coworkers also rated participants on these same workplace behaviours, as well power and organisational rank.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coworker ratings largely agreed not only with one another but also with participants’ own ratings of themselves, suggesting that self-insight was fairly accurate. And the results showed that those who engaged in more dominant, political, communal &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; competent behaviour had higher levels of power. Personality-wise, people who were more extraverted 14 years previously engaged more in each of these categories, doing “everything right”, as the team put it, to attain higher power. Those with disagreeable personalities, however, only engaged in more dominant behaviours — and &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; communal ones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So whilst dominant behaviour might get you ahead in some ways, it’s clear that other, more prosocial, types of behaviour are also a key part of the process. If you’re a disagreeable person, being selfish might enhance your power to some extent, but failing to be generous and kind can cancel this out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This might not be the case, however, in certain environments — if you work in an industry where prosocial behaviour is neither valued nor particularly useful, disagreeable people may be more likely to reach positions of power.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future research could take the opposite approach: do people become more selfish and disagreeable once they’re in positions of power, and do those kinds of traits help them keep it? It may be that power really does corrupt — or we might find that it’s mere tropes around aggression that perpetuate the myth that nice guys finish last.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/117/37/22780&quot;&gt;People with disagreeable personalities (selfish, combative, and manipulative) do not have an advantage in pursuing power at work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 n recent years, fake news has become a growing problem in the international information landscape. More and more projects deal with how to expose and avoid them. One of them is the project of Charles Letaillieur and Sylvain Massip. With a tool for the general public, the two want to support checking simple messages for their truthfulness with the help of open access publications and of artificial intelligence.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bruno Pichler studied medicine, obtained a PhD in neuroscience, worked in the labs of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifn.me.tum.de/new/konnerth.php&quot;&gt;Arthur Konnerth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/mrsic-flogel-lab&quot;&gt;Tom Mrsic-Flogel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/margrie-lab&quot;&gt;Troy Margrie&lt;/a&gt;, and was R&amp;amp;D manager at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientifica.uk.com/&quot;&gt;Scientifica&lt;/a&gt;, before founding his own company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inss.org.uk/&quot;&gt;INSS&lt;/a&gt;, “to provide the international neuroscience community with bespoke hard- and software solutions and other consulting services”. He is not only a highly experienced builder and designer of two-photon microscopes but also a very friendly and open human being. So I was very happy to have the opportunity to ask him a couple of questions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interview took place on September 8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt; 2020 in a virtual meeting and lasted around 1.5 hours. Afterwards, I transcribed, shortened and edited the recorded interview. For a brief orientation, here’s an ordered but non-exhaustive list of the topics discussed:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why neuroscience?&lt;br /&gt;How to get into optics and programming&lt;br /&gt;Role models&lt;br /&gt;Projects in academia&lt;br /&gt;Why didn’t you become a PI?&lt;br /&gt;At Scientifica&lt;br /&gt;Founding one’s own company&lt;br /&gt;Brexit&lt;br /&gt;Performance checks for a 2P scope&lt;br /&gt;Preamplifiers&lt;br /&gt;How to clean optics&lt;br /&gt;The detection path&lt;br /&gt;Teaching people how to solve problems&lt;br /&gt;Mesoscopes&lt;br /&gt;mesoSPIM&lt;br /&gt;AODs&lt;br /&gt;Fixed-wavelength lasers&lt;br /&gt;Multiplexed acquisition&lt;br /&gt;Scanimage&lt;br /&gt;Okinawa&lt;br /&gt;Advice to young scientists&lt;br /&gt;Bluegrass music&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find any questionable statements, you should consider blaming my editing first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And since the entire interview is quite long, take a cup of tea, and take your time to read it&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-white-color has-text-color&quot;&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Rupprecht: &lt;/strong&gt;You studied medicine before you started your PhD. What was your motivation to do a PhD in neuroscience, and to continue in neuroscience afterwards?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bruno Pichler:&lt;/strong&gt; This was just something that happened: I really loved the first years of medical school, basic science, physics, biology, anatomy, physiology, and all that. But halfway through medical school when the clinical work started, I realized that it wasn’t for me. So I looked for new inspiration, and I stumbled upon the website of Arthur Konnerth’s lab. I called on a whim and half an hour later I was in his office, and he offered me a job. He said, “why don’t you take a year off from medical school and start working towards a PhD here?” So I worked full-time in the lab for a year, and then went back to finish medical school. But at that point I had no interest in a career in clinical medicine, I just wanted to complete the medical degree and then work in the lab and continue my PhD. – So, not much thought behind it, it’s just how things transpired.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6600&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6600&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Brian Campbell&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;1502619712&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Brian Campbell 2017&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;inss-003-edit2&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/inss-003-edit2.jpg?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/inss-003-edit2.jpg?w=200&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/inss-003-edit2.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1437,2156&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/inss-003-edit2/&quot; height=&quot;489&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/inss-003-edit2.jpg?w=683&quot; width=&quot;326&quot; /&gt;(c) Bruno Pichler&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; The medical studies did not really prepare you well for the more technical aspects of what you have been doing afterwards. How did you learn all of this, for example optics, or programming?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;Again, it was just something that happened: there were microscopes that needed troubleshooting, there were things I didn’t understand, and every time I didn’t understand something, I tried to find more information about it. Some of the information sticks with you – and that’s how you learn and how you get into optics and software.&lt;br /&gt;For example, there was some custom-written image analysis software in the lab and I didn’t really understand what it did to the data, so I sat down with the guy who wrote it and asked about all the calculations it made and then I cautiously started to make some changes to it – and it just naturally emerged from there. I never consciously sat down and said, “oh, I want to learn programming!” I had a problem in front of me that I needed to solve, and so I solved it. And whatever I learned while solving it is now part of my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-blue-color has-text-color&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;&quot;&gt;“People who inspired me were often those in support roles, like the lab technicians who taught me how to pipette, or the engineers in the electronic and mechanical workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; So would you describe yourself as a problem-solver?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I think that is probably an accurate description. My main driving force is that whenever I see a technical problem, I want to find an elegant solution for it. I can’t help it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Did you have a role model as a scientist, or somebody who inspired you to continue with neuroscience?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I definitely have a few people who inspired me, but I wouldn’t say I had a ‘role model’. There’s obviously the intellectual giants like Richard Feynman or Horace Barlow. Then there are the scientists that I worked with, Arthur Konnerth, Tom Mrsic-Flogel, Troy Margrie, and of course all the colleagues in those labs. But, on a very practical level, people who inspired me were often those in support roles, like the lab technicians who taught me how to pipette, or the engineers in the electronic and mechanical workshops. For example, Werner Zeitz, the electronics guy in Arthur Konnerth’s lab, who is known for his famous Zeitz puller (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zeitz-puller.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.zeitz-puller.com/&lt;/a&gt;). We were building a two-photon resonant scanner with Werner back in 2004/2005, and he built a 19” rack-mountable device box – no labels on it, just unlabeled pots and BNC connectors – which transformed the scanning data into a TV image and sent it to a frame grabber card. Nowadays, we do this in software but it was all done in hardware at the time. Same with the mechanical guy, Dietmar Beyer: He was such a skilled manual machinist, and he would just make whatever we needed without any CNC machining. Another guy that really inspired me back as a PhD student was Yury Kovalchuk. He was a senior postdoc at the time. He knew everything about two-photon microscopy, and he was building an AOD scanner back in 2004/2005. It was the way he understood these systems and explained everything to me whenever I had any questions – those kind of people inspired me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; From your entire academic career, what was your most rewarding project, big or small?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s so difficult to say, because everything is kind of rewarding. What I can certainly say is that I don’t believe in putting off reward for a long time, and the idea that ‘the more you suffer, the bigger the reward’. I like it when you have smaller rewards, but more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; I can definitely relate to this… but at least scientific publications usually do not come so frequently. If you have to choose, which scientific publication where you took part in would you like to highlight, and what was your contribution?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;There was a paper in 2012 by Kamilla Angelo in Troy Margrie’s lab (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3442227/&quot;&gt;paper link&lt;/a&gt;). I came very late to the party, all the experiments had already been done, the first version of the manuscript had been completed, and Troy just asked me to read it and give some comments. I noticed something in the analysis where the manuscript didn’t actually show unambiguously one aspect of the claim in the paper. We tried to come up with some way to design new experiments to prove that unambiguously, but at some point it occurred to me that you could just do it with the existing data, just with a different type of analysis. And once the idea had come up of doing this pair-wise scrambling of all the data points and then calculating pair-wise differences, it was very quick and easy to write some code to analyze it. And it supported exactly what we thought it would support, but now unambiguously. That felt really rewarding, to be able to nail something that would have otherwise required more experiments with a bit of clever analysis, that was really cool.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Sounds like that! Especially your PI was probably really happy about this, because it saved a lot of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I guess so. The paper would have been highly publishable without my input, but it was just ever so slightly better with my input; and that’s good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-blue-color has-text-color&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;&quot;&gt;“I was always more of a Malcolm Young than an Angus Young.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Why did you not become a PI yourself?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;Well, to start with, I was never really PI material …&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; What would you define as PI material?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;Are you okay with an AC/DC reference? Would you understand what I mean when I say “I was always more of a Malcolm Young than an Angus Young”?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;No, not really …&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;Malcolm Young was the rhythm guitarist in AC/DC, he was always in the background and played this steady rhythm, whereas Angus Young is the flamboyant lead guitarist in his school uniform who runs up and down the stage and is the focal point of attention for the audience. When I say “I was always more of a Malcolm Young than an Angus Young”, I’m talking about having a rock-solid line of people in the back who make sure that the lead guitarist and the lead singer can shine: I like to be in that role at the back. As a PI, you have to represent the lab, you have to present your work outside, you have to sell the ideas to funding bodies… so you have to have a little bit more of a flamboyant and outgoing nature. I’m too shy for this, so the PI path was never really on the cards for me to begin with. I was quite happy to be a sort of a medium level scientist – except that I felt there was more I could do to help other people. It felt self-indulgent to just play around with cool technology and have brainy conversations with smart people in the lab. I wanted to provide some value for others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; And then you chose Scientifica. Why Scientifica? How did that happen?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I did not really choose Scientifica. I wasn’t actually looking for a job when I left academia. My plan was to go back to the Bavarian Alps and work as a skiing instructor –that’s what I had done before I went to medical school. I figured that it would be really nice to do that again for a season, to pass the time until some new opportunity floated past. And then it just so happened that the opportunity to work at Scientifica floated past earlier than I had anticipated. They rang me and said, “we’ve heard you’re leaving academia and we’re looking for a software person to do some custom stuff for Scientifica’s two-photon customers”, and I was like “well, that sounds like a good idea”, and then I joined Scientifica. There was no job interview, there was no searching for a job, the job found me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; How was the work like at Scientifica?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; Initially it was mostly intended to be customization of software, for example little Matlab add-ons for Scanimage or stuff like that. But then we also needed a resonant scanning system, and there wasn’t really any software available for resonant scanning before Vidriotech started …&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; … and then you wrote SciScan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;And that’s when I wrote SciScan. I had already written a software for resonant scanning in Labview some years before – for the frame-grabber that we discussed earlier, so I already knew what to do. While writing SciScan I also became involved in the hardware development of the resonant scanner, with the mechanical engineer and the electrical engineer. And so the job role gradually moved towards R&amp;amp;D management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m a bit younger, so I don’t know whether the resonant scanners always came from Cambridge Technology, or was there a different provider? Or did you build the scanners in-house at Scientifica?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;No, the resonant scanners were always the same as back in 2003 when I first started using them. The manufacturer was originally called General Scanning Inc, then it became GSI Lumonics, which later merged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridgetechnology.com/&quot;&gt;Cambridge Technology&lt;/a&gt;, which was then bought by Novanta. There was a number of name changes involved, but no changes to the product.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you tried out resonant scanners from other companies as well?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m only aware of one other resonant scanner that is suitable for what we’re doing and that’s from a company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eopc.com/scanners.html&quot;&gt;EOPC&lt;/a&gt;. I have not actually worked with their resonant scanners yet, but I will be in probably about two weeks from now. We have bought two of their resonant scanners, because they can be synchronized with each other.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Sounds like a challenging project. Probably with two pulsed lasers?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;No, it’s about temporal multiplexing with a single laser. We want the scanners to run in synchrony so that we can use a single data acquisition system for the two paths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-blue-color has-text-color&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;&quot;&gt;“When I was a scientist, I was building stuff myself because there wasn’t any company that I could go to and ask them to build it for me. And when I started INSS that was still true.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Okay, this makes sense. – After Scientifica, you founded your own company, INSS. What was the biggest challenge when you got started? And why did you found your own company?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;The ‘why’ is very easy to explain: When I started with Scientifica, I was very close to the customers, I was building custom software modules, was interacting with scientists very closely when it came to making hardware modifications to any of the existing products or new suggestions for new hardware products. As the company grew bigger, I got more into a management role. I felt I was getting a little bit too far away from the customer and more involved in managing people and conducting things internally. It is a whole different style of working when you want to make something that is not a prototype but a production item where you want to sell 100 pieces of. Then you have to think more about questions like, how can we design it in a way that you can build it routinely and efficiently, and you have to think about all the supply chain, and build assembly instructions, and how you teach people to do that. There’s a lot of work in the background that is relatively far away from the actual experiment that the neuroscientist is going to do with that microscope and I felt like I wanted to get closer to that again. Also, if you want to sell hundreds of microscopes, it’s not really economically viable to do individual customer specials. From a business development perspective it’s perfectly understandable that Scientifica wanted to have a more standard offering and make off-the-shelf turn-key systems. But that was not so much what I was interested in. I like getting involved in changing things, not making the same thing all the time. I also felt that this sort of very customized, individualized service was not something that was available. When I was a scientist, I was building stuff myself because there wasn’t any company that I could go to and ask them to build it for me. And when I started INSS that was still true. If you’re a scientist you either buy a microscope that someone has designed to fit many purposes, but it may not be perfect for your very specific purpose. And I thought, well, surely there’s a need for modifying, customizing, making something perfect for a particular experiment and stripping out everything else that may not be needed. If you custom-build it from off-the-shelf components, you can save a lot of money. And surely from the money that people save they’d be quite happy to give me some of it, if I advise them how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Didn’t it feel like shaky ground when you started? I mean, you were responsible for everything, and you didn’t get a salary anymore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I think what helped a lot is that I’ve been involved in the music scene, and I knew a lot of musicians that were self-employed. They were getting money from gigs and teaching and playing on other people’s records and they were making a living without being employed – and I felt I could do the same thing. I had been playing gigs, I knew how to ask a pub owner to pay us money for providing music in the pub. And I figured, conceptually it wouldn’t be much different whether I come to your lab and build something for you, or whether I come to your pub and play a gig for you. You just ask beforehand how much you’re going to get paid for the gig, and if it isn’t enough to cover the costs then you can’t play that gig – it’s not exactly rocket science. It was good that I’d done it for a few years in the music business, it gave me a lot more confidence that this would work out in the microscope consulting business, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;INSS is based in the UK. Have you been affected by the Brexit so far, or will you be affected by it?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I haven’t been affected by Brexit yet, everything is still the same until the end of 2020. Nobody knows what sort of forms we will need to fill in next year, and what sort of new hoops we might need to jump through. I’m not going to start worrying about that now because I don’t know what it’s going to be. – Don’t get me wrong: Brexit will be disastrous on so many levels, especially now, piling onto the coronavirus crisis. And of course it’s also a little bit disappointing… I’ve lived in this country for 13 years and I feel like I made a nice contribution, doing science, paying taxes, playing music. And then all these people feel that someone like me shouldn’t be here because we’re a burden on the country and they’d rather pull up the drawbridge; and they think it’s worth taking all these economic consequences of a no-deal Brexit just to keep people like me out of their country. But if that’s what the majority voted for, then I just have to deal with this somehow. I’m reasonably optimistic that I’ll find some way to navigate these new circumstances!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; I get the impression that you are quite optimistic in general. Do you think this is a requirement for being self-employed?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I think it’s probably a requirement if you don’t want to live a life in misery. You have to be somewhat optimistic or at least relaxed about what the future might hold because the future is kind of uncertain. You’re not going to know what’s going to happen. If you worry about it, it will not change the fact that the future is uncertain. So you might as well say “I’ll jump down that bridge when I get there”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; If you don’t mind, let’s talk about some technical questions … after you set up a two-photon microscope in somebody’s lab, how do you quickly check its performance? Do you have a specific routine?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;The quickest performance check is to image a pollen grain slide. You check how the spiky pollen grains look like, whether you can section them nicely and how the field of view [FOV] is like. Once you’ve done it a few times, it is everything you need to get a quick qualitative idea of whether everything is working fine. If you want to do it more quantitatively then you obviously want to image beads, you want to check your field flatness, you want to get your precise FOV measurements with some grids, and so on. We have a routine that we’re working with that we constantly improve, but in the majority of cases that’s not even necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; I think there are some companies which sell special calibration slides or samples. When would this be useful, or do you think it is overkill?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I would love to use those, but they are not really suitable for 2P. You are talking about the Argolight probes?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; So, they specifically mention that you shouldn’t be using them with 2P, or you use them at your own risk. Also, they cost about 8’000 euros. I don’t really want to spend 8’000 euros on something where I can quickly exceed the damage threshold, and that’s why I haven’t used them. I would love to have something like that if it’s available for two photon. In the meantime, I’ll stick with these electron microscopy grids and beads and pollen grains. – What are your thoughts on those, have you tried anything like that?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Several years ago I also wanted to check the field curvature for a two-photon microscope and borrowed a quite expensive calibration slide from the confocal microscopy facility, but I managed to destroy it, and that’s when I stopped experimenting. Usually, I just use beads and fluorescent plastic slides. Not so much pollen grains, because I have destroyed the slides several times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(curious) &lt;/em&gt;How do you destroy a pollen grain slide?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Just by leaving the slide somewhere in the setup, until something makes the glass break; which happened to me twice so far. I also made some simple pollen samples in agar, but that’s not possible in winter or autumn. So I’m usually sticking to beads. But in principle I agree, pollen slides are ideal, you quickly find the samples and you can also check how the fluorescence yield changes across the FOV. Do you make your own pollen grain slides?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; We’re using pollen slides from Carolina Biological Supply Company. They make these ready-made pollen grain slides for schools and educational settings and the slide is like five dollars or something.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; I didn’t know they were so cheap! The first scanning confocal microscope that I used [a Leica SP5] had come with a pollen slide, and I had been instructed to treat the slide very carefully, because it was so expensive… So it’s good to know that it can be really cheap! – Just another question about two-photon microscopes: which preamplifier would you recommend for a standard resonant scanning two-photon microscope?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; We often use the Thorlabs preamps, the TIA60, and we also use the Thorlabs PMTs with the built-in preamps, which is quite convenient. You control them through USB, and you can set the amplifier bandwidth in software.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;I thought the bandwidth was fixed at 60 MHz?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, for the TIA60 preamps, it’s fixed at 60 MHz. For the PMTs with the built-in preamplifiers, you can choose between, I think, 80 MHz, 2.5 MHz and 200 kHz. When we need higher bandwidth for something, then we would use Femto preamps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Which one is your preferred preamp from Femto?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I use the 400 MHz one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-blue-color has-text-color&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;&quot;&gt;“For me, cleaning always starts with these little rubber ball dust blowers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s talk about objectives… If you were postdoc in a lab and could choose any objective for testing, which one would you choose?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I had a Nikon 25x NA1.1 when I was in Troy’s lab, and that’s a really nice objective. For the typical applications I was working at – population calcium imaging – that’s just a beautiful objective. I wouldn’t really need to try anything else. I’m sure there are other applications that would benefit from some of these newer Olympus long working distance objectives, but it’s so application specific, and there’s good uses for all of them. So, without having a particular experiment in mind, it would be difficult to answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; For these Olympus objectives, I think the working distance is something like 4 or 8 mm. Does the 8 mm make any sense for neuroscience applications?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; Again, it depends on your application, right? These objectives were primarily designed for cleared brains, where you don’t have much of a choice, you either use a long working distance or you’re not imaging all of it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Ok, I didn’t know that it was for designed for cleared brains. Now, this makes much more sense to me. – Speaking about objectives, how do you usually clean optical elements? Do you use tap water or distilled water, or can you recommend any other protocols?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; For me, cleaning always starts with these little rubber ball dust blowers. You just try to blow everything off that might be there. If that doesn’t work with the blower, you get out the compressed air can. From there, we’ll go to distilled water, and then Purosol. If I can’t get it off with that, I would go to isopropyl alcohol, and then to methanol. But we’re usually dealing with new microscopes, so in the vast majority of cases, we don’t have to go past the compressed air can.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;What do you do with dichroics if they’re dirty or if there’s sticky dust on top of them? Is there anything you can do?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I wouldn’t really want to go far beyond the distilled water on a dichroic. If I can’t get it off with that, I might try the Purosol, but we don’t encounter dirty dichroics very often, because most of the optics we’re working with are brand new.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Another question about 2P microscopes: I was always wondering about a proper way to test the alignment and performance of collection optics. How do you check whether collection optics are properly aligned?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I want to capture all the light that’s coming out of the back aperture of the objective. So, if you just put some light source and a diffuser under the objective – that can be the LED on a phone with a bit of lens tissue on top as a diffuser –, you’ll get a large cone of light coming out the back aperture. Then you screw in a little target at the position where your PMT will be sitting. You should see a spot right in the center that has the size of the PMT sensor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Just to repeat, it’s important to remove the PMT in this case, right?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, you need to remove the PMT and put a target in its place. If you want to do it more quantitatively, it gets difficult. You could use a calibrated light source and count how many photons you get through and compare that over many microscopes and so on. But I don’t think anyone is doing that in practice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-blue-color has-text-color&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;&quot;&gt;“I don’t want to tell someone how to align a laser, I rather want to be present when they figure it out themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Let’s assume a customer writes to you that there’s a problem with their two-photon system, “because the signal becomes weaker”. This is something I also often hear from less experienced colleagues or friends who ask for some help with their setup. What would be your first guess if you don’t know anything else?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; In the first instance I would think of it as a great opportunity to help someone to think systematically about the problem. Because if all they tell me is that “the signal becomes weaker”, then they haven’t really thought about how to communicate a problem in such a way that the other person can do something with it. I would need to know so much more , for example: what’s the signal? what’s the system? what are you measuring? have you done the same experiment over a year, and every day it gets a little bit weaker?, or is that happening within the same animal, or within the same slice? … there’s a thousand different questions. I need to find out what the person means by “signal”, what the person means by “becomes”, what they mean by “weaker”. It’ll be beneficial for that person, and for me, if I can teach them how to clarify their thoughts to themselves, and then communicate them efficiently. Maybe next time they know immediately why it’s becoming weaker simply because they’ve changed the way they think.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I enjoy it very much to help someone to clarify to themselves what the problem is. It’s very rewarding for the person to figure out the problem by themselves, and it’s rewarding for me to teach someone a problem-solving skill that they might not have had before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;I think you have also participated in some summer schools?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;That’s right, I’ve been at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://meetings.cshl.edu/courses.aspx?course=C-IMAG&amp;amp;year=19&quot;&gt;Cold Spring Harbor imaging course&lt;/a&gt; five times – which is great fun, a great location and great teachers. I’m also participating every year at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tenss.ro/&quot;&gt;TENSS&lt;/a&gt; in Romania, the Transylvanian Experimental Neuroscience Summer School, again a great team of people that are running it with great lecturers and great spirit among students and all the TAs and lecturers. I really enjoy teaching people and helping them to figure things out. I don’t want to tell someone how to align a laser, I rather want to be present when they figure it out themselves. I might nudge them in the right direction, but if I simply told them what to do, I feel I’d be depriving them of a joyful moment of revelation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;It can also be a bit dangerous to align laser beams, and especially invisible IR beams. To make the laser beam visible, do you use IR viewers?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I use them occasionally, but only when I have to, so only when I’m working with a fixed-wavelength laser. And even then I try to do as much as I can with viewing cards rather than the viewer itself. Although I tend to go back and forth a little bit between card and viewer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; For the tunable lasers, do you switch to visible wavelengths or what do you think about the pointing stability of those lasers?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I usually align everything in the visible range and then, once we switch to IR, I image a uniform slide and check if our alignment is nice and centered. The illumination on the slide tells you whether you’ve gone off a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; To clarify, I was thinking more about pointing stability when changing the wavelength of the tunable laser for example from 700 nm to 900 nm…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t think the changes are drastic. But we’re doing the final alignment through the actual scan head based on what we’re seeing on the computer screen from the fluorescent slide, and we’re doing that at 900 or 930 nm anyway. In that sense, the visible beam is only a first approximation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; But this also means that you have to be quite tall, because otherwise you cannot reach the adjustment screws of the mirrors and at the same time look at the screen to check the fluorescence of the slide…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;Well, you need some access to those screws and a clear visual path to the computer monitor. You can walk around the table and do it from the back, as long as you can see the computer screen, right?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes… probably I was just thinking about some situations in the past where I tried to do this myself and needed to stretch quite far to reach the adjustment screw and at the same time look around the corner to see the screen …&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you tried moving the screen?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Not really … okay, I think you’ve identified the problem, it’s just laziness from my side! – But one more question about objectives: what do you think about two-photon mesoscopes with FOVs of several millimeters? Are they more difficult to build or maintain? Do you think they will become more standard or is it just a trend?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;It completely depends on the application. If there are experiments that you can’t do with a standard FOV microscope, you need a wide FOV microscope. If you want to image two areas simultaneously with cellular resolution that are too far apart for a normal FOV, you don’t really have that much of a choice. A microscope like that is certainly more difficult to build, because you need custom optics for it, which are really expensive, and that is something that will prevent them from becoming really standard in every lab very soon. A lot of experiments don’t require such large FOV microscopes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;So you don’t think that these objectives or lenses will become much cheaper in the future and allow them to become more standard?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t think they’ll go down in price very much. And they’re also difficult to maintain, and you need custom pre-chirpers. You basically need a dedicated imaging engineer in the lab who’s maintaining those microscopes, and even if you buy it commercially, for example the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=10646&quot;&gt;2P RAM mesoscope&lt;/a&gt; from Thorlabs, you need someone who’s working with that microscope every day to monitor its performance and fine tune it and so on and so forth. I hope that we’ll see a few more mesoscopes popping up in the future, because there are very interesting questions that you can answer with them, and maybe the prices will come down a little bit. But I don’t think they’ll come down far enough for it to be a standard thing that everyone has.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-blue-color has-text-color&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;&quot;&gt;“I wouldn’t be surprised if a three-photon microscope is on the cards at some point. We haven’t done it yet, but if someone asks, I’ll be happy to build one.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Do you also have any experience with setting up confocal microscopes or light-sheet microscopes and, if yes, how is this different from setting up two-photon microscopes?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I have not set up a confocal microscope so far, but I have set up a mesoSPIM light sheet microscope that your colleague Fabian [Voigt] in Fritjof [Helmchen]’s lab has designed. It was a very different experience in the sense that this was probably the first time that we’ve built something where we had basically no input in the design, and we were following someone else’s instructions. That was a little bit daunting, simply because I’d never done it before, but Fabian’s documentation is just so excellent that it turned out to be not a problem at all, and in that sense it was not much different to what we usually do when building a two-photon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you also have any plans of building a three-photon microscope?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m going to build whatever people ask me to build. We’ve done a lot of 2p microscopes, but we’ve also built wide-field microscopes, we’ve built a mesoSPIM, we’re working on a microscope for in-situ sequencing, I’ve helped people with LabView coding. Whatever it is that people ask me, if I have time to do it and it sounds interesting, I’ll do it. And I wouldn’t be surprised if a three-photon microscope is on the cards at some point. We haven’t done it yet, but if someone asks, I’ll be happy to build one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; So, even if I gave you a lot of money to make you build a 3D AOD-based two-photon scanning microscope, would you give it a try? I’ve heard that it is extremely challenging to make this run stably.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I would certainly try it – and get the right people involved. I was actually a co-author on an AOD paper some ten years ago with people from Angus Silver’s lab. AOD systems are a little bit finicky, but with the right person, with the right project, with the right collaborators on board, I don’t see why someone who wants an AOD system shouldn’t attempt to build one. I’m sure that some of these teething problems that any new technology always has will be ironed out over the next few years&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;So you’re quite optimistic about the future role of AOD scopes for two-photon microscopy?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;For the right applications – yes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;As we mentioned you also provide your service in order to help your customers save costs. If a lab really wants to save money, would you recommend to buy a fixed-wavelength laser for two-photon microscopy? I’m also not sure whether there are already some 920 nanometer lasers around …&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;There are now a few manufacturers that build fixed wavelength 920 nanometer lasers, and if someone says, all I’m going to do with this microscope for the next three or four years is GCaMP imaging and I just want to have a workhorse for that, then that’s certainly a good option. If it’s a young lab that only has a single two-photon microscope in the lab, and they don’t know exactly what sort of projects might come along next year and what sort of dyes they might be using next year, then it’s a bit of a risk to bet all your money on a single wavelength. This is probably more something for labs that have another two-photon with a tunable laser, where they can do experiments in the red or where they can explore other dyes that aren’t excitable at 920 nm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have examples for companies which sell fixed wavelength lasers at 920 nm?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; Coherent are selling one now, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coherent.com/lasers/laser/axon&quot;&gt;Axon 920&lt;/a&gt;; Spark Lasers have &lt;a href=&quot;https://spark-lasers.com/compact-femtosecond-laser-biophotonics-alcor/&quot;&gt;a few options&lt;/a&gt; for 920 nm; there’s Menlo, a company in Munich that sells the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.menlosystems.com/products/femtosecond-lasers-and-amplifiers/ylmo930/&quot;&gt;Ylmo-930&lt;/a&gt;; Toptica have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.toptica.com/products/psfs-fiber-lasers/femtofiber-ultra/femtofiber-ultra-920/&quot;&gt;920 model&lt;/a&gt;, also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nktphotonics.com/lasers-fibers/product-category/koheras-single-frequency-lasers/&quot;&gt;NKT Photonics&lt;/a&gt; – there’s quite a few around now. I haven’t actually tried any of them yet, but it’s certainly going in a direction where we’ll be seeing these more often in the field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Another technical question – you mentioned it already: what’s your opinion on multiplexed acquisition? Will it remain a niche product like the mesoscopes, or do you think it will become much more standard?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; Again it depends completely on your application … if you want to image two areas simultaneously without having to jump between them – whether that’s on a mesoscope where you image two different brain areas that are millimeters apart, or whether you want to image a single neuron and you want to image soma and spines both with very zoomed-in resolutions, but without having to jump between them – then multiplexed acquisition can be the right technique. If you don’t have the right question for multiplexed acquisition, then there’s no point getting it. All of these things are only useful in a very particular context that depends on the scientific question that you want to answer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; I always thought that multiplexed acquisition might be particularly difficult to implement because it’s not only challenging in terms of hardware and optical alignment, but also the software to disentangle the two multiplexed photon streams is not trivial. I was thinking that this combination of both hardware and software challenges might be a bottleneck which prevents many people from doing it?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;Well… you can also de-multiplex the channels in hardware using an analog system. Spencer Smith and Jeffrey Stirman used a nice system in their 2016 Nature Biotechnology paper with a wide FOV (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27347754/&quot;&gt;paper link&lt;/a&gt;), where they actually had an analog photon-counting system and then just acquired with a standard data acquisition system. They didn’t need to change anything in software because all the photon counting was done in the analog domain. But now, with these gigahertz data acquisition systems, you can acquire the data fast enough, get the laser timing and then assign different acquisition time bins to different channels. Scanimage can do that now, so it’s not really a challenge any more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have an opinion about the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://vidriotechnologies.com/vdaq/&quot;&gt;vDAQ&lt;/a&gt; system of Scanimage? I think it’s not based on National Instruments hardware any more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve built a couple of microscopes with those systems, and they seem very nice, very user-friendly. There’s no obvious downside, although I haven’t had a chance to really observe them over the same time periods as I have with National Instruments for over 20 years. But I have very high hopes for these systems, and we’re using them as standard now. The only situation where we’re not using them at the moment is when we have to count photons, because the data acquisition speed is currently 125 MHz max on the vDAQ. But there will be a new vDAQ version coming out later this year, with high-speed acquisition that will then be suitable for photon counting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-blue-color has-text-color&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;&quot;&gt;“I had to fly to Okinawa to build a microscope, but I didn’t know whether my toolkit would be there, too.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; I see. Maybe, to finish up, some fun questions… or maybe not so much fun, let’s see. During your time at INSS, what was your most challenging project?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;One of the first microscopes we built was in Okinawa, Japan. Shipping all the microscope parts to Okinawa was a bit of a challenge. Three of the four boxes arrived without problem, but the box with my toolkit didn’t arrive and was completely lost for about a week or so. UPS didn’t know where it was. They had scanned it in Tokyo, but then lost track of it and had absolutely no idea where it was. I had to fly to Okinawa to build a microscope, but I didn’t know whether my toolkit would be there, too. I had lots of spare parts in the toolkit, and all sorts of specialist tools that were difficult to replace in the shortness of time. That was a challenge to my otherwise unshakable optimism … In the end, the toolkit did arrive and everything was fine; I built the microscope, no problem with that. But then I needed to ship the toolkit back, and UPS kept cancelling the booking and no one on the customer service hotline knew why. We eventually shipped it back with Fedex. It was all very annoying, and I then decided to get a shipping agent who’s now managing all of our shipping for us, and he’s been brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Okay, this sounds like a rough start…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes … having these useful conversations with UPS customer service … It makes my blood boil just thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;What was the most expensive device you destroyed by accident?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I don’t really know, I don’t remember.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; You never destroyed an objective?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I never destroyed an objective, never destroyed a laser; I’ve destroyed scan mirrors, ETLs, stuff like that, probably a few other items in that price range. But I move on from that pretty quickly. I always think of it as a tuition fee that I have to pay, and then I forget about the incident. But the knowledge of what not to do stays with me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Which skill do you wish you have learned earlier that would be of use for your current job?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;Hm, all of them! I would love to have university degrees in electronic engineering and optical physics and project management, computer science, business administration, and applied math. Almost every technical thing or business thing that you could learn at a university would be in some way useful to my current job. But I also have to be realistic about how much I can do with the available time. These disciplines have crossed my path sort of superficially, and I’ve picked up what I can. I wish I had a really solid foundation in all of them, but I have to live with my limitations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;This sounds quite modest, given your expertise in so many domains… if you had to pick one, what would you learn if you had one year for that?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; Probably math. I’d really like to go back to undergraduate level math and learn all the foundations properly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; From your long experience in research and as a consultant, what kind of advice would you give to students or postdocs who want to learn the skills which are needed to understand a microscope or, more generally, to set up experiments?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; You just have to start, just go and do it. If you want to set up a microscope, go online, google “how to set up a microscope”, and then click your way to the websites where you can find how to set up a microscope. Maybe someone recommends to go to a course, maybe someone recommends a particular Youtube video. You’ll find all the resources that you need. This is such a great time to be alive, because you can find everything that you need online. You can apply for courses like the CSHL course that we discussed about, or TENSS, or numerous other imaging courses. If you don’t get into any of those courses, you can still learn it all online and just start building. A lot of people now offer very simple 3D-printed parts to set up basic optics and teach yourself the skills. You don’t even have to wait until you’re a student or a postdoc, you can do that as a little school project when you’re 12 years old, because all the learning resources are online.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-blue-color has-text-color&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;&quot;&gt;“I would recommend to stop thinking about a career. I would recommend to think about just getting better and better at whatever it is that floats your boat.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;So you would encourage self-learning, because that’s the way to learn what you have learned yourself?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s one way that works for me. Other people have different working styles, and your own working style emerges when you start doing something.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; What would be your advice for young scientists like PhD candidates or postdocs who think about a career like yours?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I would recommend to stop thinking about a career. I would recommend to think about just getting better and better at whatever it is that floats your boat; if you work more like an artist or an artisan and just focus on improving whatever your chosen art or your chosen craft is, then you’re going to get good at it, and then you’ll enjoy doing it. And if you keep an open mind, intriguing opportunities will pop up. And if you pursue these opportunities whenever they present themselves, then you’ll end up with the very tortuous career trajectory that I have, that doesn’t seem to make any obvious sense from outside. But for me, internally, it had a very natural flow. You’re obviously also going to need a massive amount of good luck; but I don’t really have any advice on how to get lucky.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On a side note, for anyone who’s considering starting their own business or doing something on their own, there’s an old blog post written by a banjo player called Danny Barnes. He writes about how to make a living by playing music (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dannybarnes.com/blog/how-make-living-playing-music&quot;&gt;https://dannybarnes.com/blog/how-make-living-playing-music&lt;/a&gt;), and while the blog post is ostensibly about music, there’s a lot of advice that applies to any self-employed person, not just musicians; and also not just to self-employed people, it applies to anyone who is in some way in a largely self-directed job – which I guess is the case for most scientists. There are a few paragraphs in there that are more specific to music, but I think it’s just a very good read on how you want to conduct business and life with other people and make a living from it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m curious, and I’ll check it out! … I think it has become obvious by now that you’re a big music aficionado. On Twitter, you describe yourself, among others, as ‘Bluegrass Dobroist’. Could you explain this to somebody without any clue, like myself?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;A Dobro is an American instrument, it’s like an acoustic guitar that has an aluminium resonator cone built into the body. Originally, it was invented to make a normal guitar louder, a bit like a speaker cone that picks up the vibrations from the strings and projects them outward. The Dobro was invented in the 1920s to make the guitar &lt;em&gt;a little bit&lt;/em&gt; louder to be heard over orchestras, and it was kind of popular for a few years, until someone invented an electric guitar that you could just very easily make &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; louder, and then the Dobro fell into obscurity. It’s played in a lap style, and you’re not fretting the strings with your fingers like on a normal guitar, but you use a steel bar that slides up and down the strings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Since I did not fully understand the following explanations, he pulls out a Dobro and simply shows to me via video how it works to play a Dobro.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;And what is the meaning of ‘bluegrass’?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; Bluegrass originally comes from the American state of Kentucky. Kentucky has a certain type of grass that has a sort of a blue appearance, and that’s why Kentucky is called the bluegrass state. There was a band in the 1940s that came from Kentucky; the band leader was called Bill Monroe and this band was called the Bluegrass Boys. Bill Monroe and the Bluegrass Boys played a very new and unique style of acoustic country music, and then other people started copying that style, and eventually because of the name of the band the style became known as Bluegrass music, and that evolved into a whole genre of music. Now, there’s tons of bluegrass bands, and bluegrass music, bluegrass festivals, and there’s a Grammy for bluegrass music. So, from this one band in the 1940s a very huge branch of music has emerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Bruno Pichler and the Hot Rock Pilgrims.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Interesting, I didn’t know that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ll be most happy to talk a lot more about bluegrass music all day long! I love it – I’ve been really involved in this scene for the last 12 years or so, going to festivals almost every weekend – obviously not now with the pandemic, and generally a little less since I started the company and since we had a baby two years ago. I’ve got a lot of other things to do now, but I’m still very much connected to the whole music scene and to the guys in the band and all that. Sometimes during the time when I worked at Scientifica, I was playing five, six, seven gigs a month even though I was living here in East Sussex and drove an hour and a half or two hours into London after work to play gigs and come back during the night to be back at Scientifica in the morning…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;At the end, is there anything else you want to share?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP: &lt;/strong&gt;I want to give a quick shout-out to my team, Angelos, Eleanor, Mark and Simon, who are just a massive pleasure to work with.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, if people want any sort of clarification on the things that I’ve mentioned, if people are thinking about transitioning from academia to industry and there are questions popping up, send me an email or hit me up on twitter and I’ll be quite happy to answer questions and give advice!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Thank you. I think you gave already a lot of good advice here!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BP:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m glad to hear that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PR: &lt;/strong&gt;Thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The arXiv development team is pleased to announce a major release of the arXiv TeX compilation system, which is based on the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tug.org/texlive/&quot;&gt;TeX Live 2020&lt;/a&gt; update. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/help/tex&quot;&gt;TeX&lt;/a&gt; is an open source markup language that allows precision formatting of various aspects of academic writing, including mathematical formulas and bibliographies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This update, set to release on October 1, 2020, provides enhanced local add-ons and support for newer font sets. The development team also used this opportunity to address bugs and feature requests and further modernize how the compilation system is packaged and run. arXiv’s previous major release was based on TeX Live 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors should be aware that works submitted between now and September 30, 2020 must adhere to current arXiv TeX guidelines (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/help/submit_tex&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/help/faq/#tex&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Works prepared in accordance with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tug.org/texlive/&quot;&gt;TeX Live 2020&lt;/a&gt; are welcome starting after 8am EDT on October 1, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv accepts more than ten thousand articles every month, and continues to provide access to all arXiv papers since the service was founded in 1991. A stable TeX compilation system is critical to reprocess articles from TeX sources from any point in time. arXiv maintains all past TeX trees so that existing papers are processed using the TeX tree that was in place when the article was originally submitted. This preserves the original presentation of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/help/faq/whytex&quot;&gt;TeX has many advantages&lt;/a&gt; that make it ideal for the archives: it is plain text, compact, and freely available for all platforms, and it also produces high-quality output.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2020/09/22/simultaneous-calcium-imaging-and-extracellular-recording-from-the-same-neuron/"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;Calcium imaging is a powerful method to record from many neurons simultaneously. But what do the recorded signals really mean?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This question can only be properly addressed by experiments which record both calcium signals and action potentials from the same neuron (ground truth recordings). These recordings are technically quite challenging. So we assembled several existing ground truth datasets, and in addition recorded ground truth datasets ourselves, totaling &amp;gt;200 neuronal recordings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This blog blog posts contains raw movies together with recorded action potentials (black; also turn on your speakers for the spikes!) and the recorded ΔF/F of the calcium recording (blue). These ground truth data are a very direct way for everybody into calcium imaging to get an intuition about what is really going on. (Scroll down if you want to see recordings in zebrafish!)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recording from a L2/3 neuron in visual cortex with &lt;strong&gt;GCaMP6f&lt;/strong&gt;, tg(Emx1), from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/788802v1&quot;&gt;Huang et al., bioRxiv, 2019&lt;/a&gt;; a very beautiful recording. Replayed with 2x speed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recording from a L2/3 neuron in visual cortex with &lt;strong&gt;GCaMP6f&lt;/strong&gt;, tg(Emx1), from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/788802v1&quot;&gt;Huang et al., bioRxiv, 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Stronger contamination from surrounding neuropil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recording from a L2/3 neuron in visual cortex with &lt;strong&gt;GCaMP6f&lt;/strong&gt;, tg(Emx1), from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/788802v1&quot;&gt;Huang et al., bioRxiv, 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Note that single action potentials don’t seem to have any impact at all. – The negative transients in the calcium trace stem from center-surround neuropil decontamination (activity of the surround is subtracted).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recording from a L2/3 neuron in visual cortex with &lt;strong&gt;GCaMP6f&lt;/strong&gt;, virally induced, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23868258/&quot;&gt;Chen et al., Nature, 2013&lt;/a&gt;. From the left, you can see the shadow of the patch pipette used for recording of extracellular signals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Something completely different: recording from a pyramidal neuron in Ca3 with &lt;strong&gt;R-CaMP1.07&lt;/strong&gt;, virally induced, recorded by Stefano Carta, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1&quot;&gt;Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020&lt;/a&gt;. What appears as single events are actually bursts of 5-15 action potentials with inter-spike-intervals of &amp;lt;6 ms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recording that I performed myself in adult zebrafish, in a subpart of the homolog of olfactory cortex (aDp) with &lt;strong&gt;GCaMP6f&lt;/strong&gt;, tg(neuroD), in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1&quot;&gt;Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Around second 20, it is visible that even a single action potential can be seen in the calcium signal. However,this was not always the case in other neurons that I recorded from the same brain region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again a recording that I did in adult zebrafish, in the dorsal part of the dorsal telencephalon with &lt;strong&gt;GCaMP6f&lt;/strong&gt;, tg(neuroD), in&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1&quot;&gt; Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What can you do if you want to detect single isolated action potentials with calcium imaging? GCaMP, due to its sigmoid non-linearity, is by often a bad choice and will be strongly biased towards bursts. Synthetic indicators, however, are very linear in the low-calcium regime. – This is a recording that I did myself in adult zebrafish, in a subpart of the homolog of olfactory cortex (pDp) with the injected synthetic indicator &lt;strong&gt;OGB-1&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1&quot;&gt;Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Although the temporal resolution of the calcium recording is rather low, the indicator clearly responds to single action potentials. As another asset, the indicator not only fills the cytoplasm of the neuron in a ring-like shape, which makes neuropil-contamination much less of an issue compared to GCaMPs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another recording that I performed in adult zebrafish, in a subpart of the homolog of olfactory cortex (pDp) with the injected synthetic indicator &lt;strong&gt;Cal-520&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1&quot;&gt;Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020&lt;/a&gt;. This indicator is much more sensitive compared to OGB-1, but also diffuses less well after bolus injection. – These two minutes of recording only contain 4 spikes (this brain region really is into low firing rates in general), but you can clearly see all of them. If this were a GCaMP recording, you would probably see only a flat line throughout the entire recording.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is not easy when people start listening to all the nonsense you talk. Suddenly, there are many more opportunities and enticements than one can ever manage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Michael Levitt, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2013/levitt/biographical/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nobel Prize in Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1990 Glendon MacGregor, a restaurant waiter in Pretoria, South Africa, set up an elaborate hoax in which he posed as the crown prince of Liechtenstein to organize for himself a state visit to his own country. Amazingly, the ruse lasted for two weeks, and during that time MacGregor was wined and dined by numerous South African dignitaries. He had a blast in his home town, living it up in a posh hotel, and enjoying a trip to see the Blue Bulls in Loftus Versfeld stadium. The story is the subject of  the 1993 Afrikaans film “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438954/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Die Prins van Pretoria&lt;/a&gt;” (The Prince of Pretoria). Now, another Pretorian is at it, except this time not for two weeks but for several months. And, unlike MacGregor’s hoax, this one does not just embarrass a government and leave it with a handful of hotel and restaurant bills. This hoax risks lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Levitt&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Michael Levitt&lt;/a&gt;, a Stanford University Professor of structural biology and winner of  the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2013, wants you to believe the COVID-19 pandemic is over in the US. He claimed it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1287036738565738496?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ended on August 22nd, with a total of 170,000 deaths&lt;/a&gt; (there are now over 200,000 with hundreds of deaths per day). He claims those 170,000 deaths &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1262799080402628608?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;weren’t even COVID-19 deaths&lt;/a&gt;, and since &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdnwp.tonyrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EuroMOMO_Influenza_and_COVID19_Have_Similar_Total_and_Age_Range_Excess_Deaths.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the virus is not very dangerous&lt;/a&gt;, he suggests you infect yourself. How? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1278561306006691845?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;He proposes you set sail on a COVID-19 cruise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Royal Caribbean Wonder of the Sea world's largest cruise ship under  construction - Business Insider&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;377&quot; src=&quot;https://i.insider.com/5f5a54307ed0ee001e25e8b1?width=1100&amp;amp;format=jpeg&amp;amp;auto=webp&quot; width=&quot;503&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levitt’s lunacy began with an attempt to save the world from epidemiologists. Levitt presumably figured this would not be a difficult undertaking, because, he has noted, &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot;&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gummibear737/status/1279167888038023170?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;epidemiologists see their job not as getting things correct&lt;/a&gt;“. I guess he figured that he could do better than &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; On&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot;&gt; February 25th of this year, at a time when there had already been 2,663 deaths due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in China but before the World Health Organization had declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, he delivered what sounded like good news. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202002/25/WS5e545c76a310128217279f34.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;He predicted that the virus had almost run its course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot;&gt;, and that the final death toll in China would be 3,250. This turned out to be a somewhat optimistic prediction. As of the writing of this post (September 21, 2020), there have been 4,634 reported COVID-19 deaths in China, and there is reason to believe that the actual number of deaths has been far higher (see, e.g. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20116012v2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;He et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30089-X/fulltext&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tsang et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/china-concealed-extent-of-virus-outbreak-u-s-intelligence-says&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wadham and Jacobs, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of publishing his methods or waiting to evaluate the veracity of his claims, Levitt signed up for multiple media interviews. Emboldened by “interest in his work” (who doesn’t want to interview a Nobel laureate?), he started making more predictions of the form “COVID-19 is not a threat and the pandemic is over”. On March 20th he said that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/nobel-laureate-israel-will-have-no-more-than-ten-coronavirus-deaths-621407&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he will be surprised if the number of deaths in Israel surpasses 10&lt;/a&gt;“. Unfortunately, there have been 1,256 COVID-19 deaths in Israel so far with a massive increase in cases over the past few weeks and no end to the pandemic in sight. On March 28th, when Switzerland had 197 deaths, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1243929765876301825?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;predicted the pandemic was almost over and would end with 250&lt;/a&gt;. Switzerland are now seen 1,762 deaths and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelocal.ch/20200915/worst-infection-rate-in-switzerland-vaud-to-introduce-new-lockdown-measures-from-thursday&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a recent dramatic increase in cases has overwhelmed hospitals in some regions leading to new lockdown measures&lt;/a&gt;. Levitt’s predictions have come loose and fast. On June 28th &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1277278261979090945?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he predicted deaths in Brazil would plateau at 98,000&lt;/a&gt;. There have been over 137,000 deaths in Brazil with hundreds of people dying every day now. In Italy he predicted on March 28th that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1243905625714831363?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the pandemic was past its midpoint and deaths would end at 17,000 – 20,000.&lt;/a&gt; There have now been 35,707 deaths in Italy. The way he described the situation in the country at the time, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/surprising-reason-northern-italy-crematoria-are-overwhelmed&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;crematoria were overwhelmed&lt;/a&gt;, was “normal”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became aware of Levitt’s predictions via an email list of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iscb.org/iscb-fellows&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fellows of the International Society of Computational Biology&lt;/a&gt; on March 14th. I’ve been a Fellow for 3 years, and during this time I’ve received hardly any mail, except during Fellow nomination season. It was therefore somewhat of a surprise to start receiving emails from Michael Levitt regarding COVID-19, but it was a time when scientists were scrambling to figure out how they could help with the pandemic and I was excited at the prospect of all of us learning from each other and possibly helping out. Levitt began by sending around a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/am2437ywxnh4b84/CURRENT.Analysis_of_Coronavirus-2019_Data_Michael_Levitt.pdf?dl=0&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PDF via a Dropbox link&lt;/a&gt; and asked for feedback. I wrote back right away suggesting he distribute the code used to make the figures, make clear the exact versions of data he was scraping to get the results (with dates and copies so the work could be replicated), suggested he add references and noted there were several typos (e.g. the formula &lt;img alt=&quot;D_n = C_nP_0 + C_{n-1}P_1 + C_{n-2}P_2 + \ldots + C_{n-29}P_2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_n+%3D+C_nP_0+%2B+C_%7Bn-1%7DP_1+%2B+C_%7Bn-2%7DP_2+%2B+%5Cldots+%2B+C_%7Bn-29%7DP_2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=545454&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; title=&quot;D_n = C_nP_0 + C_{n-1}P_1 + C_{n-2}P_2 + \ldots + C_{n-29}P_2&quot; /&gt; clearly had wrong indices). I asked that he post it on the bioRxiv so it could receive community feedback, and suggested he fill in some details so I and others could better evaluate the methods (e.g. I pointed out that I thought the use of a Gaussian for &lt;img alt=&quot;P_n&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_n&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=545454&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; title=&quot;P_n&quot; /&gt; was problematic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial correspondence rapidly turned into a flurry of email on the ISCB Fellows list. Levitt was full of advice. He suggested everyone wear a mask and I and others pushed back noting, as Dr. Anthony Fauci did at the time, that there was a severe shortage of masks and they should go to doctors first. Several exchanges centered on who to blame for the pandemic (one Fellow suggested immigrants in Italy). Among all of this, there was one constant: Levitt’s COVID-19 advice and predictions kept on coming, and without reflection or response to the well-meaning critiques. After Levitt said he’d be surprised if there were more than 10 deaths in Israel, and after he refused to send code reproducing his analyses, or post a preprint, I urged my fellow Fellows in ISCB to release a statement distancing our organization from his opinions, and emphasizing the need for rigorous, reproducible work. I was admonished by two colleagues and told, in so many words, to shut up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Levitt did not shut up. In March, after talking to Israeli newspapers about how he would be surprised if there were more than 10 deaths, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-the-expert-who-says-israel-is-overreacting-to-coronavirus-1.8689010&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he spoke directly to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/a&gt; to deliver his message that Israel was overreacting to the virus (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/ioannidis-trump-white-house-coronavirus-lockdowns&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he tried to speak to US president Donald Trump as well&lt;/a&gt;). Israel is now in a very dangerous situation with COVID-19 out of control. It has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-has-highest-rate-in-world-of-new-coronavirus-infections-per-capita-tv/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;highest number of cases per capita in the world&lt;/a&gt;. Did Levitt play a role in this by helping to convince Netanyahu to ease restrictions in the country in May? We may never know. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/erlichya/status/1301637529406496770?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;There were likely many factors&lt;/a&gt; contributing to Israel’s current tragedy but Levitt, by virtue of speaking directly to Netanyahu, should be scrutinized for his actions. What we do know is that at the time, he was making predictions about the nature and expected course of the virus with unpublished methods (i.e. not even preprinted), poorly documented data, and without any possibility for anyone to reproduce any of his work. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot;&gt;His disgraceful scholarship has not improved in the subsequent months. He did, eventually post a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.20140814v2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt;, but the data tab states “all data to be made available” and there is the following paragraph relating to availability of code: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to make the computer codes we use available to all but these are currently written in a variety of languages that few would want to use. While Dr. Scaiewicz uses clean self-documenting Jupyter Python notebook code, Dr. Levitt still develops in a FORTRAN dialect call Mortran (Mortran 1975) that he has used since 1980. The Mortran preprocessor produces Fortran that is then converted to C-code using f2c. This code is at least a hundred-fold faster than Python code. His other favorite language is more modern, but involves the use of the now deprecated language Perl and Unix shell scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the methods proposed here are simple; they are easily and quickly implemented by a skilled programmer. Should there be interest, we would be happy to help others develop the code and test them against ours. We also realize that there is ample room for code optimization. Some of the things that we have considered are pre-calculating sums of terms to convert computation of the correlation coefficient from a sum over N terms to the difference of two sums. Another way to speed the code would be to use hierarchical step sizes in a binary search to find the value of lnN that gives the best straight line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study involving as it did a small group working in different time zones and under extreme time pressure revealed that scientific computation nowadays faces a Babel of computer languages. In some ways this is good as we generally re-coded things rather than struggle with the favorite language of others. Still, we worry about the future of science when so many different tools are used. In this work we used Python for data wrangling and some plotting, Perl and Unix shell tools for data manipulation, Mortran (effectively C++) for the main calculations, xmgrace and gnuplot for other plotting, Excel (and Openoffice) for playing with data. And this diversity is for a group of three!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr, there is no code. I’ve asked Michael Levitt repeatedly for the code to reproduce the figures in his paper and have not received it. I can’t reproduce his plots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mlevitt_np2013/status/1254853253457539072?lang=en&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Levitt now lies when confronted about his misguided and wrong prediction about COVID-19 in Israel&lt;/a&gt;. He claims it is a “red herring”, and that he was talking about “excess deaths”. I guess he figures he can hide behind Hebrew. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NuritBaytch/status/1256734540015587329?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;There is a recording&lt;/a&gt; where anyone can hear him being asked directly if he is saying he will be surprised with more than 10 COVID-19 deaths in Israel, and his answers is very clear: “I will be very surprised”. It is profoundly demoralizing to discover that a person you respected is a liar, a demagogue or worse. Sadly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2018/05/18/james-watson-in-his-own-words/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this has happened to me before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levitt continues to put people’s lives at risk by spewing lethal nonsense. He is suggesting that we should let COVID-19 spread in the population so it will mutate to be less harmful. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BillHanage/status/1307795936924577792?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This is nonsense&lt;/a&gt;. He is promoting anti-vax conspiracy theories &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1307634991325753344?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;that are nonsense&lt;/a&gt;. He is promoting &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1305791799492071425?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nonsense conspiracy theories about scientists&lt;/a&gt;. And yet, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/122618622/nobel-prize-winner-weighs-in-on-nzs-covid-strategy-from-a-poolside-in-portugal&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he continues to have a prominent voice&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not hard to see why. The article, similar to all the others where he is interviewed, begins with “Nobel Prize winner…”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the Talmud, in Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:9, it is written “Whoever destroys a soul, it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world”. I thought of this when listening to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aier.org/article/nobel-laureate-michael-levitt-on-the-lockdowns-i-think-it-is-a-huge-mistake/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview with Michael Levitt&lt;/a&gt; that took place in May, where he said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a real baby-boomer, I was born in 1947, and I think we’ve really screwed up. We cause pollution, we allowed the world’s population to increase three-fold, we’ve caused the problems of global warming, we’ve left your generation with a real mess in order to save a really small number of very old people. If I was a young person now, I would say, “now you guys are gonna pay for this.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;Person wearing a VR headset&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12117 size-medium alignright&quot; height=&quot;159&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/VR-300x159.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching a Virtual Reality video was found to be an effective decision-making aid for people making an advance care plan. Advance care planning offers people the opportunity to plan their future care and support, including medical treatment, while they have the capacity to do so. Legislation allowing advance care planning is relatively new in Asia and has been recently introduced in Taiwan. Taiwanese people must complete a consultation before formally documenting their wishes. However, health and legal literacy can be a barrier to people making fully-informed decisions about their future care. Wan-Ting Hsieh showed 120 people a short video in virtual reality that documented typical scenarios in end-of-life care, such as hospice home care and the withdrawal of life support. After viewing the video, participant’s preferences for not accessing the medical treatments shown and the ability to make a decision about their future care increased. The study provides evidence for how VR tools could be further rolled out as decision-making aids and bridge gaps in health and legal literacy for important decisions about their future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09293-1&quot;&gt;Changes in sedentary behaviour in European Union adults between 2002 and 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Watching TV&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12115 size-medium alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/Sedentary-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Sedentary behaviors rose between 2002 and 2017 in the European Union, particularly in men. Sedentary behavior is an important risk factor for mortality and continues to be a public health challenge with significant health, social and economic consequences. López-Valenciano &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;analyzed data that surveyed European Union adult citizen’s physical activity and sedentary behaviors. In 2002, half of those surveyed were inactive for more than 4.5 hours each day; by 2017 this had risen to 54.5%. The researchers suggested a number of factors could account for this increase in sedentary behavior, such as longer commutes and labor-saving devices at home and work. The authors also attributed people’s interaction with technology such as smartphones and streaming services with increasing physical inactivity. The study provides supporting data for strengthening public health policies and international efforts to tackle rises in sedentary behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Genomics&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-06940-0&quot;&gt;Analyses of key genes involved in Arctic adaptation in polar bears suggest selection on both standing variation and de novo mutations played an important role&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Polar bear&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12114 size-medium alignright&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/Polar-bear-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Genomic mechanisms behind the rapid adaption of polar bears to arctic environments have been revealed. Polar bears rapidly evolved several traits from its closest living relative, the brown bear, that has promoted the species’ survival in arctic environments. Castruita &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;studied the genomic mechanisms underpinning how these characteristics were selected in polar bears by analyzing the genomes of more than 100 polar bears and 33 brown bears. The analysis revealed that a combination of standing variation in ancestral gene pools and &lt;em&gt;de novo &lt;/em&gt;mutations in polar bear lineages may have promoted the rapid adaption of polar bears to arctic environments. The study provides a comprehensive assessment of the genomic mechanisms behind how polar bears rapidly adapted to the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05340-9&quot;&gt;Improving the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions during COVID-19: examining the factors that influence engagement and the impact on individuals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;People wearing masks at a bus stop&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12116 size-medium alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/Social-distancing-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Community compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions in a pandemic may be influenced by the perceived severity of illness in the community. In an effort to flatten peaks of COVID-19 infections, governments have introduced various non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, lockdowns, and the use of face-coverings. However, how much of a positive impact these interventions have relies on community understanding, engagement, and compliance. Seale &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;conducted a rapid review of the literature to study the factors that impact community engagement with government interventions. The emerging theme identified by the review was how can an environment be created that supports and promotes the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the community?

Registering a systematic review protocol promotes transparency, prevents bias, and duplication of work. Cochrane and other bodies recommend prospectively registering systematic review protocols but journals do not mandate it, contrasting with their registration requirements for clinical trials. Tawfik &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;surveyed 270 systematic review and meta-analysis authors to assess researchers’ knowledge and attitudes towards systematic review protocol registration. Survey respondents acknowledged a lack of knowledge surrounding obligation and importance about protocol registration. The study calls for collaborative efforts to raise awareness of the benefits of systematic review protocol registration in the research community.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/PHE-1-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)&quot;&gt;number 1 cause of death&lt;/a&gt; globally, with an estimated 17.7 million people having died from CVD conditions in 2015, representing 31% of all global deaths. In England in 2017, more than 124,000 people died from CVD&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/feed/#_ftn1&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Changing behaviors related to diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol intake can reduce CVD risk. The delivery of interventions targeting these behaviors also often requires healthcare professional (HCP) behaviors to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The NHS Health Check&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand the extent to which positive behaviors are influenced across the NHS Health Check pathway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHS Health Check (NHSHC), introduced in the English National Health Service (NHS) in 2009, is a national prevention program offered to adults 40-74 years old with the aim of helping them reduce their chance of having a heart attack or stroke through behavior change and, where appropriate, clinical treatment. Since then, national evaluations have highlighted the need to maximize the program’s impact by improving coverage and outputs. To address these challenges, it is important to understand the extent to which positive behaviors are influenced across the NHS Health Check pathway and encourage the promotion or minimization of behavioral facilitators and barriers respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date research has tended to focus on single populations, e.g. patients or GPs, and specific behaviors, e.g. attending an NHS Health Check. A synthesis of these studies would provide an overarching behavioral picture of those involved in delivery and receipt of NHS Health Checks and so provide the foundations for intervention refinement and development. Our goal was to apply behavioral science frameworks to: i) identify behaviors and actors relevant to uptake, delivery and follow up of NHS Health Checks and influences on these behaviors and ii) signpost to example intervention content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most frequently identified influences were physical opportunity including HCPs having space and time to deliver NHS Health Checks and patients having money to adhere to recommendations to change diet and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 37 studies reporting nine behaviors and influences for eight of these. The most frequently identified influences were physical opportunity including HCPs having space and time to deliver NHS Health Checks and patients having money to adhere to recommendations to change diet and physical activity. Other key influences were motivational, such as beliefs about consequences about the value of NHS Health Checks and behavior change, and social, such as influences of others on behavior change. The following techniques are suggested for websites or smartphone apps: Adding objects to the environment, e.g. provide HCPs with electronic schedules to guide timely delivery of Health Checks to target physical opportunity, Social support (unspecified), e.g. include text suggesting patients to ask a colleague to agree in advance to join them in taking the ‘healthy option’ lunch at work; Information about health consequences, e.g. quotes and/or videos from patients talking about the health benefits of changes they have made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the recommendations flowing from our findings reflect the types of interventions that we would expect on theoretical grounds to be effective, and this is not a review of effectiveness of interventions. Additional work needs to be done to investigate the extent to which interventions to promote NHS Health Check behaviors target the barriers and facilitators identified in this review. This work would identify any missed opportunities for intervention and inform intervention design and refinement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first study, to our knowledge, to apply theoretical models to studies focusing solely on influences on NHS Health Check behaviors and to make specific evidence-informed recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study, to our knowledge, to apply theoretical models to studies focusing solely on influences on NHS Health Check behaviors and to make specific evidence-informed recommendations for commissioners and providers, which should be considered as part of the forthcoming NHS Health Check review in order to ensure the program is implemented as effectively as possible for the next 10 years and beyond.&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/feed/#_ftn1&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is written by PLOS’ Chief Scientific Officer Veronique Kiermer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peer Review Week is a time to celebrate the outstanding work of reviewers across the scholarly ecosystem. But it also serves as a call to action to examine the systems we have in place and opportunities to improve. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This peer review week, the theme couldn’t feel more timely. Trust in science, and peer review more specifically has taken the spotlight as doctors, researchers, and policymakers around the world collaborate to rapidly expand and communicate emerging knowledge about COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the advent of preprints in biomedical sciences has created &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/kabux&quot;&gt;new challenges&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate findings outside the traditional framework of journal peer review, and high profile journal retractions have contributed to raise doubts about the effectiveness of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2020/06/04/lancet-retracts-major-covid-19-paper-that-raised-safety-concerns-about-malaria-drugs/&quot;&gt;pre-publication peer review&lt;/a&gt;. With the flood of information pouring in, public readers and researchers alike face the same question: how do I identify information I can trust? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does Peer Review Work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peer review has long been a staple of the credibility of scientific findings for &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1087/20140206&quot;&gt;researchers &lt;/a&gt;and for &lt;a href=&quot;https://pewrsr.ch/2Hgq31S&quot;&gt;the public&lt;/a&gt;.  The process embodies the norm of organized skepticism that helps generate trust in scientific findings—by testing the rigor of thinking and experimentation, and by providing authors with expert feedback to build on. But importantly, peer review is more than the traditional view of pre-publication peer review conducted behind closed doors. Peer review does not stop with publication—in many ways, it only starts there. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recently, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen researchers rapidly come together &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the publication of high-stake results and point out serious methodological flaws which have led to retractions of articles and withdrawals of preprints. Social media has been an unconventional, yet instrumental tool in coordinated reactions. Some have argued this is a failure of peer review, but we believe it’s actually a celebration of peer review in different forms. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A broader view of peer review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While post-publication peer review remains rare, preprints offer new opportunities to leverage the community in order to address the challenges and limitations of traditional peer review. For example, reviewers and editors commonly acknowledge that it is increasingly difficult to cover all the bases of expertise required to properly analyze articles that have become much more multidisciplinary. Preprint commenting while the article is under review is one possible solution &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/&quot;&gt;we’ve encouraged&lt;/a&gt; to address this gap, by opening up the opportunity for any researcher, anywhere in the world to volunteer their expertise, for consideration by the editor. While commenting on preprints is still rare, it could allow journals to channel within the traditional process the energy that the community already puts in scrutinizing new findings within their specialty before they are formally published in journals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Preprints and preprint commenting can also help with another challenge of journal review: speed. PLOS journals offer authors the option to post preprints on their behalf at submission—after minimal checks for any content with potential to cause harm—so their findings can be disseminated while the journal curation process takes place.  We also participate in initiatives like Review Commons to provide journal-agnostic reviews that can &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/09/partnering-to-streamline-review/&quot;&gt;accelerate the peer review process&lt;/a&gt; at the author’s destination journal and alleviate the strain of repeated reviews on the peer reviewer community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond these practical issues, we must consider systemic challenges and in particular the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/400515v1&quot;&gt;documented biases&lt;/a&gt; in peer review. At PLOS we acknowledge the need to improve the diversity of our reviewer pool to help mitigate such biases and we are &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/07/our-commitment-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/&quot;&gt;committed to this work&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency, transparency, transparency &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An important prerequisite for all peer review mechanisms to work as effectively as they can is transparency. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Transparency facilitates trust. Working to make every step of the research and publication process as Open as possible gives journals, peer reviewers, and the scholarly community more broadly, the means for scrutiny, and a clear understanding of limitations. At the same time, it gives readers deeper insight into the scientific process and the various checkpoints that uphold it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From an author’s perspective, increasing transparency means making all relevant data, code, methodologies, and reagents available so that the scholarly community—starting with reviewers—can validate and reproduce the findings independently. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/kabux/&quot;&gt;recent survey&lt;/a&gt; by the Center for Open Science indicated that researchers judging preprint credibility were influenced by cues related to open data, code and other openness measures, as well as independent verification of authors claims. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Publishing peer review reports as well is important as it makes evident what aspects of the article were (and were not) thoroughly scrutinized pre-publication. All PLOS journals now encourage their authors to publish their peer review history alongside the article, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/06/published-peer-review-1-year-across-plos/&quot;&gt;uptake is promising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peer review needs better recognition &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Transparency in peer review is also crucial to recognizing peer review as a first-rate academic output. It is time for this activity, essential to the scientific process, to be considered a scientific output in its own right and to take its due place in the context of research and researchers assessment. With published peer review reports, individual reviewers can choose to take credit by revealing their identity. But recognizing that there are circumstances that call for anonymity, even unnamed reviewers should have this opportunity, and tools like ORCID and Publons allow them to demonstrate their contributions as part of their academic profile. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s always more we can do to provide the motivation and support for reviewers’ work. Peer review transparency and other visual signs of recognition are a way to start helping researchers leverage their  peer review expertise to advance their careers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earning trust in peer review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite its challenges, the traditional journal peer review process offers important opportunities to ensure fairness in peer review. And journals have a collective responsibility to make use of these opportunities. First and foremost, we can ensure that every paper reporting a rigorously designed and executed study is peer reviewed—not only the high-stakes findings and the work of well known authors. We can also take proactive measures to limit bias, such as increasing the diversity of reviewer pools, and managing competing interests. We can foster consistent review criteria, and supplement the volunteer peer review reports with additional scrutiny for elements like statistics or ethical research practices. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In sum, I believe there are complementary benefits of journal-organized peer review and the process that can take place more organically in the research community post-publication—whether the publication is in a journal or on a preprint server. With more transparency in the system, we can take advantage of all mechanisms of peer review to decide what to trust, and importantly peer review itself can deserve our trust. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The subthalamic nucleus is a small collection of neurons situated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/directional-terms#ventral&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ventral&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thalamus&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., below the thalamus). It is a major component of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/subthalamus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;subthalamus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-rte-preserve-empty=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the subthalamic nucleus and what does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The subthalamic nucleus is considered part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/basal-ganglia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;basal ganglia&lt;/a&gt;. The basal ganglia are a group of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/subcortical&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;subcortical&lt;/a&gt; nuclei that are involved in a variety of cognitive and emotional functions, but are best known for their role in movement. The precise contributions of the basal ganglia to movement still aren’t fully understood, but one popular hypothesis suggests that the basal ganglia play a critical role in facilitating desired movements, while at the same time inhibiting unwanted and/or competing movements. To read more about the basal ganglia and this purported function, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/blog/what-are-basal-ganglia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The subthalamic nucleus is considered a critical component of basal ganglia circuits that are devoted to the suppression of unwanted movements. These inhibitory circuits are known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/indirect-pathway&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;indirect pathway&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/hyperdirect-pathway&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hyperdirect pathway&lt;/a&gt;. In both pathways, the inhibition of movement is thought to be traceable back to excitatory &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/glutamate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;glutamate &lt;/a&gt;neurons that extend from the subthalamic nucleus to stimulate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gaba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GABA&lt;/a&gt; neurons in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/globus-pallidus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;globus pallidus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/substantia-nigra&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;substantia nigra&lt;/a&gt;; these GABA neurons in turn exert an inhibitory influence over neurons in the thalamus that typically prompt movement when they’re excited. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watch this video to learn more about the indirect pathway, a circuit in the basal ganglia that includes the subthalamic nucleus and is thought to play an important role in the inhibition of movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The subthalamic nucleus’ role in suppressing unwanted movements may be critical even for the simplest movements. If, for example, you are reaching out to pick up a cup of coffee, your brain must not only activate the muscles necessary for the movement, but inhibit those that would counteract the desired movement. Indeed, even when you are sitting still, unwanted movements (like your hand jerking involuntarily up in the air) must continuously be subdued by your brain. It has been hypothesized that the subthalamic nucleus plays an important role in these types of movement inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s important to note, however, that the functions of the subthalamic nucleus (and basal ganglia as a whole) are not limited to movement. Recent research suggests the subthalamic nucleus may also contribute to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16249050/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cognitive functions like decision-making, attention, and working memory&lt;/a&gt; (among others). And the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16249050/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;subthalamic nucleus may be part of circuits that have important influences on emotion&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some of our understanding of these more extensive roles for the subthalamic nucleus come from studies involving &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/deep-brain-stimulation-dbs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deep brain stimulation&lt;/a&gt;, or DBS. DBS is a surgical procedure that involves implanting an electrode in the brain. Once the electrode is in place, it can be prompted to emit electrical impulses that are hypothesized to interfere with neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;DBS has been found to be especially useful in the treatment of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/parkinsons-disease&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. Parkinson’s disease is characterized by movement problems like slow, effortful movement, and difficulty initiating movements. It is believed that some of these movement-related symptoms stem from overactivity in the subthalamic nucleus. This increased subthalamic nucleus activity may lead to excessive inhibition of movement via the basal ganglia circuits mentioned above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thus, when the electrode in DBS is positioned in or near the subthalamic nucleus, turning the device on can disrupt the inhibitory actions of the subthalamic nucleus and facilitate movement. To learn more about DBS, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/blog//deep-brain-stimulation-parkinsons-disease-mechanism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;see this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;As mentioned above, the use of DBS has also helped us to appreciate the complexity of the roles of the subthalamic nucleus. Many patients who receive DBS experience not only an improvement of their Parkinsonian symptoms, but also develop side effects that include cognitive and emotional changes &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12371602/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;like memory disturbances and apathy&lt;/a&gt;. It has been proposed that disruption of the function of the subthalamic nucleus might be responsible for these side effects of DBS. It should be said, however, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12371602/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;variability in the side effects of DBS&lt;/a&gt;—as well as a poor understanding of exactly how DBS affects brain activity—makes it difficult to say this with certainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Regardless, the evidence collected to date suggests that the subthalamic nucleus is an important area of the brain for motor control and a variety of other actions. Future research will be needed, however, to fully understand the functions of this small—but important—collection of neurons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References (in addition to linked text above):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bonnevie T, Zaghloul KA.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;To record the activity from a  population of neurons, calcium imaging and extracellular recordings with small electrodes are the two most widely used methods that are still  able to disentangle the contributions from single units. Here, I would like to briefly mention two papers that try to connect these two approaches by comparing them more or less directly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wei et al., &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/840686v1&quot;&gt;A comparison of neuronal population dynamics measured with calcium imaging and electrophysiology&lt;/a&gt;, bioRxiv, 2019&lt;br /&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Update, 2020-09-15&lt;/strong&gt;: The paper just came out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008198&quot;&gt;PLoS Comp Biology&lt;/a&gt; just one day after the blog post!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al., &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.244723v1&quot;&gt;Reconciling functional differences in populations of neurons recorded with two-photon imaging and electrophysiology&lt;/a&gt;, bioRxiv, 2020&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both papers compare calcium imaging datasets and extracellular ephys datasets, try to connect the results and point out the difficulties in reconciling the approaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wei et al. &lt;/strong&gt;use datasets recorded in mouse anterio-lateral motor cortex (ALM). They first focus on approaches to reconstruct spike rates from calcium imaging data (deconvolution) and find several limitations of this approach. On the other hand, they find that a forward model that transforms spiking activity to calcium fluorescence data can reconcile most of these differences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors also provide a user-friendly website which can be used to explore the transformations between ephys and imaging data (also including datasets with simultaneous ephys-imaging): &lt;a href=&quot;http://im-phys.org&quot;&gt;http://im-phys.org&lt;/a&gt;. (Understanding the figures of the paper is however quite useful before exploring the website.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6583&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6583&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;screenshot-from-2020-09-14-21-19-33&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/screenshot-from-2020-09-14-21-19-33.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/screenshot-from-2020-09-14-21-19-33.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/screenshot-from-2020-09-14-21-19-33.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;692,383&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/screenshot-from-2020-09-14-21-19-33/&quot; height=&quot;370&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/screenshot-from-2020-09-14-21-19-33.png?w=692&quot; width=&quot;670&quot; /&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/840686v1&quot;&gt;Wei et al., &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; (2019)&lt;/a&gt;, used under &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/&quot;&gt;CC BY 4.0&lt;/a&gt; license (excerpt from Fig. 7).&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A large part of the paper focuses on high-level analyses (principal component analysis, decoding of behavior and decision). I would take it as an educational tale of caution which highlights wrong conclusions that could be made based on standard analyses. For example, the slow and variable decay times of calcium imaging data can lead to a dispersion of peak activity that was absent in the ephys data. This dispersion can smear out clearly timed activations of neuronal population into something more similar to a sequence (see Figure 7, of which I have pasted an excerpt above).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al.&lt;/strong&gt; from the Allen Institute, rather than investigating the effects on higher-level population analyses, focus their attention on the effects seen in single neurons. When comparing a calcium imaging and an ephys dataset recorded in the same brain region (visual cortex V1) in mice that do the same standardized tasks, what differences can be seen in the firing properties of single neurons?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Due to the high standardization requirements at the Allen Institute, their datasets are probably uniquely qualified to be the basis for such a comparison. Interestingly, they find a couple of clear differences. For example, extracellular ephys data suggest typical firing rates of around 3 Hz (see Figure 2A), which is almost an order of magnitude higher than what has been recorded and estimated from calcium imaging data (see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1&quot;&gt;Figure 7 in our preprint&lt;/a&gt;, which estimates spike rates of the same dataset).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors go to great lengths to use forward transformations (similar to Wei et al.) in order to reconcile differences seen for various response metrics (responsiveness, tuning preference, selectivity). However, their conclusion seemed to me quite a bit less optimistic compared to the Wei et al. paper. The authors go into more detail when discussing the potential reasons for the discrepancies, and focus on the recording methods themselves rather than on methods to transform between them. In particular their analysis of inter-spike-interval (ISI) violations in ephys recordings (which indicate that spikes from different neurons contaminate the recording of the neuron of interest) was, in my opinion, particularly interesting and convincing. I also really recommend to anybody the last paragraph of their discussion, from which I only want to cite their note of caution about extracellular ephys recordings:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this study, we have learned that extracellular electrophysiology overestimates the fraction of neurons that elevate their activity in response to visual stimuli, in a manner that is consistent with the effects of selection bias and contamination. – Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why I am writing about these two studies is that I have been working at the interface of calcium imaging and ephys myself, addressing the question, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1&quot;&gt;How much information about spike rates can we get out of calcium imaging data?&lt;/a&gt; Wei et al. and Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al. take a slightly broader perspective. And, in some way, they show how hard it is to reconcile two (methodological) perspectives on the same phenomenon. (I noticed this in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fmi.ch/research-groups/groupleader.html?group=119&quot;&gt;PhD lab&lt;/a&gt; as well, when it came to reconciling results from EM reconstructions of neuronal anatomy and calcium measurements of the same neurons.) Since almost any method in systems neuroscience is technically challenging, we often have in a single lab only a single perspective of a phenomenon, and I think it’s important to always be aware that the conclusions drawn from this perspective might be strongly biased.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In general, calcium imaging and extracellular ephys are extremely valuable tools to observe the living brain, and we better do anything to understand the properties and limitations of these tools. These studies sometimes might feel a bit like negative results and therefore not very attractive to those who want to advance neuroscience, and I therefore understand why not many are willing to undertake these projects. So I am glad to be able to highlight these two publications here.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/Tinnitus-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest, when most of us attend or take part in noisy recreational activities (e.g., nightclubs, concerts, playing musical instruments, indoor/outdoor sporting activities, motorsports) the last thing we reach for are hearing protection devices (e.g., earplugs and earmuffs). This is despite the fact that these activities can often range in loudness levels over 100 dBA, with the potential to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html&quot;&gt;cause hearing symptoms (e.g., dullness in hearing/tinnitus) after 15 minutes&lt;/a&gt; of continuous exposure. This is one of the reasons why the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2015/ear-care/en/&quot;&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; estimates that over a billion teenagers and young adults are at risk of hearing symptoms due to recreational noise exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of hearing protection devices is recognized as a method of reducing noise exposure. However, the amount of people using these devices within recreational contexts just ‘some of the time’ can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722160/&quot;&gt;as low as ~5%&lt;/a&gt;, and even fewer people ‘always’ using them. Some people do tend to walk away from loud sources of noise, or go and take a break on a night out (e.g., regeneration break), and this is another method of protecting your hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to improve hearing protection behaviors (e.g., earplugs, earmuffs, regeneration breaks) through interventions it would be beneficial to know how effective previous interventions have been in recreational contexts, and what were the active ingredients (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK327617/&quot;&gt;behavior change techniques&lt;/a&gt; (BCTs)) of these interventions trying to bring about the change.  Knowing what BCTs have been applied previously, or perhaps not, can help future designers of hearing protection interventions to potentially improve uptake. We conducted a systematic review of any intervention studies that measured a deliberate attempt to increase hearing protection behaviors during noisy recreational activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what did we find? We found eight studies measuring behavior post-intervention, of which only three were experimental post-test designs (two randomized controlled studies and one quasi). The most common behavior reported was the use of earplugs, seen in all eight studies, with five having a small to medium effect (d ≥ 0·3 ≤ 0·5) at measuring an increase, or difference in earplug use – including all three experimental studies. The overall increase or difference in earplugs being used ‘some of the time’ across all eight studies ranged from 3% -14.6%, but with very few ‘always’ using earplugs people are at risk of acquiring hearing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of BCTs, across all studies we found a total of 17 different techniques had been deployed out of a possible 93 available from within the ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23512568/&quot;&gt;behavior change technique taxonomy version 1&lt;/a&gt;’, with the majority serving an intervention category of ‘education’ (e.g., information about health consequences). With so few BCTs coded it leaves a large scope to test previously unused techniques. However, all three experimental studies restructured the environment by providing free earplugs (e.g., adding objects to the environment), and each measured a small to medium effect for at least one recreational context – perhaps indicating that this should be at least considered for future interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the results tell us there are very few hearing protection interventions addressing recreational noise exposure, a global hearing health concern, and those that have tackled the issue have had mixed success. Further intervention studies should be conducted that employ randomized controlled designs, with use of systematic approaches to intervention development (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1748-5908-6-42&quot;&gt;the behavior change wheel&lt;/a&gt;), as this will help target specific behavior change techniques in an effort to increase hearing protection behaviors and raise effect sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will you be reaching for your earplugs the next time?&lt;/p&gt;

We all know that goats have complex vocalizations, but very few of us know what they mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the health and well-being of livestock, it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2019.00024/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;greater understanding of Farm Animal Cognition is also important&quot;&gt;advantageous to understand&lt;/a&gt; the emotional states conveyed by vocalizations, postures, and other behaviors. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004126&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Emotions in goats: mapping physiological, behavioural and vocal profiles&quot;&gt;2015 study&lt;/a&gt; measured the acoustic features of different goat calls, along with their associated behavioral and physiological responses. Twenty-two adult goats were put in four situations: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;(1) control (neutral)&lt;br /&gt;(2) anticipation of a food reward (positive)&lt;br /&gt;(3) food-related frustration (negative)&lt;br /&gt;(4) social isolation (negative)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Dr. Elodie Briefer and colleagues conducted the study at a goat sanctuary in Kent, UK (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buttercups.org.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Buttercups Sanctuary for Goats&lt;/a&gt;). The caprine participants had lived at the sanctuary for at least two years and were fully habituated to humans. Heart rate and respiration were recorded as indicators of arousal, so this dimension of emotion could be considered separately from valence (positive/negative). For conditions #1-3, the goats were tested in pairs (adjacent pens) to avoid the stress of social isolation. They were habituated to the general set-up, to the Frustration and Isolation scenarios, and to the heart rate monitor before the actual experimental sessions, which were run on separate days. Additional details are presented in the first footnote.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;audio controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0003347214004126-mmc1.mp3?attredirects=0&amp;amp;d=1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004126#dfig1&quot; title=&quot;Audio A1&quot;&gt;Audio A1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; One call produced during a negative situation (food frustration), followed  by a call produced during a positive situation (food reward) by the same goat (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004126&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Briefer et al., 2015)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behavioral responses during the scenarios were timed and scored; these included tail position, locomotion, rapid head movement, ear orientation, and number of calls. The investigators recorded the calls and produced &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spectograms&lt;/a&gt; that illustrated the frequencies of the vocal signals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-605iRERme5k/XOGnR2RkhdI/AAAAAAAAM14/EPB0MEnIDpMhrpmFEasKScRN5vfAuAQAgCLcBGAs/s1600/goat%2Bspectograms.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;283&quot; data-original-width=&quot;556&quot; height=&quot;202&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-605iRERme5k/XOGnR2RkhdI/AAAAAAAAM14/EPB0MEnIDpMhrpmFEasKScRN5vfAuAQAgCLcBGAs/s400/goat%2Bspectograms.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The call on the left &lt;b&gt;(a)&lt;/b&gt; was emitted during food frustration (first call in Audio A1). The call on the right &lt;b&gt;(b)&lt;/b&gt; was produced during food reward; it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;has a lower fundamental frequency (F0) and smaller frequency modulations.&lt;/span&gt; Modified from &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004126#fig2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Audio A1&quot;&gt;Fig. 2 (Briefer et al., 2015)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both negative and positive food situations resulted in greater goat arousal (measured by heart rate) than the neutral control condition and the low arousal negative condition (social isolation). Behaviorally speaking, arousal and valence had different indicators: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;During high arousal situations, goats displayed more head movements,  moved more, had their ears pointed forwards more often and to the side less often, and produced more calls. ... In  positive situations, as opposed to negative ones, goats had their ears  oriented backwards less often and spent more time with the tail up.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Happy goats have their tails up, and do not point their ears backwards. I think I would need a lot more training to identify the range of goat emotions conveyed in my amateur video. At least I know &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_Who_Stare_at_Goats_(film)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;ha, ha&quot;&gt;not to stare at them&lt;/a&gt;, but next time I should read more about their reactions to &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-014-0777-5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;‘Goats that stare at men’: dwarf goats alter their behaviour in response to human head orientation, but do not spontaneously use head direction as a cue in a food-related context&quot;&gt;human head and body postures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do goats show a left or right hemisphere advantage for vocal perception? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that the researchers have characterized the valence and arousal communicated by goat calls, another study asked whether goats show a left hemisphere or right hemisphere “preference” for the perception of different calls (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Baciadonna et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;). How is this measured, you ask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;u&gt;Head-Turning in Goats and Babies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head-turn preference paradigm is widely used in studies of speech perception in infants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Figure from &lt;a data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-action=&quot;back to article&quot; data-track-category=&quot;figure&quot; data-track-label=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2430#f4&quot;&gt;Prosody cues word order in 7-month-old bilingual infants&lt;/a&gt; (Gervain &amp;amp; Werker, 2013).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dB4B0eOuPtA/XOHB4Sd8egI/AAAAAAAAM2E/FdZSkoJoRfs9R-vvwE8pTHZ0z-wUp6ekQCLcBGAs/s1600/head%2Bturn%2Bpreference%2Bparadigm%2Bin%2Bhuman%2Binfants.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;654&quot; data-original-width=&quot;926&quot; height=&quot;226&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dB4B0eOuPtA/XOHB4Sd8egI/AAAAAAAAM2E/FdZSkoJoRfs9R-vvwE8pTHZ0z-wUp6ekQCLcBGAs/s320/head%2Bturn%2Bpreference%2Bparadigm%2Bin%2Bhuman%2Binfants.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don't know whether this paradigm is used to assess lateralization of speech perception in babies. In the animal literature, a similar head-orienting response is a standard experimental procedure. For now, we will have to accept the underlying assumption that orienting left or right may be an indicator of a contralateral hemispheric “preference” for that specific vocalization (i.e., orienting to the left side indicates a right hemisphere dominance, and vice versa). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;The experimental procedure usually applied to test functional auditory  asymmetries in response to vocalizations of conspecifics and  heterospecifics is based on a major assumption (&lt;a class=&quot; bibr popnode&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/#zoy022-B45&quot;&gt;Teufel et al. 2007&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a class=&quot; bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/#zoy022-B43&quot; id=&quot;__tag_746041107&quot;&gt;Siniscalchi et al. 2008&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;It is assumed that when a sound is perceived simultaneously in both  ears, the head orientation to either the left or right side is an  indicator of the side of the hemisphere that is primarily involved in the response to the stimulus presented.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; There is strong evidence that  this is the case in humans ... The assumption is  also supported by the neuroanatomic evidence of the contralateral  connection of the auditory pathways in the mammalian brain (&lt;a class=&quot; bibr popnode&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/#zoy022-B37&quot;&gt;Rogers and Andrew 2002&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a class=&quot; bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/#zoy022-B28&quot; id=&quot;__tag_746041121&quot;&gt;Ocklenburg et al. 2011&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The experimental set-up to test this in goats is shown below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-veONwSaj_Zk/XN55qA53IKI/AAAAAAAAM1s/jQV5bSRUBoUmvdF225yj-DkAdZZ_H7zZgCLcBGAs/s1600/goat%2Bauditory%2Bperception%2Bexperiment.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;426&quot; data-original-width=&quot;633&quot; height=&quot;268&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-veONwSaj_Zk/XN55qA53IKI/AAAAAAAAM1s/jQV5bSRUBoUmvdF225yj-DkAdZZ_H7zZgCLcBGAs/s400/goat%2Bauditory%2Bperception%2Bexperiment.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;A feeding bowl (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;filled with a tasty mixture of dry pasta and hay) was fixed at the center of the arena opposite to the entrance. The speakers were positioned at a distance of 2 meters from the right and left side of the bowl and were aligned to it. 'X' indicates the position of the Experimenter. &lt;b&gt;Modified from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004126#fig2&quot;&gt;Fig. 2 (&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/&quot;&gt;Baciadonna et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004126#fig2&quot;&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four types of vocalizations were played over the speakers: food anticipation, food frustration, isolation, and dog bark (presumably a negative stimulus). Three examples of each vocalization were played, each from a different and unfamiliar goat (or dog).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The various theories of brain lateralization of emotion predicted different results. The &lt;b&gt;right hemisphere model &lt;/b&gt;predicts right hemisphere dominance (head turn to the left) for high-arousal emotion regardless of valence (food anticipation, food frustration, dog barks). In contrast, the &lt;b&gt;valence model&lt;/b&gt; predicts right hemisphere dominance for processing negative emotions (food frustration, isolation, dog barks), and left hemisphere dominance for positive emotions (food anticipation). The &lt;b&gt;conspecific model&lt;/b&gt; predicts left hemisphere dominance for all goat calls (“familiar and non-threatening”) and right hemisphere dominance for dog barks. Finally, a &lt;b&gt;general emotion model&lt;/b&gt; predicts right hemisphere dominance for all of the vocalizations, because they're all emotion-laden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results sort of supported the &lt;b&gt;conspecific model&lt;/b&gt; (according to the authors), if we now accept that dog barks are actually “familiar and non-threatening” [&lt;i&gt;if I understand correctly&lt;/i&gt;]. The head-orienting response did not differ significantly between the four vocalizations, and there was a slight bias for head orienting to the right (p=.046 vs. chance level), when collapsed across all stimulus types.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time to resume feeding after hearing a vocalization (a measure of fear) didn't differ between goat calls and dog barks, so the authors concluded that “goats at our study site may have been habituated to dog barks and that they did not perceive dog barks as a serious threat.” However, if a Siberian Husky breaks free of its owner and runs around a fenced-in rent-a-goat herd, chaos may ensue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Methodological details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“(1) During the control situation, goats were left unmanipulated in a pen with hay (‘Control’). This situation did not elicit any calls, but allowed us to obtain baseline values for physiological and behavioural data. (2) The positive situation was the anticipation of an attractive food reward that the goats had been trained to receive during 3 days of habituation (‘Feeding’). (3) After goats had been tested with the Feeding situation, they were tested with a food frustration situation. This consisted of giving food to only one of the goats in the pair and not to the subject (‘Frustration’). (4) The second negative situation was brief isolation, out of sight from conspecifics behind a hedge. For this situation, goats were tested alone and not in a pair (‘Isolation’).”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dantgilbert/status/470199929626193921&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;those shameless little bullies&quot;&gt;replication police&lt;/a&gt; will certainly go after such a marginal significance level, but I would like to see them organize a “Many Goats in Many Goat Sanctuaries” &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/wx7ck/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;replication project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baciadonna L, Nawroth C, Briefer EF, McElligott AG.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;Despite much ado about the #metoo movement in recent years, the crisis of sexual harassment in academia persists without an end in sight. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org/index.php/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;academic sexual misconduct database&lt;/a&gt; now lists 1,051 cases, each of them a tragedy of trauma, unspeakable violations of victims, and dreams destroyed. I’ve written previously about two cases listed in the database (&lt;a href=&quot;https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2018/11/28/yuval-peres/&quot;&gt;Yuval Peres&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2018/01/17/terry-speed-a-male-feminist/&quot;&gt;Terry Speed&lt;/a&gt;). Now, I feel compelled to write about yet another sexual harassment case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://uwm.edu/engineering/people/dumitrescu-ph-d-adrian/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Adrian Dumitrescu&lt;/a&gt; is a professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. I have known of his work for many years, as we have a shared interest in extremal combinatorics, having both worked on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2000-37-04/S0273-0979-00-00877-6/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Erdös-Szekeres “Happy Ending Problem”&lt;/a&gt;. Last week a Facebook post was brought to my attention, in which a graduate student describes a horrible case of sexual harassment by Prof. Dumitrescu that occurred during a conference in Boston in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This student filed a Title IX complaint with the University of Wisconsin, and I have a copy of the report. The Office of Equity and Diversity (EDS) that investigated the case found that “Based on the totality of the circumstances, the information obtained pursuant to this investigation, and for all the reasons set forth above, EDS concludes that there is sufficient evidence to support a finding, by preponderance of the evidence, of sexual harassment against the Respondent [Prof. Dumitrescu].” Furthermore, the report states that “based on the seriousness of the Respondent’s conduct, EDS believes that disciplinary action is warranted in this matter, and recommends that the Provost refer this case for imposition of discipline”. As I write this post, Prof. Dumitrescu is still listed as a professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notably, after being sexually harassed by the Respondent, and before filing a report with Title IX, the student consulted her Ph.D. advisor. The report describes his response as follows: “[he] told her that the Respondent had a ‘high reputation’ in the field and it was better to ‘avoid trouble’ and not to report her concerns.” And yet she had the courage to report the case, despite the attempt to silence her, and having being threatened by the Respondent, as he coerced her to sleep with him, that if she did not acquiesce to his demands he would not conduct research with her and he might prevent senior scholars at her university from working with her.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The report details how the sexual harassment impacted the complainant’s research progress and mental well-being. Yet again, a talented young scientist finds herself with debilitating trauma, a career in jeopardy, and powerless in the face of an establishment that excuses harassers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The details of this case are of course different than every other sexual harassment case. Each is tragic in its own way. And yet elements of what happened here are to be found in all sexual harassment cases. Power imbalance. Coercion. Threats. Silencing of the victim. Inaction. Banal injustice. This will be case number 1,052 in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org/index.php/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;academic sexual misconduct database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We must do better.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/635333678/0/oupblogpsychology~The-role-of-masculinity-in-reforming-police-departments/"/>

		<updated>2020-09-10T09:30:56+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;For decades there have been murders of unarmed black people by the police, which in recent years has been exposed and protested by the #BlackLivesMatter movement. This summer, unprecedented numbers of protesters have voiced their outrage in response to the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, the very recent and utterly senseless shooting of Jacob Black, and countless other acts of violence. Many mayors have announced plans for reform. The protests have rightly focused on the roles of race and racism in police brutality, but more attention needs to be given to the role of gender, particularly as municipalities seek to repair the police force to avoid this unnecessary use of force and violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data from the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department in California, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093854807313995?journalCode=cjbb&amp;amp;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2008 study&lt;/a&gt; found that male officers were three times more likely to commit unwarranted shootings than their female counterparts. Additionally, white male police officers were 57% more likely than Latino male officers to commit such a shooting. These statistics refer to the group that constitutes the majority of police officers in America—white men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even more importantly, the culture of police departments tends to be macho and hyper-masculine—&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J012v16n03_01&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a culture which glorifies violence&lt;/a&gt;. This has always been the case but it has intensified as police departments across the county have moved from the community policing approach to militarization, aided by federal grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While among the general public masculinity is seen as synonymous with being male, psychologists view it differently—as a set of social norms, in this case norms for how boys and men should think, act, and feel. Masculinity is problematic in that that most boys are made to feel that they must conform to gender norms—that is, act in ways consistent with their gender. Masculinity is presented as obligatory for most boys, and most &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1037/a0037262&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;boys feel they have no other choice but to conform to masculine norms&lt;/a&gt;. This is not true for girls, who are given much more flexibility and latitude when it comes to their performance of gender than are boys. Furthermore, one of the principal functions of masculinity is to establish several hierarchies: of men over women, of white men over men of color, and of straight cisgender men over gay, bisexual, and transgender men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To move away from the macho and hyper-masculine culture, police forces must diversify—not only in race but in gender—their ranks and leadership. The presence of many more women, openly LGBTQ people, and non-white officers on the police force, and deploying training designed to heighten awareness of masculinity and its relationship to violence, will be crucial in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most boys are expected to conform to masculinity norms, most adult men come to accept who they are, even if they do not meet the masculinity ideals. Masculinity is, after all, a tough standard. That is, they come to terms with the messages from their childhoods and recognize that their unique personalities do not fit or need to fit the ideal in all ways, perhaps saying to themselves “I am not the most masculine guy in the world but that’s OK.” A smaller group feels deeply ashamed of themselves for violating the masculine norms. Experimental research using the “precarious manhood” paradigm has shown that &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721411402669&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;such men, when their masculinity is threatened, tend to respond with aggression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research that has been conducted over the past 40+ years shows that one or another scale that measures masculinity is correlated with one or another harmful outcome, many related to violence. Since most adult men do not conform to masculine norms, what accounts for these harmful outcomes? One source is the group of men who respond to threats to their masculinity aggressively. In addition, masculinity’s destructive outcomes also arise from those men who “check all the boxes,” and conform to masculine norms to the greatest extent. These are the men whom we might label as hyper-masculine. Both groups of men tend to populate police departments as currently constituted. Their influence must be diluted by diversifying police forces.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/little-boy-1635065_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adverse childhood experiences related to negative health outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As researchers, we often try to pinpoint the causes of negative outcomes in adults. What factors contribute to obesity? What about heart disease? Why are some people more prone to depression and anxiety while others are not? Surely it is not random chance why some individuals are more prone to these outcomes while others are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While each outcome may be linked to something specific (i.e., a person’s chance of getting lung cancer increases exponentially if they smoke), there is one factor that has been linked to a variety of negative outcomes like lung cancer, heart disease, anxiety, depression, obesity, unemployment, divorce, and even poor athletic performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the factor that is linked to all of these outcomes?  The term is called “adverse childhood experiences,” or ACEs for short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, a researcher named Vincent Felitti ran an obesity clinic in California. Around 50% of the participants dropped out, while the other 50% successfully completed the program. He decided to interview many of the dropouts, and found a common theme: Nearly all of them experienced some form of sexual, physical, or mental abuse as children. Interviews from the group that completed the program revealed only a very small percentage reported the same abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Felitti eventually collaborated with a colleague, Robert Anda, in a large study of 17,000 individuals. In that study, Felitti and Anda identified eight domains of ACEs: physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, parental separation/divorce, interpersonal violence, incarcerated family member, family mental illness, and family substance use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the event, Felitti and Anda found that the more numerical experiences an individual had, the more likely they were to have negative outcomes as adults.  Essentially, every person has an ACE score, ranging from 0 (no adverse events before the age of 18) to 8 (adverse events in all 8 categories).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this said, public health researchers and practitioners in all areas of prevention/intervention (e.g., mental health professionals, substance abuse counselors, etc.), have been trying to develop programs which either 1. Limit the number of ACEs people have, or 2. Help people deal with their ACEs as adults in order to help lessen their effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where our recent article titled, “The Frequencies and Disparities of Adverse Childhood Experiences in the U.S.” published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helps advance the field of ACEs.  In the article, we collected the most comprehensive ACEs dataset to date: 211,376 adults across 34 states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over half (58%) of all participants experienced at least one ACE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study helps shed light on precisely who is at-risk for higher ACEs. We report several noteworthy findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over half (58%) of all participants experienced at least one ACE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost one-quarter (22%) experienced three or more ACEs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Women were more likely to experience ACEs compared to men&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black, Hispanic, and Multi-racial individuals were more likely to have more ACEs compared to White individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who identify as a sexual minority (lesbian, gay, or bisexual) were more likely to have more ACEs compared to heterosexual individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does this all mean? There are several implications to the study. First, the more we know about ACEs, the greater the chances we have in both preventing ACEs and lessening their effect.  Next, ACEs are not equally distributed amongst the general population.  Some groups have a higher likelihood of experiencing ACEs, making them uniquely more prone to negative outcomes due to ACEs. Having insight into which groups are particularly vulnerable to ACEs is helpful for professionals that work in fields dealing with the repercussions of ACEs (like mental health counselors). Knowledge about which groups have a higher likelihood of ACE exposure will aid in tailoring programmatic responses to these groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information regarding ACEs (including the ACEs questionnaire), see the Centers for Disease and Prevention’s (CDC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/acestudy/index.html&quot;&gt;page on ACEs&lt;/a&gt; with additional links and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

Should more be done to help improve their risk and overall health? What if clinicians could prescribe an exercise regimen? Are there additional hemodialysis specific benefits to exercising?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology &lt;/em&gt;publication, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-02021-2&quot;&gt;Bogataj et al.&lt;/a&gt; performed a randomised controlled trial to examines the effects of intradialytic cycling and functional training on dialysis adequacy and other biochemical parameters. Participants were divided into a functional training intervention group (with intradialytic cycling) and an intradialytic cycling only control group. For the first eight weeks, participants in the intervention group performed guided functional exercise training three times a week before each dialysis session and additional intradialytic cycling exercise. This included a warm-up, full range of motion exercises with additional weights, and a cool-down with stretching.  For the second eight weeks the same group took the functional training home to do on non-dialysis days. The authors concluded that in both groups the dialysis adequacy improved and was sustained through the entire study; however, additional benefits were found in the intervention group, with promising improvements in the participants’ total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The improvement in dialysis adequacy with exercise during hemodialysis is not new. In 2004, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dustri.com/article_response_page.html?artId=480&amp;amp;doi=10.5414/CNP61261&amp;amp;L=0&quot;&gt;Parsons et al.&lt;/a&gt; also conducted an eight week study looking at intradialytic exercise and found that there was enhanced dialysate urea removal. The physiology of how improved dialysis adequacy occurs is thought to be through an increase in muscle blood flow and increase in oxygen extraction, which increases capillary surface area and increases the exchange of substances from the tissue to the vascular compartment. This increased diffusion into the vascular compartment allows for substances like urea to be removed by dialysis.  Therefore, improved dialysis adequacy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/14/12/2927/1818764&quot;&gt;Kong et al.&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated a 14% increase in dialysis adequacy from 60 minutes of intradialytic exercise.  This increase is equivalent to increasing a dialysis session by 20 minutes. It would be interesting to find out how many of my patients would prefer cycling during dialysis for an hour rather than increasing their dialysis time. Would it be more cost effective to have everyone perform intradialytic exercise rather than increasing dialyzer size or time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would it be more cost effective to have everyone perform intradialytic exercise rather than increasing dialyzer size or time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Bogataj et al article, there was also improvement in total cholesterol and LDL for the intervention group. There is clear evidence for preventing major cardiovascular events and mortality with lowering LDL for those with normal or slightly abnormal kidney function. For patients with CKD and ESKD, it can still be controversial. Our guidelines do not advocate starting every ESKD patient on a statin but what about lowering cholesterol with exercise? This type of intervention for cholesterol improvement still needs to be studied over a longer period with examining cardiovascular outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If budget was not an issue, I might consider purchasing customized cycling equipment for my in-center hemodialysis patients and hiring a kinesiologist or personal trainer to perform rounds in the dialysis unit like our dietician and social worker. With time, I imagine we will have larger, longer duration studies that will further support the idea that a novel exercise prescription strategy has specific health benefits for patients with CKD.&lt;/p&gt;
