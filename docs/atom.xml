 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Deepak Panday will talk about a paper &quot;Minkowski Metric, Feature Weighting and Anomalous Cluster Initializing in K-Means Clustering&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper represents another step in overcoming a drawback of
K-Means, its lack of defense against noisy features, using feature
weights in the criterion. The Weighted K-Means method by Huang et al.
(2008, 2004, 2005) [5, 7] is extended to the corresponding Minkowski
metric for measuring distances. Under Minkowski metric the feature
weights become intuitively appealing feature rescaling factors in a
conventional K-Means criterion. To see how this can be used in
addressing another issue of K-Means, the initial setting, a method to
initialize K-Means with anomalous clusters is adapted. The Minkowski
metric based method is experimentally validated on datasets from the
UCI Machine Learning Repository and generated sets of Gaussian
clusters, both as they are and with additional uniform random noise
features, and appears to be competitive in comparison with other
K-Means based feature weighting algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AGreenburgh&quot;&gt;Anna Greenburgh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regret seems to be a fundamental part of the human experience. As James Baldwin wrote, “Though we would like to live without regrets, and sometimes proudly insist that we have none, this is not really possible, if only because we are mortal.” Expressions of regret are easy to find throughout the history of thought, and, as indicated in the Old Testament, intrinsic to regret is a sense of emotional pain: “God regretted making humans on earth; God’s heart was saddened”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the aversive experience of regret, traditional models of decision-making predict that people should to try to avoid it. But of course, the picture is more complex — we all have experienced the desire to know &lt;em&gt;what might have been, &lt;/em&gt;even if it leads to regret&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797620963615&quot;&gt;a study in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, led by Lily FitzGibbon at the University of Reading, finds that the lure of finding out what might have been is surprisingly enticing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41760&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across six experiments, the researchers employed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) in which participants are required to inflate a computer animation of a balloon. The more they inflate the balloon, the greater the participant’s payoff — but each balloon has a randomly assigned “safe limit” above which it pops, and the participant is paid nothing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In each trial, participants decided how many times to pump up the balloon and were then shown the trial outcome: whether the balloon popped (“bust” trials), or remained inflated thereby giving participants a reward (“bank” trials). After this outcome was revealed, they had the opportunity to seek “counterfactual” information — that is, feedback about alternative possible outcomes; in this case, how far they could have pumped the balloon safely in the trial and how much they could have won. Importantly, as the balloons’ safe limits varied randomly across trials, this information could not help performance later on in the task. Participants were asked to rate their emotional state, from sad to happy, after learning the outcome of the trial, and indicate whether this emotional state had changed after receiving the counterfactual information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined how often participants sought counterfactual information, as well as its emotional effects. They focussed their analysis on “bank” trials as these trials were expected to clearly elicit regret: counterfactual information on these trials normally signified a missed opportunity as the participant could usually have inflated the balloon more and therefore earned a higher reward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across all experiments, participants seemed to experience regret in “bank” trials: they felt significantly worse after receiving counterfactual information. Unsurprisingly, the greater the missed opportunity, the worse the participants felt. But even though this information elicited regret, counterfactual curiosity was high: participants requested feedback in 46% of “bank” trials across all the main experiments, and 71% in a replication study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, participants even spent money to receive counterfactual information: although counterfactual curiosity was higher when information was free, when they had to pay for it, they still requested feedback on 18% of bank trials. Similarly, in experiments where participants needed to exert physical effort to obtain counterfactual information, they requested feedback around half the time. This underlines how difficult it is to resist the motivational pull of learning about missed opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The counterfactual curiosity observed in “bank” trials also had detrimental effects on participants’ performance. After receiving such feedback, participants took greater risks on subsequent trials, which had a negative effect on the number of points won, particularly when this behavioural adjustment was large. This highlights a mechanism likely relevant to gambling problems: counterfactual curiosity can exacerbate damaging gambling behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While many regrets in life pertain to our own mistakes made in isolation, as social beings we continually fret over interactions with others. Of course, the BART is an abstract paradigm so the study cannot speak to regrets of a more social nature. While this is a question for future research, the strength of counterfactual curiosity exposed in the paper might suggest that many of us have a morbid curiosity to seek out regret in all forms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797620963615&quot;&gt;The Lure of Counterfactual Curiosity: People Incur a Cost to Experience Regret&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-astrazeneca-vaccine-blood-clots-brain-rare-cases"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3098481</id>
		<updated>2021-04-07T21:59:08+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;In another hiccup for AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, data suggest it is in fact linked to blood clots that have formed in the brains of some vaccinated people, the European Medicines Agency announced April 7.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The blood clots are incredibly rare, EMA experts say. But because COVID-19 itself is deadly and can put people in the hospital, the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks, they say. “We need to use the vaccines that we have to protect us from devastating effects” of COVID-19, Emer Cooke, executive director of the EMA, said in a news conference on April 7. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The EMA had previously concluded that the vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-astrazeneca-vaccine-blood-clots-safety-experts&quot;&gt;was not linked to blood clots overall&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/18/21&lt;/em&gt;). But experts were uncertain about 18 case reports of blood clots in the sinuses that drain blood from the brain, a rare condition called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or CVST.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Enough data has now accrued to implicate the jab’s involvement in those rare blood clots, meaning CVST and similar conditions should be listed as a possible rare side effect of vaccination, the EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee concluded after reviewing numerous cases reported in the United Kingdom and the European Union. As of March 22, countries had reported 62 cases of CVST out of around 25 million people who got the AstraZeneca vaccine. There were also 24 reported cases of clots in veins that drain blood from the digestive system, called splanchnic vein thrombosis or SVT. Eighteen of the people with CVST or SVT died. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s still unknown how the vaccine could cause blood clots. One potential explanation is that some people develop an immune response that attacks platelets, making them clump together, Sabine Straus, chair of the EMA committee, said in the news conference. That would make the condition similar to low platelet levels and blood clots sparked by an immune response to the anticoagulant drug heparin. One preliminary study of four people who died from blood clots after vaccination had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-362354/v1&quot;&gt;platelet-binding antibodies in their blood&lt;/a&gt;, researchers reported March 29 at Research Square, a preprint server. The study has not yet been reviewed by other scientists. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If that is the way those clots form, there are ways to treat them, Beverley Hunt, a hematologist at King’s College London, said in a call with reporters. A therapy called IVIG, which contains portions of antibodies that interact with platelets, given with non-heparin anticoagulants might help break up clots.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why the vaccine might spark clotting is also unclear. It could be related to the technology AstraZeneca used in the vaccine or something about the coronavirus protein the shot uses, Adam Finn, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at the University of Bristol in England said in a call with reporters. “We just don’t know at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A few people given other COVID-19 vaccines have also developed rare clots; for example, three people in the European Union and United Kingdom developed them after getting Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s jab. But those shots have not been not linked with clotting issues, Peter Arlett, head of data analytics and methodology at the EMA, said at the news conference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Determining how often people actually do develop blood clots after their shots is difficult, since the committee is relying on vaccinated people to report their symptoms rather than routine monitoring done by experts, Straus said. So far, the reported rate differs among EU countries. In Germany, for instance, the reported rate is around 1 case of blood clots per 100,000 people while it is around 1 case per 600,000 people in the United Kingdom, Straus said. Normally, there are 1 to 2 cases per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the numbers are hard to parse, the reported rate of blood clots post-vaccination is still lower than that of other common medications that carry risks of the same medical issue. For women taking oral contraceptives, for instance, the rate of blood clots is 4 cases per 10,000, Arlett said.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Although most of the rare blood clots have occurred in women younger than 60 years old, the factors that could put people at risk of forming clots remain unclear, Straus said. That’s in part because some of the records do not provide all the necessary information about the people who developed clots, such as age or gender. More women than men have received the shot overall in the European Union and United Kingdom, which could also skew the results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even without clear information on risk factors, many countries have placed restrictions on the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine. Some countries, including Denmark and Norway, have stopped using the shot. Others, like Canada and Germany, are using it only to vaccinate older adults. On April 6, the United Kingdom paused an ongoing trial of AstraZeneca’s vaccine in children 6 to 17 years old. U.K. officials now recommend that health experts offer other COVID-19 vaccines to people younger than 30 years old.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the United States, AstraZeneca plans to apply soon for emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/europe-oldest-known-humans-mated-neandertals-dna-fossils"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3098332</id>
		<updated>2021-04-07T15:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;When some of the earliest human migrants to Europe encountered Neandertals already living there around 45,000 years ago, hookups flourished.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Analyses of DNA found in human fossils from around that time — the oldest known human remains in Europe — suggest that interbreeding between &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; and Neandertals, who were on the fast track to extinction, occurred more commonly than has often been assumed, two new studies suggest. Both reports appear April 7 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Genetic evidence in the new reports indicates for the first time that distinct human populations reached Europe shortly after 50,000 years ago. Neandertals interbred with all the groups detected so far, ensuring that some of their genes live on today in our DNA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remains of three &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; individuals unearthed in Bulgaria’s Bacho Kiro Cave yielded &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03335-3&quot;&gt;nuclear DNA containing Neandertal contributions of about 3 to 4 percent&lt;/a&gt;, says a team led by evolutionary geneticist Mateja Hajdinjak of the Francis Crick Institute in London. The ancient DNA came from a tooth and two bone fragments radiocarbon dated to between around 43,000 and 46,000 years ago. Stone tools typical of late Stone Age humans were found in the same sediment as the fossils.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“All of the Bacho Kiro individuals had recent Neandertal ancestors, as few as five to seven generations back in their family trees,” Hajdinjak says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further evidence of ancient interbreeding comes from a nearly complete human skull discovered in 1950 in a cave in what’s now the Czech Republic. About &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41559-021-01443-x&quot;&gt;2 percent of the genes&lt;/a&gt; in DNA from that fossil, identified as a female’s, also come from Neandertals, say evolutionary geneticist Kay Prüfer of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, and his colleagues. Analysis of those DNA segments suggest she also lived around 45,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; fossils in Bulgaria and the Czech Republic aren’t the first ones found with bits of Neandertal DNA in their genomes, but they are most likely the oldest. The long Neandertal DNA segments in the eastern European woman, which would have broken into shorter segments in later human generations, suggest she lived a few hundred to a few thousand years earlier than a previously reported 45,000-year-old Siberian man who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-human-dna-narrows-time-neandertal-hookups&quot;&gt;shared 2.3 percent of his genes with Neandertals&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/22/14&lt;/em&gt;). That find indicated that interbreeding outside of Europe dated to as early as 60,000 years ago. And a Romanian man who lived roughly 40,000 years ago also possessed long stretches of Neandertal DNA, indicating he was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humans-and-neandertals-mated-more-recently-thought&quot;&gt;four to six generations removed from a Neandertal relative&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/11/15&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neandertals went extinct around 40,000 years ago, though their genetic remnants remain — today, non-African people carry, on average, nearly 2 percent Neandertal DNA. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-genetic-analysis-reveals-modern-africans-have-some-neandertal-dna&quot;&gt;Present-day Africans possess a smaller Neandertal genetic legacy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/30/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the new studies suggest that some early human entrants to Europe had a long-lasting impact on our DNA while others hit genetic dead-ends. Bacho Kiro humans represent a newly identified population of ancient Europeans with genetic ties to present-day East Asians and Native Americans, but not western Eurasians, Hajdinjak’s group says. Like the ancient Romanian and Siberian men, the Czech Republic woman contributed no genes to &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; that lived after around 40,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is remarkable that the Bacho Kiro finds could represent a population that was spreading 45,000 years ago at least from Bulgaria to China,” says evolutionary geneticist Carles Lalueza-Fox of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, who did not participate in either new investigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; and Neandertals regularly interbred as the latter population neared its demise, then relatively large numbers of incoming humans accumulated a surprising amount of DNA from smaller Neandertal populations, Lalueza-Fox suspects. After 40,000 years ago, additional migrations into Europe by people with little or no Neandertal ancestry would have further diluted Neandertal DNA from the human gene pool, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those humans made distinctive stone and bone tools and served as ancestors of present-day Europeans, Hajdinjak suggests. At Bacho Kiro Cave, for instance, newly recovered DNA from a roughly 35,000-year-old &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; bone fragment displays a different makeup than that of the cave’s earlier human inhabitants. This individual contributed genes mainly to later populations in Europe and western Asia, Hajdinjak says.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A mysterious magnetic property of subatomic particles called muons hints that new fundamental particles may be lurking undiscovered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a painstakingly precise experiment, muons’ gyrations within a magnetic field seem to defy predictions of the standard model of particle physics, which describes known fundamental particles and forces. The result strengthens earlier evidence that muons, the heavy kin of electrons, behave unexpectedly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a very big deal,” says theoretical physicist Bhupal Dev of Washington University in St. Louis. “This could be the long-awaited sign of new physics that we’ve all hoped for.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Muons’ misbehavior could point to the existence of new types of particles that alter muons’ magnetic properties. Muons behave like tiny magnets, each with a north and south pole. The strength of that magnet is tweaked by transient quantum particles that constantly flit into and out of existence, adjusting the muon’s magnetism by an amount known as the muon magnetic anomaly. Physicists can predict the value of the magnetic anomaly by considering the contributions of all known particles. If any fundamental particles are in hiding, their additional effects on the magnetic anomaly could give them away.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Muons and electrons share a family resemblance, but muons are about 200 times as massive. That makes muons more sensitive to the effects of hypothetical heavy particles. “The muon kind of hits the sweet spot,” says Aida El-Khadra of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To measure the magnetic subtleties of the muon, physicists flung billions of the particles around the huge, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-particle-physics-experiments-revamp-standard-model&quot;&gt;doughnut-shaped magnet&lt;/a&gt; of the Muon g−2 experiment at Fermilab in Batavia, Ill. (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/19/18&lt;/em&gt;). Inside that magnet, the orientation of the muons’ magnetic poles wobbled, or precessed. Notably, the rate of that precession &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.141801&quot;&gt;diverged slightly from the standard model expectation&lt;/a&gt;, physicists report April 7 in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://theory.fnal.gov/events/event/first-results-from-the-muon-g-2-experiment-at-fermilab/&quot;&gt;virtual seminar&lt;/a&gt;, and in a paper published in &lt;em&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a really complex experiment,” says Tsutomu Mibe of the KEK High Energy Accelerator Research Organization in Japan. “This is excellent work.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To avoid bias, the team worked under self-imposed secrecy, keeping the final number hidden from themselves as they analyzed the data. At the moment the answer was finally revealed, says physicist Meghna Bhattacharya of the University of Mississippi in Oxford, “I was having goose bumps.” The researchers found a muon magnetic anomaly of 0.00116592040, accurate to within 46 millionths of a percent. The theoretical prediction pegs the number at 0.00116591810. That discrepancy “hints toward new physics,” Bhattacharya says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A previous measurement of this type, from an experiment completed in 2001 at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y., &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-orbits-may-defy-main-physics-theory&quot;&gt;also seemed to disagree&lt;/a&gt; with theoretical predictions  (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/15/01&lt;/em&gt;). When the new result is combined with the earlier discrepancy, the measurement diverges from the prediction by a statistical measure of 4.2 sigma — tantalizingly close to the typical five-sigma benchmark for claiming a discovery. “We have to wait for more data from the Fermilab experiment to really be convinced that this is a real discovery, but it is becoming more and more interesting,” says theoretical physicist Carlos Wagner of the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Muon mystery&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new measurement (red) of the magnetic anomaly of the muon agrees with an earlier measurement (blue). The averaged measurements (purple) and the theoretical prediction (green) disagree by a statistical measure of 4.2 sigma, suggesting unknown physics effects are at play. A five-sigma disagreement is considered sufficient to claim a discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

Abi &lt;em&gt;et al/PRL&lt;/em&gt; 2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to quantum physics, muons are constantly emitting and absorbing particles in a frenzy that makes theoretical calculations of the magnetic anomaly extremely complex. An international team of more than 170 physicists, co-led by El-Khadra, finalized the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157320302556?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;theoretical prediction&lt;/a&gt; in December 2020 in &lt;em&gt;Physics Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many physicists believe that this theoretical prediction is solid, and unlikely to budge with further investigation. But some debate lingers. Using a computational technique called lattice QCD for a particularly thorny part of the calculation gives an estimate that falls &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03418-1&quot;&gt;closer to the experimentally measured value&lt;/a&gt;, physicist Zoltan Fodor and colleagues report April 7 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. If Fodor and colleagues’ calculation is correct, “it could change how we see the experiment,” says Fodor, of Pennsylvania State University, perhaps making it easier to explain the experimental results with the standard model. But he notes that his team’s prediction would need to be confirmed by other calculations before being taken as seriously as the “gold standard” prediction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As theoretical physicists continue to refine their predictions, experimental estimates will improve too: Muon g−2 (pronounced gee-minus-two) physicists have analyzed only a fraction of their data so far. And Mibe and colleagues are planning an experiment using a different technique at J-PARC, the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex in Tokai, to begin in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the discrepancy between experiment and prediction holds up, scientists will need to find an explanation that goes beyond the standard model. Physicists already believe that the standard model can’t explain everything that’s out there: The universe seems to be pervaded by invisible dark matter, for example, that standard model particles can’t account for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some physicists speculate that the explanation for the muon magnetic anomaly may be connected to known puzzles of particle physics. For example, a new particle might simultaneously explain dark matter and the Muon g−2 result. Or there may be a connection to unexpected features of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/collider-data-hint-unexpected-new-subatomic-particles&quot;&gt;certain particle decays&lt;/a&gt; observed in the LHCb experiment at the CERN particle physics lab near Geneva (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/20/17&lt;/em&gt;), recently strengthened by &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11769&quot;&gt;new results&lt;/a&gt; posted at arXiv.org on March 22.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Muon g−2 measurement will intensify such investigations, says Muon g−2 physicist Jason Crnkovic of the University of Mississippi. “This is an exciting result because it’s going to generate a lot of conversations.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Picture a bridge made of Legos. One side has three support pieces, the other two. How would you stabilize the bridge?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most people would add a piece so that there are three supports on each side, a new study suggests. But why not remove a piece so that each side has two supports instead? It turns out that getting people to subtract — whether a Lego block, ingredients in a recipe or words in an essay — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03380-y&quot;&gt;requires reminders and rewards&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report April 7 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This default to addition isn’t limited to assembling blocks, cooking and writing. Rather, thinking in pluses instead of minuses could well contribute to modern-day excesses such as cluttered homes, institutional red tape and even an overburdened planet, says behavioral scientist Benjamin Converse of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. “We’re missing an entire class of solutions.”   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He and his colleagues first observed the behavior when they asked 1,585 study participants to tackle eight puzzles and problems that could be solved by adding or removing some things. For example, one puzzle required shading or erasing squares on a grid to make a pattern symmetric. In another, individuals could add or subtract items on a travel itinerary for the optimal experience. Across all experiments, the vast majority of participants chose addition over subtraction. For instance, out of 94 participants who completed the grid task, 73 added squares, 18 subtracted squares and another three simply reworked the original number of squares.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The researchers hypothesized that most participants defaulted to adding because they failed to even think about subtraction. So, through a series of controlled experiments, the team nudged participants toward the minus sign.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one experiment, the team offered 197 people wandering around a crowded university quad a dollar to solve a puzzle. Participants viewed a Lego structure in which a figurine was standing atop a platform with a large pillar behind her. Atop that pillar, a single block in one corner supported a flat roof. Researchers asked the participants to stabilize the roof to avoid squashing the figurine. About half the participants were told: “Each piece you add costs 10 cents.” Even with that financial penalty, only 40 out of 98 participants thought to remove the destabilizing block and just rest the roof on top of the wide pillar. The researchers gave the remaining participants a more explicit message: “Each piece you add costs 10 cents but removing pieces is free.” That cue prompted 60 out of 99 participants to remove the block.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;lego block tower with roof&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098325&quot; height=&quot;545&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/040621_sg_subtraction_inline1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098325&quot;&gt;In an experiment, participants had to stabilize a Lego roof over a figurine, represented by the piece of paper. Most people added pieces even though each piece cost 10 cents. Only when researchers specified that subtracting pieces was free did more people remove the destabilizing block and rest the roof on top of the wide pillar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098325&quot;&gt;Adams &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; 2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Practice did help participants call to mind that elusive minus sign, the researchers found. A variation on the grid experiment, where subtraction yielded the superior solution, showed that three practice runs leading up to the actual task prompted more participants to subtract than those who solved the task without practice.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When people try to make something better … they don’t think that they can remove or subtract unless they are somehow prompted to do so,” says behavioral scientist Gabrielle Adams, also at the University of Virginia.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Conversely, bombarding participants &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-stress-brain&quot;&gt;with unrelated information&lt;/a&gt; decreased their likelihood of subtracting (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/24/20&lt;/em&gt;). People add even more when they experience information overload, those experiments showed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On an intuitive level, people recognize that subtraction comes less naturally than addition, the authors say. Hence the adoption of adages, such as “less is more” and Marie Kondo’s now infamous mantra to get rid of those things that fail to spark joy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But curbing our love of excess will take more than nudges and a clear mind, says Hal Arkes, a judgement and decision-making researcher at Ohio State University who was not involved with the study. Organizational and political leaders, especially, abhor cutting the fat. “If you add more people and more dollars, you won’t make any enemies, you’ll just make friends,” Arkes says. “Subtraction has serious downsides.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/07/when-people-hold-morally-based-attitudes-two-sided-messages-can-encourage-them-to-consider-opposing-viewpoints/"/>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where do you stand on pheasant shooting? Or single-religion schools? Or abortion? However you feel, your attitudes probably have a strong moral basis. This makes them especially resistant to change. And since anyone who holds an opposing view, based on their own moral stance, is unlikely to be easily swayed by your arguments, these kinds of disputes tend to lead to blow-outs within families and workplaces, as well, of course, as online.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, anything that can encourage people to be more open to at least thinking about an alternative point of view could be helpful, reasoned Mengran Xu and Richard E. Petty at The Ohio State University, US. And in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167220988371&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, they reveal a potentially promising method for doing just this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41750&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first pair of studies, the researchers looked at how various messages about gun control and freedom of speech for Nazis went down with a total of 375 US-based participants. The participants first reported on their attitudes to these topics, and the extent to which those attitudes had a moral basis. Then, those who felt that Nazis should &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;be allowed to speak in US high schools read a statement that concluded with the argument that, in fact, they should be allowed to. There were two variations, however: this conclusion was preceded either with strong arguments in its favour (a one-sided message), or with these arguments plus an acknowledgement that some people might find this “too much” for high school students (a two-sided message). A similar procedure was used with those who’d initially reported support for gun control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, the participants used a simple scale to indicate how open they were to reconsidering their position. The researchers’ analysis revealed that as the moral basis of a participant’s attitudes increased, their openness to the opposing view decreased. However, for those who’d read the two-sided message, this effect disappeared: that is, morally-based attitudes no longer seemed to make people less open to opposing views.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A follow-up study found that when a two-sided argument did not really respect the opposing argument, in that it offered only weak counter-arguments — such as claiming that gun ownership is bad because guns make upsetting loud noises — this was no more effective at influencing the participants than single-sided messages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A final study attempted to get closer to examining people’s actual behaviour. The participants in this study had all reported being unsupportive of the idea that masks should always be worn outside during the Covid-19 pandemic. The team found that a two-sided message had a bigger impact than a one-sided message on the participants’ reported openness towards more mask-wearing, and on their reported intention to wear masks more often.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With respect to the findings overall, the researchers write, “the relative benefit of a two-sided message over a one-sided communication is enhanced as the attitude’s moral basis increases.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Conflict and misunderstanding between people with different views does seem to have grown worse in recent decades, they add. This work suggests that one way to tackle this — and to advance your or your organisation’s point of view on a topic with a strong moral underpinning — is to clearly respect the reasons for an alternative viewpoint at the same time as advocating your own position. This is hardly a radical argument. But given the often vitriolic debates that develop around morally based attitudes, it’s surely worth bearing in mind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167220988371&quot;&gt;Two-Sided Messages Promote Openness for Morally Based Attitudes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hardyhead-silverside-fish-crystals-colorful-dots"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;As light shines steadily on a silver slip of a fish, minuscule dots on the fish start flashing: blue, yellow, blue, yellow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bodies “do not glow like luminous fish,” Masakazu Iwasaka, an interdisciplinary engineer at Hiroshima University in Japan has discovered. Instead of making their own light, it turns out that remarkable little photonic crystals in &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.201578&quot;&gt;fish spots reflect certain wavelengths of light&lt;/a&gt;, alternating between blues and more greenish-yellows, he reports April 7 in &lt;em&gt;Royal Society Open Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lots of biological materials have evolved tricks manipulating light. The iconic morpho blue butterfly doesn’t have a flake of blue pigment. It creates its dream-perfect sky blue with stacks of microscopic light-manipulating plates. So do &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/blue-leaves-help-begonias-harvest-energy-low-light&quot;&gt;blue-leaved begonias&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/28/16&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those fish reflectors are doing something similar in wide-banded hardyhead silversides &lt;em&gt;(Atherinomorus lacunosus&lt;/em&gt;). “I found the flashing of a small spot by chance” while screening the dots no bigger than 7 to 10 micrometers across on fish backs, he says. Inside the reflective flash spots lie little platelets of the compound guanine that have grown in such a way that they can reflect colorful light depending on the angle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;When a steady light shines on the back of wide-banded hardyhead silversides (&lt;em&gt;Atherinomorus lacunosus&lt;/em&gt;), little spots pulse from blue to greenish-yellow. It’s all a trick of reflecting light, a new study finds.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Guanine may sound familiar. It’s one of the four major coding units that pair up in storing DNA’s genetic information. What gives the fish guanine platelets particular abilities though remains a puzzle. Iwasaka suspects that inside a spot, platelets move in ways that change their apparent color and dazzle power. The blue-yellow light pulses only in living silversides. Dead fish just reflect white-white.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Iwasaka hopes to create human-made counterparts to the fish reflectors. He proposes mimicking fishy structures for sensors far, far smaller than the period on a magazine page. Versions of little sparkling fish lights could fit into the world of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) to monitor conditions inside living tissues, responding to light or flashing themselves. In earlier work, he’s shown how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34866-x&quot;&gt;guanine platelets can be manipulated in magnetic fields&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that such sensors could be targeted and herded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What the fish uses its lightshow for remains a mystery. Flashing spots aren’t unique to wide-banded hardyhead silversides, Iwasaka points out. At least two other papers reported flashing (blue to red) in other tropical fishes, probably for communication. Maybe silverside flashing communicates something too, Iwasaka says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or there could be safety benefits. Fish ecologist David Conover of the University of Oregon in Eugene has worked with a silvery &lt;em&gt;Menidia&lt;/em&gt; species in the same fish family as the species Iwasaka studies. “For fish that live in bright light and near the surface, as do silversides, the reflectivity probably serves as a type of camouflage or distraction from predators lurking or striking from below,” Conover says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whatever drives the evolution of iridophores, those reflective spots where Iwasaka found inspiration, they’re common in the fish world. There could be plenty more places to look for flashes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Watch a group of lions yawn, and it may seem like nothing more than big, lazy cats acting sleepy, but new research suggests that these yawns may be subtly communicating some important social cues. Yawning is not only contagious among lions, but it appears to help the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2021.02.010&quot;&gt;predators synchronize their movements&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report March 16 in &lt;em&gt;Animal Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery was partially made by chance, says Elisabetta Palagi, an ethologist at the University of Pisa in Italy. While studying play behavior in spotted hyenas in South Africa, she and colleagues often had the opportunity to watch lions (&lt;em&gt;Panthera leo&lt;/em&gt;) at the same time. And she quickly noticed that lions yawn quite frequently, concentrating these yawns in short time periods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yawning is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/minutes-after-encountering-danger-lemurs-yawn&quot;&gt;ubiquitous among vertebrates&lt;/a&gt;, possibly boosting blood flow to the skull, cooling the brain and aiding alertness, especially when transitioning in and out of rest (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/8/15&lt;/em&gt;). Fish and reptiles will yawn, but more social vertebrates such as birds and mammals appear to have co-opted the behavior for purposes conducive to group living. In many species — like humans, monkeys, and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/parakeets-can-catch-yawns-their-neighbors&quot;&gt;parakeets&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/1/15&lt;/em&gt;) — yawners can infect onlookers with their “yawn contagion,” leading onlookers to yawn shortly afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seeing the lions yawn reminded Palagi of her own work on contagious yawning in primates. Curious if the lions’ prodigious yawning was socially linked, Palagi and her team started recording videos of the big cats, analyzing when they were yawning and any behaviors around those times. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Over four months in 2019, the researchers closely monitored 19 lions at the Greater Makalali Private Game Reserve, just west of Kruger National Park. The team found that lions that saw another member of the pride yawn were about 139 times as likely to yawn themselves within the next three minutes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the yawn contagion didn’t stop there. Lions that caught a yawn from another lion were 11 times as likely to mirror the movements of the original yawner than those that hadn’t. This “motor synchrony” involved one lion yawning, then another yawning, then the first getting up and walking around or laying back down and the other doing the same thing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In lions, contagious yawning might be important for maintaining social cohesion, Palagi says. Yawns that help lions harmonize their group movements could help get the pride all on the same page, crucial behavior for an animal that hunts and rears offspring cooperatively. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If yawn contagion has evolved to foster the creation of bonds,” says Palagi, “after a yawn contagion event, the two animals need to do something together [like getting up and walking] to increase their probability of interacting.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other researchers have hypothesized that yawning could help coordinate group behavior in some species, notes Andrew Gallup, a biopsychologist at State University of New York Polytechnic Institute in Utica. “But this is the first study that I’m aware of that’s actually attempted to quantify that,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The spreading of [yawning] across the group via contagion could serve to enhance overall collective vigilance,” says Gallup. “I think as time continues, we’ll find that the contagious yawning is more common among some of these highly social species.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Palagi notes that yawning often marks a shift between different physiological or emotional states. So, a yawn could be a good way for an individual in a social species to communicate to group mates that it is experiencing some kind of internal change. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Yawning is a widespread behavior, but I think it’s one of the most mysterious,” Palagi says, since it appears to have different functions from species to species. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781982116217&quot;&gt;Pipe Dreams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chelsea Wald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avid Reader Press, $27&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone poops. But not everyone has a safe, sanitary place to do it. What’s more, existing wastewater treatments consume tons of water and energy while flushing away materials that could make fertilizers, fuels and other products.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We can do better,” science journalist Chelsea Wald writes in &lt;em&gt;Pipe Dreams&lt;/em&gt;, which recounts how scientists, entrepreneurs and activists are coming up with creative ways to make bathrooms more available and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;About 2 billion people lack access to adequate toilets. &lt;em&gt;Pipe Dreams &lt;/em&gt;spotlights organizations that seek to change that. One such nonprofit is Sustainable Organic Integrated Livelihoods, or SOIL, which serves neighborhoods that lack sewers in Cap-Haïtien, Haiti. Residents there traditionally have relied on pit latrines, which can poison well water. But SOIL users get home toilets outfitted with removable plastic pails, which SOIL employees collect regularly to dump in a nearby composting site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pipe Dreams &lt;/em&gt;really lives up to its title when Wald plunges into all the strange, unexpected ways that excrement can be used beyond compost. She describes a company in South Africa that feeds human waste to maggots; these critters then can be fed to animals or crushed to make oil. In Kenya, she finds an organization that makes briquettes from poop — in stoves, these burn cleaner and last longer than charcoal. Pure urine can make fertilizer, but Wald notes that when mixed with sand and bacteria, it can also make bricks. Inventions like the Lapee female urinal, a pink cubicle in which the user squats over an oval-shaped receptacle to relieve herself, can help gather this pure pee. But peeing in one is a weird enough experience that, as one woman who used one at an outdoor festival said, “You need to be a little bit drunk to do it,” Wald quotes.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Wald may not have sat on this particular pink throne, but she’s had enough experience with newfangled toilet technology to earn the nickname “Queen of Loo-topia” among her peers. Readers couldn’t ask for a more qualified guide to take them on a world tour of next-gen sewage schemes. In the book, Wald visits a facility in Africa that cleans portable toilets, enriches her home garden with Swiss-made urine-based fertilizer and sits on pee-diversion toilets in the Netherlands — which go beyond Lapee to harvest both pee and poop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After years of (metaphorically) immersing herself in excrement, Wald is immune to squeamishness. Her narration is frank and funny, and her sewage savvy allows her to weave in fascinating scientific and historic details, from the health benefits of squatting versus sitting to rumors that Joseph Stalin used a special toilet to steal the excretions of world leaders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pipe Dreams&lt;/em&gt; leaves readers knowing everything they ever wanted to know (and probably more) about toilets, perhaps inspiring them to start giving way more of a crap about crap. That’s a good thing: As Wald demonstrates, issues around excrement involve social justice and environmental sustainability. “We shouldn’t settle for the toilets we’ve inherited,” Wald writes. After finishing &lt;em&gt;Pipe Dreams&lt;/em&gt;, a reader can’t help but agree and hope that, thanks to toilet visionaries around the world, we may someday achieve Loo-topia.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We already know that bullying can be one way of climbing the social ladder for teenagers. Research published in 2019, for instance, found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/21/the-most-popular-teens-gain-status-through-a-combination-of-aggression-and-kindness/&quot;&gt;teenagers who combine aggressive behaviour with prosociality see the most social success&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But who, exactly, are teenagers bullying? According to Robert Faris from the University of California, Davis and colleagues, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/712972&quot;&gt;writing in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Sociology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it might not be who you’d expect. Rather than bullying those more distant from them, the team finds, teens often pick on their own friends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41740&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data came from a longitudinal study of middle and high school students in grades 6, 7, and 8 (years 7, 8, and 9 in the UK). The team looked specifically at aggression, creating “networks” that reflected who had been aggressive towards whom at the schools. These were based on peer-nominations by the students, who had named up to five schoolmates who had “done something mean” to them in the past three months, as well as five &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; had been mean to. This didn’t include friendly teasing, focusing instead on acts of genuine aggression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants also indicated who their five closest friends were. As with aggression, a matrix was created to understand mutual and unrequited friendships, as well as linking friends of friends and measuring whether friendships were sustained or dissolved over the course of the study. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also looked at several adverse outcomes of being bullied — anxiety, depression, and lack of attachment to school, based on self-reports from the kids. The aggression matrix and friendship matrix were then cross-referenced in order to ascertain whether students were being victimised by friends, friends of friends, or by more distant schoolmates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that bullying was more likely to occur within friendships, and between friends of friends, compared to between kids with more distant social ties. This could partly be down to aggression between &lt;em&gt;former&lt;/em&gt; friends: aggression was three times more likely to arise within friendships that dissolved during the school year. But it might also indicate a “frenemy” relationship, wherein both friendship and aggression coincide — aggression was four times more likely to occur in friendships that sustained themselves through the study than in more distant relationships (though it’s important to note the difference in rates of aggression between former friends and “frenemies” is not significant). Unsurprisingly, the team also found evidence that being bullied is associated with significant increases in depression and anxiety and decreases in attachment to school.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What is clear from the results is that victimisation is a common experience for teenagers — and that it can be friends and friends of friends who perpetrate this aggression, whether those ties are mutual or not. While individual traits or social and familial circumstances are key to understanding why teens bully others, the results also suggest that the complex social dynamics of schools can play a significant part too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This may be a chance to rethink anti-bullying programmes, the team suggests: &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/21/the-most-popular-teens-gain-status-through-a-combination-of-aggression-and-kindness/&quot;&gt;as previous research has shown&lt;/a&gt;, aggression can have a positive social outcome for bullies, helping them climb the social ladder. Thinking more carefully about how to strengthen existing friendships and highlight their rewards may be one way of reducing the social value accrued through aggression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/712972&quot;&gt;With Friends Like These: Aggression from Amity and Equivalence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Climate change may be sparking more lightning in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data from a worldwide network of lightning sensors suggest that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020GL091366&quot;&gt;frequency of lightning strikes in the region has shot up&lt;/a&gt; over the last decade, researchers report online March 22 in &lt;em&gt;Geophysical Research Letters&lt;/em&gt;. That may be because the Arctic, historically too cold to fuel many thunderstorms, is heating up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-burning-greenland-melting-thanks-record-heat&quot;&gt;twice as fast&lt;/a&gt; as the rest of the world (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/2/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new analysis used observations from the World Wide Lightning Location Network, which has sensors across the globe that detect radio waves emitted by lightning bolts. Researchers tallied lightning strikes in the Arctic during the stormiest months of June, July and August from 2010 to 2020. The team counted everywhere above 65° N latitude, which cuts through the middle of Alaska, as the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The number of lightning strikes that the detection network precisely located in the Arctic spiked from about 35,000 in 2010 to about 240,000 in 2020. Part of that uptick in detections may have resulted from the sensor network expanding from about 40 stations to more than 60 stations over the decade.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;And just looking at the 2010 and 2020 values alone may overstate the increase in lightning, because “there’s such variability, year to year,” and 2020 was a particularly stormy year, says Robert Holzworth, an atmospheric and space scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. In estimating the increase in average annual lightning strikes, “I would argue that we have really good evidence that the number of strokes in the Arctic has increased by, say, 300 percent,” Holzworth says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That increase happened while global summertime temperatures rose from about 0.7 degrees Celsius above the 20th century average to about 0.9 degrees C above — hinting that global warming may create more favorable conditions for lightning in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It makes sense that a warmer climate could generate more lightning in historically colder climes, says Sander Veraverbeke, an earth systems scientist at VU University Amsterdam who was not involved in the work. If it does, that could potentially ignite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-arctic-browning&quot;&gt;more wildfires&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/11/19&lt;/em&gt;). But the apparent trend in Arctic lightning strikes should be taken with a grain of salt because it covers such a short period of time and the detection network includes few observing stations at high latitudes, Veraverbeke says. “We need more stations in the high north to really accurately monitor the lightning there.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Zap stats&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The frequency of summertime Arctic lightning strikes skyrocketed from 2010 to 2020 (blue bars), according to data collected by the World Wide Lightning Location Network, or WWLLN. Since that uptick may in part be due to the network adding more sensors, researchers calculated the number of lightning strikes they would have expected to see each year if the WWLLN used the same number of sensors over time (orange line). That analysis still showed a major increase in lightning strikes over the decade.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2021-04-05T13:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Depictions of extinct human ancestors and cousins are often more art than science.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, two reconstructions of the Taung child, a 2.8-million-year-old &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus africanus&lt;/em&gt; skull discovered in South Africa in 1924. One version, made using a sculptor’s intuition, appears more apelike. A second version, made while working alongside a scientist, appears more humanlike.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, the researchers that produced the dueling images are attempting to remove some of this subjectivity by introducing standards that may give more accurate and reproducible portraits of species known only from fossilized bone. The team points out some of the flaws in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.639048/full&quot;&gt;facial reconstructions of ancient hominids&lt;/a&gt; — and the social and ethical implications misleading portraits may have — in a report published February 26 in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;side by side computer illustrations of a face and head&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098100&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/032621_ti_hominid-reconstructions_inline1-790x450.jpg&quot; width=&quot;790&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098100&quot;&gt;These two reconstructions of the Taung child depend on subjective decisions to make it appear more apelike (left) or humanlike (right).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098100&quot;&gt;G. Vinas, R.M. Campbell, M. Henneberg and R. Diogo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Getting the depictions right matters, says Rui Diogo, a biological anthropologist at Howard University in Washington, D.C. When museumgoers see artists’ renditions of Neandertals or extinct hominids, visitors often don’t realize how much bias creeps into the work. “They think it is reality,” he says. And that can skew people’s views and reinforce existing prejudices of present-day people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://naturalhistory.si.edu/exhibits/david-h-koch-hall-human-origins&quot;&gt;reconstructions of multiple extinct hominids&lt;/a&gt; in the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., portray skin getting lighter and lighter in color as species became more and more bipedal. “But there is zero evidence to say the skin was whiter,” Diogo says. Such a depiction might give the mistaken impression that people with lighter skin are more evolved.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Artists’ depictions can also give erroneous views of human evolution and extinct species’ intelligence and behavior, says Diogo’s coauthor Ryan Campbell, an anatomical scientist and physical anthropologist at the University of Adelaide in Australia. For instance, Neandertals are often portrayed as having matted, dirty hair. “It’s as if there is a bias toward portraying our ancestors as if they were stupid and didn’t have hygiene,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But animals of all kinds groom themselves, and there is no reason to think that Neandertals or other extinct hominids were any different. In fact, presenting reconstructions without hair might be more accurate, says Campbell. Hair is usually not preserved in fossils and DNA data from bones may hint at hair color, but don’t reveal grooming habits. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image alignwide size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;three views of a scan of a skull&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098101&quot; height=&quot;369&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/032621_ti_hominid-reconstructions_inline2-800x369.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098101&quot;&gt;Accurate artistic depictions of extinct hominids begin with precise scans of skeletal findings, such as this digital scan of a cast made from the original Taung child skull fossil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098101&quot;&gt;G. Vinas, R.M. Campbell, M. Henneberg and R. Diogo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Reconstructing hair is not even informed speculation,” Campbell says. “It’s imaginary speculation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists and artists often work together to produce reconstructions, but the choices they make may be driven more by whim than science, the researchers contend. By studying muscles in the great apes and other nonhuman primates, Diogo and colleagues have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visibleapeproject.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;constructed reference databases&lt;/a&gt; that scientists might use in reconstructing faces from fossils. Even then, whether a sculptor chooses chimpanzee or human muscles as their starting point can produce very different outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The reconstructions of the past, most of them did not have a scientific basis,” Diogo says. “Our goal is to change the methods and to change the biases” to give a more accurate view of human evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;For the first time, physicists have used lasers to deep-freeze antimatter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a new experiment, an ultraviolet laser quelled the thermal jitters of antihydrogen atoms, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03289-6&quot;&gt;chilling the antiatoms to just above absolute zero&lt;/a&gt;. This technique for slowing down antimatter — the oppositely charged counterpart to normal matter — could help scientists build the first antimatter molecules. Taming unruly antimatter with laser light may also allow physicists to measure the properties of antiatoms much more precisely, researchers report in the April 1 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. Comparing antiatoms with normal atoms could test some fundamental symmetries of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lasers can cool atoms by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-plasma-ultra-cold-magnetic-field-trap&quot;&gt;dampening the atoms’ motion with a barrage of light particles&lt;/a&gt;, or photons (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/8/21&lt;/em&gt;). But it’s been hard to laser-cool antimatter because, for one thing, “it’s really difficult to make antimatter,” says Takamasa Momose, a spectroscopist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To craft antihydrogen atoms, Momose and colleagues mixed antiprotons with positrons, the antiparticles of electrons, at the CERN particle physics lab near Geneva. Over several hours, a laser beam tuned to a specific frequency of UV light slowed the antihydrogen atoms from whizzing around at up to 90 meters per second to about 10 meters per second.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Future observations of supercooled antihydrogen could test an idea called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antimatter-hydrogen-atoms-quantum-quirk-lamb-shift-normal-hydrogen&quot;&gt;charge-parity-time, or CPT, symmetry&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/19/20&lt;/em&gt;). This physics principle says that normal atoms should absorb and emit photons with the exact same energies as their antimatter look-alikes. Even the tiniest differences between hydrogen and antihydrogen could undermine modern theories of physics, says study coauthor Makoto Fujiwara, a particle physicist at the Canadian national particle accelerator center, TRIUMF, also in Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Einstein’s theory of gravity predicts that matter and antimatter should fall to Earth at the same rate. Lab experiments dropping laser-cooled antiatoms — instead of warm, jittery ones — into free fall could provide a clearer view of gravity’s effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<updated>2021-04-02T12:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Studying fabrics at very high magnification helps determine how some face masks filter out particles better than others. And the close-ups reveal an unseen beauty of the mundane objects that have now become an essential part of life around the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As scientists continue to show how effective masks can be at slowing the spread of the new coronavirus, particularly when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic&quot;&gt;they have a good fit and are worn correctly&lt;/a&gt;, some have taken microscopic approaches (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/12/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Embedded in microscale textures are clues as to why materials have various properties,” says Edward Vicenzi, a microanalysis expert at the Smithsonian’s Museum Conservation Institute in Suitland, Md. “Unraveling that evidence turns out to be a fun job.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before the pandemic, Vicenzi spent his days observing meteorites, stones and other museum specimens under the microscope. But in March 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, he and colleagues from the National Institute for Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md., felt a strong desire to contribute to beating back the virus. So they started studying face-covering materials instead.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N95 mask: &lt;/strong&gt;In an N95 mask (seen in false color cross-section), a thin outer layer (top) and thick inner layer (bottom) sandwich a filtration layer (purple), which traps the smallest particles. The multilayered assemblage made of plastic is melted and blown into a weblike fabric, which makes N95s filter particles better than cloth masks, even cotton ones.&lt;/span&gt;				&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;E.P. Vicenzi/Smithsonian’s Museum Conservation Institute and NIST&lt;/span&gt;			

			&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;	&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using a scanning electron microscope, Vicenzi and colleagues have examined dozens of materials, including coffee filters, pillowcases, surgical masks and N95 masks. In 2020, the team found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.0c05025&quot;&gt;N95 respirator masks are the most effective&lt;/a&gt; at providing protection from aerosols like the ones in which SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, travels. And the researchers reported that synthetic fabrics, like chiffon or rayon, don’t trap as many particles as tightly woven cotton flannels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microscopic textures can explain each fabric’s ability to filter out aerosols. The random nature of cotton fibers — with its wrinkled texture and complex shapes such as kinks, bends and folds — probably allows cotton to trap more nanoscale particles than other fabrics, Vicenzi says. In contrast, polyester fabrics have highly organized, mostly straight and smooth fibers, which makes them less efficient as face masks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cotton flannels also provide additional protection &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsanm.0c03319&quot;&gt;by absorbing moisture from breath&lt;/a&gt;, Vicenzi and colleagues report March 8 in &lt;em&gt;ACS Applied Nano Materials&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Since cotton loves water, it swells up in humid environments, and that makes it harder for particles to make their way through a mask,” says Vicenzi. Polyester and nylon masks, on the other hand, “repel water from your breath, so there’s no added benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through his work, Vicenzi has explored the unseen world of face-covering materials. Some textiles remind him of food, such as rayon’s fibers that resemble the texture of rigatoni pasta. Others, like wool, remind him of atmospheric patterns such as the swirl of a hurricane.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vicenzi plans to keep observing face masks up close. And he hopes his research helps people decide how to best protect themselves and others during the COVID-19 pandemic. “It’s nice to use an effective material for a mask if you can,” he says. “However, wearing any mask compared to none at all makes the biggest difference in slowing the spread of pathogens.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p class=&quot;has-normal-font-size&quot;&gt;A century ago, people needed help to understand science. Much as they do today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then as now, it wasn’t always easy to sort the accurate from the erroneous. Mainstream media, then as now, regarded science as secondary to other aspects of their mission. And when science made the news, it was often (then as now) garbled, naïve or dangerously misleading.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;E.W. Scripps, a prominent newspaper publisher, and William Emerson Ritter, a biologist, perceived a need. They envisioned a service that would provide reliable news about science to the world, dedicated to truth and clarity. For Scripps and Ritter, science journalism had a noble purpose: “To discover the truth about all sorts of things of human concern, and to report it truthfully and in language comprehensible to those whose welfare is involved.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so Science Service was born, 100 years ago — soon to give birth to the magazine now known as &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In its first year of existence, Science Service delivered its weekly dispatches to newspapers in the form of mimeographed packets. By 1922 those packets became available to the public by subscription, giving birth to &lt;em&gt;Science News-Letter&lt;/em&gt;, the progenitor of &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;. Then as now, the magazine’s readers feasted on a smorgasbord of delicious tidbits from a menu encompassing all flavors of science — from the atom to outer space, from agriculture to oceanography, from transportation to, of course, food and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In those early days, much of the new enterprise’s coverage focused on space, such as the possibility of planets beyond Neptune. Experts shared their views on whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/may-23-1921&quot;&gt;spiral-shaped clouds in deep space&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/august-26-1922&quot;&gt;far-off entire galaxies of stars&lt;/a&gt;, like the Milky Way, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/october-10-1921&quot;&gt;embryonic solar systems&lt;/a&gt; just now forming within the Milky Way. Articles explored the latest speculation about life on Venus (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/january-16-1922&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/june-19-1922&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/february-13-1922&quot;&gt;on Mars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regular coverage was also devoted to new technologies — particularly radio. One Science Service dispatch informed readers on how to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/february-27-1922&quot;&gt;make their own home radio set — for $6&lt;/a&gt;. And in 1922 &lt;em&gt;Science News-Letter&lt;/em&gt; reported on an astounding radio breakthrough: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/april-10-1922&quot;&gt;a set that could operate without a battery&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate our upcoming 100th anniversary, we’ve launched a series that highlights some of the biggest advances in science over the last century. Visit our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/century/about&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Century of Science&lt;/a&gt; site to see the series as it unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-button aligncenter is-style-fill&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;wp-block-button__link has-white-color has-text-color has-background&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/century/about&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #005587;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Much of the century’s scientific future was presaged in those early reports. In May 1921, an article on recent subatomic experiments noted the “dream of scientist and novelist alike that man would one day learn how … to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/may-16-1921&quot;&gt;utilize the vast stores of energy inside of atoms&lt;/a&gt;.” In 1922 Science Service editor Edwin Slosson speculated that the “smallest unit of positive electricity” (the proton) might “be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/september-2-1922&quot;&gt;a complex of many positive and negative particles&lt;/a&gt;,” a dim but prescient preview of the existence of quarks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;True, some prognostications did not age so well. A 1921 prediction that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/july-25-1921&quot;&gt;the United States would be forced to adopt the metric system&lt;/a&gt; for commercial transactions is still awaiting fulfillment. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/july-11-1921&quot;&gt;simple, common, international auxiliary language&lt;/a&gt; — “confidently predicted” in 1921 to become “a part of every educated person’s equipment” — remains unestablished today. And despite serious considerations of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/may-8-1922&quot;&gt;calendar reform by astronomers and church dignitaries&lt;/a&gt; reported in May 1922, well over 1,000 of the same old months have since passed without the slightest alteration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, “the favorite fruit of Americans of the generations to follow us will be the avocado,” as predicted in 1921, is possibly arguable, though there was no mention of toast — just the suggestion that “a few crackers and an avocado sprinkled with a little salt make a hearty and well-balanced lunch.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One happily false prognostication was the repeated forecast of the rise of eugenics as a “scientific” endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The organization of an artificial selection is only a question of time. It will be possible to renew as a whole, in a few centuries, all humanity, and to replace the mass by another much superior mass,” a “distinguished authority on anthropo-sociology” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/september-19-1921&quot;&gt;declared in a Science Service news item from 1921&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/june-20-1921&quot;&gt;Another eugenicist proclaimed&lt;/a&gt; that “Eugenic Science” should be applied to “shed the light of reason on the primeval instinct of reproduction,” so that “disgenic marriages” would be banned just as bigamy and incest are.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the century since, thanks to saner and more sophisticated knowledge of genetics (and more social enlightenment in general), eugenics has been disavowed by science and is now revived in spirit only by the ignorant or malevolent. And during that time, real science has progressed to an elevated degree of sophistication in many other ways, to an extent almost unimaginable to the scientists and journalists of the 1920s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-pullquote alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the past century’s groundbreaking experimental discoveries, revolutionary theoretical revelations and prescient speculations have not eliminated science’s familiarity with false starts, unfortunate missteps and shortsighted prejudices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Science Service (now Society for Science) launched its mission, astronomers were unaware of the extent of the universe. No biologist knew what DNA did, or how brain chemistry regulated behavior. Geologists saw that Earth’s continents looked like separated puzzle pieces, but declared that to be a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modern scientists know better. Scientists now understand a lot more about the details of the atom’s interior, the molecules of life, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/century/brains-future-neuroscience-memory-mind-network&quot;&gt;intricacies of the brain&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/century/earth-history-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes&quot;&gt;innards of the Earth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime&quot;&gt;expanse of the cosmos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet somehow scientists still pursue the same questions, if now on higher levels of theoretical abstraction rooted in deeper layers of empirical evidence. We know how the molecules of life work, but not always how they react to novel diseases. We know how the brain works, except for those afflicted by dementia or depression (or when consciousness is part of the question). We know a lot about how the Earth works, but not enough to always foresee how it will respond to what humans are doing to it. We think we know a lot about the universe, but we’re not sure if ours is the only one, and we can’t explain how gravity, the dominant force across the cosmos, can coexist with the forces governing atoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the past century’s groundbreaking experimental discoveries, revolutionary theoretical revelations and prescient speculations have not eliminated science’s familiarity with false starts, unfortunate missteps and shortsighted prejudices. Researchers today have expanded the scope of the reality they can explore, yet still stumble through the remaining uncharted jungles of nature’s facts and laws, seeking further clues to how the world works.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase an old philosophy joke, science is more like it is today than it ever has been. In other words, science remains as challenging as ever to human inquiry. And the need to communicate its progress, perceived by Scripps and Ritter a century ago, remains as essential now as then.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The day before a giant asteroid hit Earth 66 million years ago, a very different kind of rainforest thrived in what is now Colombia. Ferns unfurled and flowering shrubs bathed in the sunlight that streamed down through large gaps in the canopy between towering conifers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chicxulub-collision-earth-crust-hot-water-microbes-million-years&quot;&gt;bolide hit&lt;/a&gt; and everything changed (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/1/20&lt;/em&gt;). That impact not only set off a massive extinction event that wiped out more than 75 percent of life on Earth, but it also redefined Earth’s tropical rainforests, transforming them &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abf1969&quot;&gt;from sun-dappled, open-canopied forests into the dark, dense, lush, dripping forests&lt;/a&gt; of today’s Amazon, researchers report April 2 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed tens of thousands of fossils of pollen, spores and leaves, collected from 39 sites across Colombia, that were dated to between 70 million and 56 million years ago.  The team then assessed overall forest plant diversity, dominant species and insect-plant interactions, and tracked how these factors shifted. Plant diversity declined by 45 percent in the immediate aftermath of the asteroid strike, the researchers found, and it took 6 million years before the rich diversity of the tropical rainforest rebounded. Even then, the forests were never the same.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A single historical accident changed the ecological and evolutionary trajectory of tropical rainforests,” says Carlos Jaramillo, a paleopalynologist — someone who studies ancient pollen — at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama City. “The forests that we have today are really the by-product of what happened 66 million years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Just before the extinction event, tropical forests were a roughly 50-50 mix of angiosperms, or flowering trees and shrubs, and of other plant species such as conifers and ferns. “The competition for light was not that intense,” Jaramillo says. Afterward, ferns and conifers largely vanished, and angiosperms took over to make up about 90 percent of the plant species in the forest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reasons why aren’t wholly clear. The region’s climate at the end of the Cretaceous Period 66 million years ago was similar to how it is today: hot and humid. But other factors were likely at work. Huge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-necked-dinosaurs-sauropod-jurassic-herbivores&quot;&gt;plant-eating sauropods&lt;/a&gt;, the long-necked dinosaurs, would have helped maintain the open gaps, letting light in, Jaramillo says (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/17/20&lt;/em&gt;). Once the asteroid hit, those dinosaurs were out of the picture. Extinction of certain plant families due to the impact also may have played a role, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A third likely factor was a shift in the chemical composition of the forest soil. Frequent rainfall during the warm, wet Cretaceous leached the soils of many nutrients, which would have favored gymnosperms like conifers, says Jaramillo. “The gymnosperms had this amazing ability to grow with very little food, and could outcompete the angiosperms.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ashfall fluttering to the ground in the wake of the asteroid impact may have added phosphorus to the soils, effectively fertilizing them, the team suggests. With more food available, angiosperms readily outcompeted the gymnosperms, swiftly growing skyward and blocking out the sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This thick, closed canopy appeared soon after the impact, but overall forest diversity took much longer to recover, as new species began to evolve to occupy new ecological niches. This was also true of the many insect species that had once feasted on the plants, the researchers found. Leaf fossils bear traces of the different types of interactions between herbivorous insects and plants, from creatures that strip leaves to their skeletons to those that drill careful holes through them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;fossils of leaves and pollen&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098087&quot; height=&quot;1030&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/040121_cg_asteriod-rainforest_inline1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1030&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098087&quot;&gt;Fossils of leaves (shown) and pollen from across Colombia reveal how the tropical rainforests shifted due to the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous. Before the event, the forests were a sunny, open-canopied mix of conifers, ferns and flowering trees (examples in the bottom half of this image). After the event, the forests were dominated by flowering trees, and developed a thick, heavy, light-blocking canopy (examples in the top half of this image).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098087&quot;&gt;Carvalho &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; 2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Generalist” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaurs-out-way-mammals-had-chance-thrive&quot;&gt;insects&lt;/a&gt; and other plant-munching groups that can make do with many different types of plants for food “seemed to squeak through largely unaffected,” says coauthor Conrad Labandeira, a paleoecologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/25/17&lt;/em&gt;). “The specialist interactions that got really creamed were things like leaf miners and piercers and suckers,” which are more dependent on particular plant types, Labandeira says.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recovery path holds a valuable lesson for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/protecting-half-planet-climate-change-save-species&quot;&gt;the long-lasting impact of modern human activities&lt;/a&gt; such as deforestation, Jaramillo says (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/4/20&lt;/em&gt;). “Generating new diversity takes geological time,” he says. “It’s not just about planting trees.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the first comprehensive picture of what happened in tropical ecosystems right after the extinction event, says paleoecologist Elena Stiles of the University of Washington in Seattle, who was not connected with the study. Most previous work on the chunks of time immediately before and after the extinction event — the very end of the Cretaceous and the start of the Paleogene Period — comes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-fossils-north-dakota-dinosaur-killing-asteroid-impact&quot;&gt;from North America&lt;/a&gt;, or from much farther south, such as in Patagonia, Stiles says (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/2/19&lt;/em&gt;). “In the tropics, there is no place where we have the boundary [between periods] preserved, [and] we have the limitation of a very fragmentary fossil record.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also striking, Stiles says, is the possibility that this finding may help answer a longstanding question about South America’s astonishing biodiversity. “For a long time, people have wondered where all of this diversity comes from,” she says. Researchers have speculated, for example, that the continent’s climate or its long isolation from other continents may be responsible. “So it’s really interesting that this mass extinction event could have been one of the mechanisms that shaped it to be this unique region,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-origin-who-report-takeaways"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A new World Health Organization report investigating the origins of the coronavirus has raised more questions than answers for how — and where — the virus that exploded into a global pandemic emerged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The report, released March 30, tallies where the evidence currently points: The virus, called SARS-CoV-2, probably jumped to people from bats through another animal; it likely did not come from a lab. But officials can’t yet prove — or rule out — any scenario. And questions about just how much access to potential evidence an international team of experts had on their 28-day trip to Wuhan, China, in January and February has cast a shadow on the findings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On that trip, 17 experts with the WHO teamed up with 17 Chinese scientists to assess four potential scenarios for the origins of the coronavirus. The two leading scenarios, the team concluded, are transmission of the virus to people either directly from bats or, more likely, via an intermediate animal like a civet or raccoon dog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A third possibility is the virus got to people through contaminated frozen food products, which the team considers less likely but says merits further investigation. The last scenario — that the virus began spreading among people following a lab accident — is “extremely unlikely,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a joint statement on March 30, 14 countries including the United States expressed concern that the WHO team was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/joint-statement-on-the-who-convened-covid-19-origins-study/&quot;&gt;delayed and didn’t have access to original data and samples from people and animals&lt;/a&gt;. That reaction comes amid reports that the Chinese government had a hand in the mission, controlling the sites the team accessed during the visit and the report’s wording. “Scientific missions like these should be able to do their work under conditions that produce independent and objective recommendations and findings,” the countries wrote in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some explanations may be more probable than others, but for now all possibilities remain on the table, says WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The report raised questions that require further study, such as additional work to pinpoint the earliest cases of COVID-19, he noted in a March 30 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-remarks-at-the-member-state-briefing-on-the-report-of-the-international-team-studying-the-origins-of-sars-cov-2&quot;&gt;meeting with WHO member states&lt;/a&gt;. He also said that when it came to the hypothesis that the virus came from a lab accident, “I do not believe that this assessment was extensive enough. Further data and studies will be needed to reach more robust conclusions.”   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This report is a very important beginning, but it is not the end,” he added. “We have not yet found the source of the virus, and we must continue to follow the science and leave no stone unturned. Finding the origin of a virus takes time. … No single research trip can provide all the answers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now though, here are four big takeaways from the 120-page report:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;1. Markets are the most probable source of major transmission of the virus.&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The focus is back on markets that sell animals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 made its global debut amid a cluster of cases linked to the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan in late December 2019. Researchers tested hundreds of animals in and around the market for the coronavirus — including animals for sale such as rabbits, hedgehogs, salamanders and birds — but none tested positive. Neither did thousands of domestic or wild animals in and around Wuhan. Additionally, some early COVID-19 cases that experts identified later, after the coronavirus had begun to spread in other countries, were not linked to the market.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, the findings hinted that the market may have helped the virus spread among people because of large crowds but that the Huanan Seafood Market was not the original source.    &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other markets may have also played a role in the virus’ spread, the investigation found. The earliest known case of COVID-19 was in a person who began showing symptoms on December 8, 2019. That person was not associated with the Huanan market but had recently visited another market.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, of 174 people who were sick with COVID-19 in December, more than half had recently gone to a market, where they might have been exposed. An additional 26 percent were exposed to meat and fish or frozen food products.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The failure so far to find an animal that tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 highlights how difficult it is to identify particular species as a potential host, Peter Ben Embarek, lead investigator for the WHO mission and a food safety expert, said in a March 30 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pscp.tv/w/1jMJgpqwngbxL?t=567&quot;&gt;news conference&lt;/a&gt;. The hunt for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-pandemic-origins-bats-virus&quot;&gt;where viruses came from takes time&lt;/a&gt; — sometimes years (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/18/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future studies should expand the search for infected animals to wildlife farms that supplied products to the markets linked to COVID-19 cases. The people who work at the farms and those who handled the products should also be tested for antibodies to see if they once had coronavirus infections, the team suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;2. The coronavirus probably was not widely circulating before December 2019&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is not yet evidence that the virus was extensively spreading among people before the earliest documented case of COVID-19 in early December, the WHO team found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers combed through more than 76,000 clinical records from October to November 2019. Within those records, there were 92 possible cases of COVID-19. But 67 of those people did not have signs of an infection based on antibody tests done a year later. And all 92 were ultimately ruled out based on the clinical criteria for COVID-19. The records would not have included mild cases in people who never went to the hospital, however, so there are potential gaps in the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additional evidence of isolated cases in countries outside China at the end of 2019 had hinted that the virus may have spread in those places before COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan. But those reports have not yet been confirmed, the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The timing for when the virus began spreading in China is in line with a recent study that analyzed genetic data and ran simulations of the early days of the pandemic to &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/03/17/science.abf8003&quot;&gt;estimate when the virus may have emerged&lt;/a&gt;. The spillover from animals to humans may have happened between mid-October and mid-November 2019, Joel Wertheim and colleagues reported March 18 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the virus transmitted from animals to humans, cases in people with mild symptoms may have helped the virus fly under the radar until December when some people fell severely ill, says Wertheim, an evolutionary biologist and molecular epidemiologist at the University of California, San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the pandemic itself was far from inevitable, Wertheim says. In the simulations, more than two-thirds of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions from animals to humans went extinct, causing only a few infections in people before dying out. “Even a virus capable of causing a pandemic that brings the world to its knees wasn’t necessarily a foregone conclusion.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;3. The “lab-leak” hypothesis is unlikely, though hard to completely disprove&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on a visit to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and interviews with scientists who work there, the report concludes that the virus most likely did not get its start in a lab. Though some experts have called for a full audit of the institute’s labs, the WHO mission was not designed to conduct a forensic investigation, WHO’s Ben Embarek said in the March 30 news conference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the institute considered the lab-leak hypothesis at the beginning of the pandemic and searched the institute’s records but did not find any evidence that anyone there was working with a SARS-CoV-2–like virus, Ben Embarek said. What’s more, antibody tests didn’t turn up any employees with signs of ever having had a coronavirus infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lab leak “is possible, but there’s no evidence to support it,” says Massa Shoura, a biophysicist and genomics expert at Stanford University who was not involved with the report. Other coronaviruses that caused SARS and MERS made the jump to humans from animals, so it makes sense that it would be the most likely pathway for SARS-CoV-2 as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet accumulating the data to prove a negative may be extremely difficult. “I don’t think we’ll ever be able to provide enough evidence to convince people who are convinced that it escaped from a lab that it didn’t,” Wertheim says. “Even if you find a virus literally identical to SARS-CoV-2 [in animals] … they could still argue that that virus had previously been found and isolated and brought into a lab and it escaped just the way it was.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;4. Experts are far from knowing the coronavirus’s origins&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the report offers few clear-cut conclusions regarding the start of the pandemic. Instead, it provides context for the possibilities and helps hone in on the studies researchers should tackle next.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, more than a year has passed since the virus made its jump to humans. That time lapse may hinder the investigation if SARS-CoV-2 no longer circulating in its reservoir, the animals that originally harbored it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have to be prepared that we may never find the natural reservoir for this virus,” Wertheim says. But sometimes, all it takes is one good sample to give researchers important clues. Perhaps that’s a chance encounter with the right animal during a wildlife survey, or testing people from the right market.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stepping even further back, researchers need to better understand the diversity of coronaviruses in bats and other wildlife in southeastern Asia, Shoura says. That means compiling a “dictionary” of the viruses found there to help researchers track viral evolutionary history, something the WHO team also recommends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have only scratched the surface of these very complex studies that need to be conducted,” Ben Embarek said.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Fairy wrasses are swimming jewels, flitting and flouncing about coral reefs. The finger-length fishes’ brash, vibrant courtship displays are meant for mates and rivals, and a new study suggests that the slow waxing and waning of ice sheets and glaciers may be partly responsible for such a variety of performances. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new genetic analysis of more than three dozen fairy wrasse species details the roughly 12 million years of evolution that produced their vast assortment of shapes, colors and behaviors. And the timing of these transformations implies that the more than 60 species of fairy wrasses may owe their great diversity to &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syab012/6146943&quot;&gt;cyclic sea level changes over the last few millions of years&lt;/a&gt;, scientists report February 23 in &lt;em&gt;Systematic Biology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within the dizzying assembly of colorful reef fishes, fairy wrasses (&lt;em&gt;Cirrhilabrus&lt;/em&gt;) can’t help but stand out. They are the most species-rich genus in the second most species-rich fish family in the ocean, says Yi-Kai Tea, an ichthyologist at the University of Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That is quite a bit of biodiversity,” says Tea, who notes that new fairy wrasse species are identified every year. Despite this taxonomic footprint, Tea says, scientists knew “next to nothing” about the fairy wrasses’ evolutionary history or why there were so many species.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;To fill this knowledge gap, Tea and his colleagues turned to the fishes’ genetics, extracting DNA from 39 different fairy wrasse species. Many earlier genetic studies on ocean animals in the region focused on a handful of genes in single species, but Tea and his team used a method that isolated nearly 1,000 genes from many species at once. Comparing DNA across species, the researchers reconstructed an evolutionary tree, showing how the dozens of fairy wrasse species are interrelated. The team also estimated how long ago these species split from one another. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fairy wrasses diverged from other wrasses about 12 million years ago in the Miocene Epoch, the researchers found. But many of the fairy wrasse species emerged only about 1 million to 3 million years ago, in the Pleistocene and late Pliocene Epochs. Fairy wrasses appear to have first evolved in the Coral Triangle, a region of exceptionally high coral reef biodiversity in the western Pacific Ocean. From there, the fishes exploded into many gaudy forms, spreading as far as the coast of East Africa to French Polynesia, a geographical range of some 17,000 kilometers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tea and his colleagues think the timing of this rapid evolution is tied directly to the geologic history of the region. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Indo-Australian Archipelago sits at the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Ocean basins — today, a spattering of islands strung between Asia and Australia. Tea describes this boundary as a “soft barrier,” with the spaces between islands occasionally allowing seafaring species to pass through to the neighboring ocean realm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But during the Pliocene and Pleistocene Epochs — when many fairy wrasses diversified — ice ages dramatically changed this seascape. When water became locked up in expansions of ice sheets and glaciers, sea level fell, turning shallow reefs into land bridges. Such changes may have allowed human ancestors &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-erectus-came-indonesia-300000-years-later-than-once-thought&quot;&gt;to access Indonesia and Australia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/9/20&lt;/em&gt;), but they also cut off the movement of marine life. This isolation encouraged the evolution of new species on either side of the barrier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;fairy wrasse fish with lavender stripe&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3097787&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/031921_JB_fairy-wrasse_inline.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3097787&quot;&gt;A male lavender-striped fairy wrasse (&lt;em&gt;Cirrhilabrus lineatus&lt;/em&gt;) flashes its fins in an elaborate courtship display.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3097787&quot;&gt;Yi-Kai Tea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the glaciers melted again, the waters rose, and the fishes could once again intermix. The rising and falling seas could act like a “species pump,” Tea explains, creating new fairy wrasse species and churning them out into the world every time the barrier dissolved. The team estimates that fairy wrasses infiltrated the Indian Ocean at least five different times this way. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings fit into an emerging picture of the region as an engine of biodiversity in tropical seas. Genetic differences between Indian and Pacific Ocean populations have been documented in everything from sea stars to giant clams, notes Paul Barber, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Los Angeles not involved with this research. Such divergences are signs of temporary isolation on either side of the Indo-Australian Archipelago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Glacial cycles “get missed sometimes in explanations of the diversification of fishes, particularly in the tropics,” says Lauren Sallan, a paleobiologist at the University of Pennsylvania also not involved with this research. “That aspect just isn’t brought up enough.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fairy wrasses’ elaborate mating rituals might also be why there are so many different species, Tea says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the wrasses live in large, mixed-species schools, the males are under extra pressure to not only attract a mate, but to make sure she’s of the correct species. A performance with a recognizable arrangement of colors — and in some cases, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reef-fish-get-riled-when-intruders-glow-red&quot;&gt;fluorescence&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/29/14&lt;/em&gt;) — would come in handy. Going that extra mile to find the right species might make crossbreeding less likely, but also encourages reproductive isolation. Over time, small genetic changes accumulate in each isolated group, so that the two wrasses become fundamentally different species, dissimilar in their DNA, appearance and behavior. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These patterns of fluorescence and colors are very species specific,” says Tea, who explains that there’s “heaps” left to explore about fairy wrasses, especially when it comes to how they choose mates and the evolution of their colors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You can dedicate your entire career to this if you wanted to and probably still never learn everything there is to learn with these amazing fishes.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re all familiar with the phrase “healthy body, healthy mind”. But this doesn’t just refer to physical fitness and muscle strength: for a healthy mind, we need healthy senses, too. Fortunately, there’s now a wealth of evidence that we can train our many senses, to improve not only how we use our bodies, but how we think and behave, as well as how we feel. Trapped as we are in our own “perceptual bubbles”, it can be hard to appreciate not only that other people sense things differently — but that so can we, if we only put in a little effort.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if we’re going to make the most of using and improving our senses to enhance our wellbeing, we have to consider more than sight, hearing, taste, touch and smell. Aristotle’s desperately outdated five sense model may still be popular, but it vastly under-estimates our extraordinary human capacity for sensing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41716&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proprioception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Proprioception — the sensing of the location of our body parts in space  —  has been relatively ignored, but it’s critical for confidence in using our bodies. If you now shut your eyes, and extend a leg, it’s thanks to this sense that you know exactly where your leg is. To go for a run, then, or work out in the gym, and not fall or injure yourself, you need a good sense of proprioception. Our sedentary lifestyles are a threat to this sense (and the Covid-19 lockdowns certainly did not help). But climbing trees, walking along balance beams, navigating obstacles, crossing stepping stones (which you can simulate at home, using small mats placed on the floor) are all proprioceptively demanding, and so train this sense. According to research led by a team at the University at North Florida, these kinds of exercises not only improve physical coordination &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26029969/&quot;&gt;but also working memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yoko Ichino, the ballet mistress at Northern Ballet, based in Leeds, teaches regular proprioception classes, during which students are required to practise complex moves with their eyes shut. “We use our eyes too much,” Ichino says. “We need to use all our other senses as well but because our eyes are open all the time, we never develop them. So I put that into my own training.” She recommends (if it is safe) to move around your home with your eyes closed. This will train not only proprioception but another suite of senses:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vestibular senses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our vestibular system allows us to sense the direction of gravity (and so which way is up), as well as horizontal and vertical movement (as in a car or a lift) and in three dimensions (as on a rollercoaster). Research shows that a healthy vestibular system is important not only for balance but for our sense of being grounded inside a physical body; in fact, people with vestibular problems are &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28669509/&quot;&gt;more likely to report out-of-body experiences&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also more likely to get lost, because a healthy vestibular system is important for a good sense of direction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For all of us, though, the older we get, the duller all our vestibular responses become. (This becomes noticeable at a population level &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5046616/&quot;&gt;from the not very grand old age of 40&lt;/a&gt;). Specific vestibular rehab training exercises have been developed for people diagnosed with definite vestibular problems. But the rest of us will benefit from dynamic movements that require moving the head, like those involved in climbing a tree or &lt;a href=&quot;https://vestibular.org/sites/default/files/page_files/Improving%20Balance%20With%20Tai%20Chi_2.pdf&quot;&gt;practising tai chi&lt;/a&gt;, as well as anything that challenges our balance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light-detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We know that our eyes are not just for seeing. When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2848671/&quot;&gt;melanopsin-expressing cells in the retina&lt;/a&gt; are exposed to light, they send signals to the master body-clock, in the brain’s hypothalamus (without causing us to see a thing). Certain variations in the gene for this protein have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2647333/&quot;&gt;linked to an increased risk of Seasonal Affective Disorder&lt;/a&gt;, and stimulating these receptors in the morning with suitable levels of light &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5299389/&quot;&gt;helps to ward off low mood.&lt;/a&gt; To improve psychological wellbeing, you don’t need to train these receptors to work better, but you do need to help them to work for you by getting outdoors in the morning and avoiding bright light in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Smell is not hugely regarded, or developed, in many people in Western cultures. But research with hunter-gatherer groups, such as the Jahai, who live in the tropical rainforest in Malaysia, shows that we have the biological capacity to smell extraordinarily well. Asifa Majid, now at the University of York, and colleagues, found, for example, that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2017.0139&quot;&gt;Jahai took on average only two seconds to precisely describe an odour, while Dutch-speakers took an average of 13 seconds&lt;/a&gt; to arrive at a much poorer description (describing the scent of a lemon simply as “lemony”, say, rather than using more abstract descriptions).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To develop your sense of smell, Majid and others advocate consciously smelling different things, often. Professional perfumer Nadjib Achaibou, who is based in London, tells me that his sensitive nose is absolutely trained, not born. The best way to enhance your sense of smell is to &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; it, and explore it, he argues: “You might say, ‘Oh, I like pepper.’ &lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt;? Why do I like it? What is it adding to your dish? That’s the first step to enhance your sense of smell. If you see a rose, stop and smell it. If you have a friend wearing perfume, smell the perfume and describe it. When you buy a shower gel, a toilet detergent or a perfume, ask questions. Read the marketing materials, but also trust yourself. You might think, yes they say there is rose in that but what I can smell is lemon. But what &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of lemon?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Put in the effort to enhance your sense of smell, and you should enjoy all kinds of other benefits. Research shows that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103115000281&quot;&gt;a fishy smell improves our critical thinking&lt;/a&gt;, for example, while a 2018 study in Germany found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/30/people-with-a-keener-sense-of-smell-find-sex-more-pleasant-and-if-they-are-female-have-more-orgasms-during-sex/&quot;&gt;people who are more sensitive to smells enjoyed sex more&lt;/a&gt;, and women with a better sense of smell reported more orgasms. “The perception of body odours such as vaginal fluids, sperm and sweat seems to enrich the sexual experience,” by increasing sexual arousal, they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have receptors in our skin that register temperatures within specific ranges. Stimulation of our “warmth-sensors”, in particular, has been linked to feeling less lonely, and also “warmer” towards other people. Some of the most-publicised results in this field have &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/01/02/now-john-barghs-famous-hot-coffee-study-has-failed-to-replicate/&quot;&gt;failed to replicate&lt;/a&gt;, leading critics to question them. However, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-79280-001&quot;&gt;2019 study &lt;/a&gt;in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; suggested that results might have been mixed because researchers weren’t taking into account the ambient temperature outside, or inside the lab. &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/27/cold-days-can-make-us-long-for-social-contact-but-warming-up-our-bodies-eliminates-this-desire/&quot;&gt;When they did this in their research&lt;/a&gt; — which involved strapping heated backwraps to participants and asking them about their social plans — the team found support for the idea that feeling cold physically is associated with feeling “colder” socially, driving a desire for more contact with other people. Providing heat (via the backwrap, in this case) could eliminate this effect. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inner sensing (interoception)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About 10% of us are really good at sensing our own heartbeat without feeling for a pulse, 5-10% of us are terrible at it, and the rest fall in between. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X17300106&quot;&gt;Research shows &lt;/a&gt;that people who are better at so-called “cardiac interoception” experience emotions more intensely, enjoy more nuanced emotions, and are better at recognising other people’s emotions, which is a critical first step in empathy. In contrast, people who don’t experience emotions in the typical way (a condition called “alexithymia”, which is thought to affect up to 10% of people, to some extent) &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsos.150664&quot;&gt;suffer from impairments in inner sensing&lt;/a&gt;. Could training inner sensing help, then, to improve our emotional wellbeing? It’s still early days for this research, but work led by Sarah Garfinkel, now at University College London, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079488/&quot;&gt;suggests that it can&lt;/a&gt;. This is a training technique that you could try at home:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit somewhere quiet and set a timer (on your phone or home digital assistant, perhaps) for one minute, but don’t start it yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now start the timer, and try to count your heart beats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do this again, but feel for your pulse this time, to take an accurate measure (this is the feedback that should help your interoceptive awareness to improve).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat all the steps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you can’t sense your heart beating, try exercising first, because this makes it easier.&lt;/p&gt;

Equations for regret, disappointment, elation, and satisfaction have been incorporated into economic models of financial decision-making (e.g., variants of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prospect theory&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial choices comprise one critical aspect of decision-making in our daily lives.

Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm out of my element here, so this will limit my understanding of these models. Which brings me to a more familiar topic: meta-commentary on interpretation (and extrapolation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Computational Decision-Making&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;I'm thinking  about writing a blog post entitled, &quot;Overinterpreting Computational  Models of Decision-Making&quot;. And by &quot;overinterpreting&quot; I mean claiming  results from a binary probabilistic decision-making task have  implications for individualized cognitive behavioral therapies.&lt;/p&gt;— sarcastic_f (@sarcastic_f) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarcastic_f/status/1371242065837748227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My motivation for writing this post was annoyance. And despair. A study on probabilistic decision-making under uncertain and volatile conditions came to the conclusion that people with anxiety and depression will benefit from focusing on past successes, instead of failures. Which kinda goes without saying. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/61387&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paper in &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was far more measured and sophisticated, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/12/22/in-shaky-times-focus-on-past-successes-if-overly-anxious-depressed/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The more chaotic things get, the harder it is for people with clinical anxiety and/or depression to make sound decisions and to learn from their mistakes. On a positive note, overly anxious and depressed people’s judgment can improve if they focus on what they get right, instead of what they get wrong...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...researchers tested the probabilistic decision-making skills of more than 300 adults, including people with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. In probabilistic decision making, people, &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;often without being aware of it&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, use the positive or negative results of their previous actions to inform their current decisions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unaware shall become aware. &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/12/22/in-shaky-times-focus-on-past-successes-if-overly-anxious-depressed/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Further advice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“When everything keeps changing rapidly, and you get a bad outcome from a decision you make, you might fixate on what you did wrong, which is often the case with clinically anxious or depressed people...” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...individualized treatments, such as cognitive behavior therapy, could improve both decision-making skills and confidence by focusing on past successes, instead of failures...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final statement on individualized CBT could very well be true, but it has nothing to do with the outcome of the study (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/61387&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gagne et al., 2021&lt;/a&gt;), wherein participants chose between two shapes associated with differential probabilities of receiving electric shock (Exp. 1), or financial gain or loss (Exp. 2).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VZS_oP9_w44/YGUu7EowltI/AAAAAAAANSU/Nt4ey7X5uVogq4qiv19AGPYvzFygKvMggCLcBGAsYHQ/s856/decision-making%2Bunder%2Bvolatility.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;381&quot; data-original-width=&quot;856&quot; height=&quot;178&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VZS_oP9_w44/YGUu7EowltI/AAAAAAAANSU/Nt4ey7X5uVogq4qiv19AGPYvzFygKvMggCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h178/decision-making%2Bunder%2Bvolatility.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;With that out of the way, I will say the experiments and the computational modeling approach are impressive. The theme is probabilistic decision-making under uncertainty, with the added bonus of volatility in the underlying causal structure (e.g., the square is suddenly associated a higher probability of shocks). People with anxiety disorders and depression are generally intolerant of  uncertainty. Learning the stimulus-outcome contingencies and then  rapidly adapting to change was predictably impaired. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does this general finding differ for learning under reward vs. punishment? For anxiety vs. depression? In the past, depression was associated with altered learning under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17586866&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reward&lt;/a&gt;, while  anxiety was associated with altered learning under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15885654&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;punishment&lt;/a&gt; (including in the authors' &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25730669&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;own work&lt;/a&gt;). For reasons that were not entirely clear to me, the authors chose to classify symptoms using a bifactor model designed to capture “internalizing psychopathology” common to both anxiety and depression vs. symptoms that are unique to each disorder [ &lt;i&gt;but see&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1047840X.2020.1853461&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fried (2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) ]&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800180;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, high scores on the common internalizing factor were associated with impaired adjustments to learning rate during the volatile condition, and this held whether the outcomes were shocks, financial gains, or financial losses. Meanwhile, high scores on anxiety-unique or depression-unique symptoms did not show this relationship. This was determined by computational modeling of task performance, using a hierarchical Bayesian framework to identify the model that best described the participants' behavior:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We fitted participants’ choice behavior using alternate versions of simple reinforcement learning models. We focused on models that were parameterized in a sufficiently flexible manner to capture differences in behavior between experimental conditions (block type: volatile versus stable; task version: reward gain versus aversive) and differences in learning from better or worse than expected outcomes. We used a hierarchical Bayesian approach to estimate distributions over model parameters at an individual- and population-level with the latter capturing variation as a function of general, anxiety-specific, and depression-specific internalizing symptoms. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've been living in a very uncertain world for more than a year now, often in a state of loneliness and isolation. Some of us have experienced loss after loss, deteriorating mental health, lack of motivation, lack of purpose, and difficulty making decisions. My snappish response to the press release concerns whether we can prescribe individualized therapies based on the differences between the yellow arrows on the left (“resilient people”) compared to the right (“internalizing people” — i.e., the anxious and depressed), given that the participants may not even realize they're learning anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-87TJ1MSMXCM/YGVHQRC0-MI/AAAAAAAANSc/h74SjsZGZzgce73aSxA4SoFNjc-o0-VGgCLcBGAsYHQ/s709/good%2Boutcome%2Bvolatile.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;709&quot; data-original-width=&quot;697&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-87TJ1MSMXCM/YGVHQRC0-MI/AAAAAAAANSc/h74SjsZGZzgce73aSxA4SoFNjc-o0-VGgCLcBGAsYHQ/w394-h400/good%2Boutcome%2Bvolatile.png&quot; width=&quot;394&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Footnote&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800180;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I will leave it to Dr. Eiko Fried (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1047840X.2020.1853461&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;) to explain whether we should accept (or reject) this bifactor model of “shared symptoms” vs. “unshared symptoms”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bell DE.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine proved highly effective in adults. Now it appears to work well in younger people too. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a Phase III clinical trial of 12- to 15-year-olds, participants who received the shot developed higher levels of antibodies to the coronavirus on average compared with vaccinated 16- to 25-year-olds &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-vaccine-pfizer-biontech-final-results&quot;&gt;from a previous trial&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/18/20&lt;/em&gt;). And those antibody levels make for a vaccine with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210331005503/en/&quot;&gt;high efficacy&lt;/a&gt;. None of the 1,131 vaccinated teens developed COVID-19 symptoms. There were 18 cases among the 1,129 youths in the unvaccinated group, Pfizer reported in a March 31 news release&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That 100 percent efficacy, based on a small number of cases overall, could decrease a bit as the trial continues because additional cases might pop up. Still, the results point to a vaccine that works well in adolescents. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The news is “astounding and very exciting,” Colleen Kelley, an infectious diseases physician at Emory University in Atlanta who helped lead a trial of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine, said in a call with reporters. Though Pfizer has not yet released all the data from the trial, protecting adolescents “will go a long way to end the pandemic,” she said. That’s because kids younger than 12 appear to be less likely than older kids to get infected with the coronavirus and pass it on to others.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shot’s side effects in the 12- to 15-year-olds were similar to those seen in the 16- to 25-year-old age group, the company said. The most common side effect in the older participants was pain at the injection site, followed by fatigue and headache.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pfizer plans to submit the data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as well as the European Medicines Agency, as soon as possible to ask that its emergency use authorizations be altered so that vaccinations can be expanded to those 12 and older.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last week, Pfizer began testing its vaccine in children ages 6 months to 11 years. Moderna started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-first-participants-dosed-phase-23-study-0&quot;&gt;trial of its vaccine&lt;/a&gt; in similarly aged children last week, and AstraZeneca launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.research.ox.ac.uk/Article/2021-02-12-oxford-university-extends-covid-19-vaccine-study-to-children&quot;&gt;trial of its vaccine&lt;/a&gt; in 6- to 17-year-olds in February.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infectious disease experts are optimistic that the vaccines could be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccines-children-kids-teens-ready-summer&quot;&gt;ready for kids&lt;/a&gt; as early as the summer (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/25/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Seventeen tiny particles recovered from a flat-topped mountain in eastern Antarctica suggest that a space rock shattered low in the atmosphere over the ice-smothered continent about 430,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The nickel- and magnesium-rich bits were sifted from more than 6 kilograms of loose sediments collected atop the 2,500-meter-tall summit of Walnumfjellet, says Matthias van Ginneken, a cosmochemist at the University of Kent in England. Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc1008&quot;&gt;exotic chemistry doesn’t match Earth rocks&lt;/a&gt;, but it does match the proportions of elements seen in a type of meteorite called a carbonaceous chondrite, van Ginneken and his colleagues report March 31 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of the particles range in size from 0.1 to 0.3 millimeters across, and more than half consist of spherules that are fused together into odd-shaped globs. The elemental mix in the spherules closely matches that of particles found at two other far-flung sites in Antarctica— one more than 2,750 kilometers away — which suggests that all of the materials originated in the same event. Because the other particles were found in ice cores and dated to about 430,000 years ago, the team presumes that the newly found particles from Walnumfjellet fell then too.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;spherule samples&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098038&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/033021_SP_airburstinline-1_desktop.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098038&quot;&gt;The chemistry of nickel- and magnesium-rich spherules (pictured) found on a mountaintop in Antarctica match that of a certain type of stony meteorites.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098038&quot;&gt;Scott Peterson/micro-meteorites.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;spherule samples&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098039&quot; height=&quot;421&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/033021_SP_airburstinline-1_mobile.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098039&quot;&gt;The chemistry of nickel- and magnesium-rich spherules (pictured) found on a mountaintop in Antarctica match that of a certain type of stony meteorites.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098039&quot;&gt;Scott Peterson/micro-meteorites.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The meteor that broke up over Antarctica was between 100 to 150 meters across, the team’s simulations suggest, and probably burst at low altitude. Blast waves may have pummeled a 100,000-square-kilometer area of the ice sheet, the team estimates. The explosion left no crater, but peak temperatures where the plume of hot gases reached Earth’s surface would have hit 5,000° Celsius and may have melted up to a few centimeters of ice. A similar airburst over a densely populated area today would result in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heres-how-asteroid-impact-would-kill-you&quot;&gt;millions of casualties&lt;/a&gt; and severely damage an area hundreds of kilometers across (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/2/17&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Using blobs of skin cells from frog embryos, scientists have grown creatures unlike anything else on Earth, a new study reports. These microscopic “living machines” can swim, sweep up debris and heal themselves after a gash.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists often strive to understand the world as it exists, says Jacob Foster, a collective intelligence researcher at UCLA not involved with this research. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://robotics.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.abf1571&quot;&gt;the new study&lt;/a&gt;, published March 31 in &lt;em&gt;Science Robotics&lt;/em&gt;, is part of a “liberating moment in the history of science,” Foster says. “A reorientation towards what is possible.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a way, the bots were self-made. Scientists removed small clumps of skin stem cells from frog embryos, to see what these cells would do on their own. Separated from their usual spots in a growing frog embryo, the cells organized themselves into balls and grew. About three days later, the clusters, called xenobots, began to swim.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Normally, hairlike structures called cilia on frog skin repel pathogens and spread mucus around. But on the xenobots, cilia allowed them to motor around. That surprising development “is a great example of life reusing what’s at hand,” says study coauthor Michael Levin, a biologist at Tufts University in Medford, Mass.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;animation of swarming xenobots&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098046&quot; height=&quot;381&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/033121_ls_frog-stem-cells_inline2_680.gif&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098046&quot;&gt;A swarm of xenobots (bright spots) swims around and pushes small particles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098046&quot;&gt;Douglas Blackiston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that process happens fast. “This isn’t some sort of effect where evolution has found a new use over hundreds of thousands of years,” Levin says. “This happens in front of your eyes within two or three days.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Xenobots have no nerve cells and no brains. Yet xenobots — each about half a millimeter wide — can swim through very thin tubes and traverse curvy mazes. When put into an arena littered with small particles of iron oxide, the xenobots can sweep the debris into piles. Xenobots can even heal themselves; after being cut, the bots zipper themselves back into their spherical shapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scientists are still working out the basics of xenobot life. The creatures can live for about 10 days without food. When fed sugar, xenobots can live longer (though they don’t keep growing). “We’ve grown them for over four months in the lab,” says study coauthor Doug Blackiston, also at Tufts. “They do really interesting things if you grow them,” including forming strange balloon-like shapes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;microscopic image of a xenobot&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098045&quot; height=&quot;453&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/033121_ls_frog-stem-cells_inline1_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098045&quot;&gt;This xenobot is about 500 micrometers across and is made of frog cells, even though it looks and acts nothing like an actual frog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098045&quot;&gt;Douglas Blackiston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not yet clear what sorts of jobs these xenobots might do, if any. Cleaning up waterways, arteries or other small spaces comes to mind, the researchers say. More broadly, these organisms may hold lessons about how bodies are built, Levin says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the advent of new organisms comes ethical issues, cautions Kobi Leins, a digital ethics researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia. “Scientists like to make things, and don’t necessarily think about what the repercussions are,” she says. More conversations about unintended consequences are needed, she says.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Levin agrees. The small xenobots are fascinating in their own rights, he says, but they raise bigger questions, and bigger possibilities. “It’s finding a whole galaxy of weird new things.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Invasive species can wreak havoc on local ecosystems. Cleaning up that biological wreckage comes at a big price.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These invaders, often thrust into new environments unintentionally (or intentionally, to combat pests) by humans, can transmit new diseases, devastate crops and eat away at crucial infrastructure. From 1970 to 2017, such invasions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03405-6&quot;&gt;cost the global economy at least $1.28 trillion &lt;/a&gt;in damages and in efforts to control them, researchers report March 31 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. As the globe becomes increasingly interconnected and invasive species take over new habitats, that cost grows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For decades, researchers have been evaluating the significant impacts of invasive species, but the problem isn’t well known by the public and policy makers,” says Boris Leroy, a biogeographer at the French National Museum of Natural History in Paris. “By estimating the global cost, we hoped to raise awareness of the issue and identify the most costly species.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leroy and his colleagues screened over 19,000 published papers, ultimately analyzing nearly 1,900 that detailed the costs of various invasions at particular times. The team then constructed a statistical model that estimated yearly costs, adjusting for factors like inflation, different currencies and timescales. Between 1970 and 2017, annual costs roughly doubled every six years, reaching a yearly bill of $162.7 billion in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Costly critters&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some invasive species cause more economic damage than others. Researchers analyzed published data from the past few decades to rank the 10 costliest species or species groups from 1970 to 2017. Total costs are broken down into damages, costs of managing invasive species, and costs that don’t fit neatly into one of those categories. Most of the top offenders are insects — mosquitoes head the list while screw-worm flies round it out — but cats, rats and some snakes are big troublemakers, too.  Gaps in data — on plants, for instance — likely skew these rankings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;The top 10 costliest invasive species, 1970&lt;img height=&quot;16&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/feed&quot; width=&quot;6&quot; /&gt;2017&lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;bar chart of the 10 most costly invasive species, 1970–2017&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098013&quot; height=&quot;509&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/033021_jl_invasive_inline1_desktop.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098013&quot;&gt;E. Otwell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;bar chart of 10 most costly invasive species, 1970–2017&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098012&quot; height=&quot;831&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/033021_jl_invasive_inline1_mobile.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098012&quot;&gt;E. Otwell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div style=&quot;line-height: 12px; font-size: 10px; height: auto; text-align: right;&quot;&gt;Source: C. Diagne &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; 2021&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Intensified global trade over that period gave invaders more opportunities to hitch rides on cargo ships or airplanes, the researchers say. And deforestation and agricultural expansion probably sped their spread by allowing easier access to pristine areas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the whole, cleaning up the damage caused by invasive species cost $892 billion, about 13 times higher than the $66 billion spent managing invasions, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a really ambitious effort,” says Helen Roy, an ecologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Wallingford, England. “There are major gaps in the data, which the authors are extremely transparent about,” she says. The analysis was heavily weighted towards North America, Europe and parts of Asia and Oceania. Agricultural pests, like insects, tended to be overrepresented in published literature compared with invasive plants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Still, getting a global look is very important,” Roy says. While this number is almost certainly an underestimate, she says, the study “shows us that this is a massive problem that’s getting worse.” Investing more in cargo inspections and other biosecurity measures or monitoring could help minimize these costs with comparatively small spending increases. “It’s much cheaper than waiting for the species to establish and spread widely before responding,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s a closer look at the top five costliest invasive species.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;1. &lt;em&gt;Aedes &lt;/em&gt;mosquitoes (&lt;em&gt;A. albopictus &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;A. aegypti&lt;/em&gt;): about $149 billion &lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Asian tiger mosquito (&lt;em&gt;A. albopictus&lt;/em&gt;) arrived in the United States in the mid-1980s, by way of hitchhiking in used tires shipped from its native Asia. First detected in Houston, it rapidly spread to 40 states. It’s also invaded parts of Europe, South America, Africa and Australia. &lt;em&gt;A. aegypti&lt;/em&gt;, or the yellow fever mosquito, is native to sub-Saharan Africa and spread around the world by similar methods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, these two mosquitoes cause significant damage to public health by transmitting a range of diseases like Zika, chikungunya, yellow fever and dengue, which accounts for the bulk of their cost. As the mosquitoes spread, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dengue-cases-americas-have-reached-all-time-high&quot;&gt;toll of these diseases grows&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;11/20/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;2. &lt;em&gt;Rattus&lt;/em&gt; (rats): about $67 billion&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These rodents’ worldwide occupation stems from about 3,000 years of hitchhiking on human boats. Once they arrive in a new location, rats often outcompete other small mammals, but can also harm birds and aquatic species. On islands around the world, rats have driven many species to extinction. For example, the Pacific rat, native to mainland southeast Asia, has snuffed out at least 1,000 species of island birds. Rats’ high cost stems from these biodiversity losses, but the rodents also can damage crops, destroy property and transmit disease (like the bubonic plague). &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;3. &lt;em&gt;Felis catus&lt;/em&gt; (cats): about $52 billion&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Native to Europe and the Middle East, our feline friends have established themselves on all nonfrozen continents. Cats are excellent predators, and can make a quick meal from a variety of prey, from insects to birds. By some estimates, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cats-kill-more-one-billion-birds-each-year&quot;&gt;cats kill a billion birds each year&lt;/a&gt; in the United States alone (&lt;em&gt;SN: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;1/29/13&lt;/em&gt;). The bulk of the economic damage inflicted by cats cataloged in Leroy’s analysis comes from their impact on native biodiversity and resulting losses in spending on birdwatching and hunting birds like ducks, pheasants and grouse. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;4. &lt;em&gt;Coptotermes formosanus&lt;/em&gt; (termites): about $19 billion&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These subterranean termites native to East Asia have spread around the globe via trade. Termites can thrive wherever there is cellulose (like wood) and moisture, which has helped them quickly establish colonies upon being introduced to a new region. Their appetite for wood can wreak havoc on all kinds of structures, from homes to bridges. While they can also damage crops and tree farms, their high cost in this analysis boils down to their impact on infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;5. &lt;em&gt;Solenopsis invicta&lt;/em&gt; (fire ants): about $17 billion&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fire ants usually become the dominant ant species when introduced to a new region, due to their aggressive foraging tactics, which include potent stings and bites. Native to South America, these ants arrived in the United States in the 1930s by boat, most likely carried in soil from the region. They’ve also spread to Australia, New Zealand, China and around the Caribbean. Fire ant colonies have wide-ranging impacts; they can feed on a variety of seedlings, from citrus to soybeans, reduce the size of grazing lands for livestock and bite and sting farm animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Africa’s southern Kalahari Desert is not typically regarded as a hotbed of Stone Age innovations. And yet human culture blossomed there around 105,000 years ago, back when it was green, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Calcite crystals and other finds at a South African rock-shelter more than 600 kilometers from the nearest shoreline reflect &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03419-0&quot;&gt;cultural behaviors on a par&lt;/a&gt; with those previously reported for ancient humans living on or near South Africa’s coast, researchers report March 31 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. Those coastal sites date to between roughly 125,000 and 70,000 years ago, including one where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-paint-shop-unearthed&quot;&gt;locals used tools to make paint out of pigment around 100,000 years ago&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/13/11&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the scarcity of human sites from that time period, it’s hard to know whether cultural innovations emerged independently in groups spread across southern Africa or originated in one particular region before being adopted elsewhere. But the new discoveries fit a scenario in which “the emergence of &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; involved the interaction of many different populations across Africa,” says archaeologist Jayne Wilkins of Griffith University in Nathan, Australia. “And that included the Kalahari Desert.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Excavations at Ga-Mohana Hill North Rockshelter, or GHN, uncovered an ancient sediment layer containing 42 burned ostrich eggshell fragments and 22 palm-sized or smaller calcite crystals, Wilkins and her colleagues report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;calcite crystal samples&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098002&quot; height=&quot;565&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/033121_bb_inland-ancestors_inline2_mobile_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098002&quot;&gt;Stone Age humans based in a “green” Kalahari collected calcite crystals that they may have viewed as having ritual or symbolic meanings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098002&quot;&gt;J. Wilkins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like some African hunter-gatherer groups today, ancient people at GHN may have cut holes out of ostrich eggshells to create water containers, the researchers say. Geologic studies indicated that enough rain once fell over the southern Kalahari Desert to have produced year-round water sources for ancient GHN people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many eggshell pieces showed discoloration from burning. It’s not clear how that burning occurred. Eggshells lay among numerous animal bones, some of which displayed possible butchery marks and signs of burning.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The calcite crystals were probably collected from local rock sources, one of which lies about 2.5 kilometers from the rock-shelter, the scientists suspect. Excavated calcite crystals hadn’t been modified in any way and had no apparent practical use, raising the possibility that these items held ritual or symbolic significance, Wilkins suspects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Crystals have been linked to spiritual beliefs and rituals in many parts of the world. Until now, the oldest set of crystals dated to around 80,000 years ago at another South African rock-shelter located about 130 kilometers from the coast, Wilkins says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other GHN finds included hundreds of stone tools, prepared rock chunks from which tools were struck and a piece of red pigment bearing scrape marks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;hand holding stone tool&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3098001&quot; height=&quot;1046&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/033121_bb_inland-ancestors_inline1_vertical_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3098001&quot;&gt;A stone tool unearthed at an inland African site belongs to a set of artifacts pointing to ancient cultural advances among humans who lived far from resource-rich coastlines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3098001&quot;&gt;J. Wilkins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ancient &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-00795-5&quot;&gt;cultural evolution&lt;/a&gt; in many parts of Africa remains a mystery, writes archaeologist Pamela Willoughby of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, in a commentary published with the new study. Calcite crystals found at GHN perhaps represent “an early example of ritualistic symbolic behavior,” according to Willoughby.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Any ritualistic use of the GHN crystals is difficult to demonstrate, contends archaeologist Manuel Will of the University of Tübingen in Germany. Ostrich eggshell pieces found at the Kalahari site could have been discarded after a meal, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the new study adds to growing skepticism about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/waters-edge-ancestors&quot;&gt;claims that human cultural advances started along African coasts&lt;/a&gt;, Will says (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/29/11&lt;/em&gt;). It’s possible, though, that bountiful habitats along southern Africa’s coastline fostered an especially broad range of cultural innovations, he suggests. Coastal sites have yielded items that weren’t found inland at GHN, including beads, bone tools and ostrich eggshells bearing engraved designs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/31/companies-succession-announcements-can-inadvertently-make-work-life-harder-for-incoming-female-ceos/"/>

		<updated>2021-03-31T11:17:20+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When an organisation appoints a new male CEO, the announcement will typically highlight his past achievements and the competencies that make him ideal for the job. What if the new CEO is a woman? The widely expected, gender-neutral thing to do is, of course, to make precisely the same type of announcement. However, according to the team behind a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-19394-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, this can make work life more difficult for her, and shorten the time that she spends in that role. Priyanka Dwiwedi at Texas A&amp;amp;M University and her colleagues base this striking conclusion on an extensive analysis of data on women who have been appointed to top positions in the US, as well as in-depth interviews with female executives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41702&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why might an announcement that focuses on the winning candidate’s past successes and competences affect a female vs a male leader differently? Perhaps, the team theorised, it might showcase “that the new female leader does not adhere to prescriptive norms about how women ‘should be’. Such violations could elicit social disapproval, backlash and evaluation penalties for women.” In other words, new female leaders who are praised for their competence, confidence and ambition (stereotypically “male”-type leadership traits) may then experience “stereotype threat” — and feel judged for not conforming to the stereotypically female profile of being nurturing, socially sensitive and group-focused. The psychological burden of this could then make it harder for the woman to remain in her job. Lab-based work has supported these ideas, and there has been some anecdotal evidence in its favour, too. But this is the first attempt at major, real-world investigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To start with, the team considered 91 female CEO successions among companies included in major US stock market indices between 1995 and 2012. When a host of other factors that could plausibly have influenced any CEO’s longevity were taken into account, the researchers noted a link between endorsements that focused on success and competence and a shorter time as CEO. (These endorsements came from the companies’ own websites, press releases and annual reports, for example.) Two factors did emerge as being linked to a longer time in the job despite success-focused endorsements, however: the female CEO being an internal rather than an external appointment, and the presence of a relatively high number of female executives in the company. Analysis of a matched sample of male CEOs did not reveal a link between endorsement content and time in the role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team then ran semi-structured interviews with 31 female executives (not all CEOs, though all in senior management positions), each with an average of 25 years’ experience at a variety of US companies. The findings from this qualitative portion of the study supported the team’s idea that such women are subject to stereotype threat. They found that “female executives were chronically aware of gender stereotyping and continued biases in the male-dominated context of upper echelons both during their transition into, and throughout their time in, their executive roles.” These women also reported all kinds of negative personal responses, including anxiety about being perceived as incompetent, or having insufficient legitimacy as a leader, as well as feeling exhausted with dealing with the stereotypes. For example, one commented: “When a woman is demanding, they think she’s a bitch… But if a man is demanding, they see him as tough and good.” Another talked about how, as she moved up the ranks, she felt much more hostility and exclusion — so much so, that she eventually quit her job.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The interview-based segment of the study supports the idea that women in top leadership roles suffer from unhelpful stereotypes about women. When it comes to the team’s main conclusion, however — that the content of the endorsement of a new female CEO can affect her longevity in the job — it’s important to note that the link is correlational. (Though the team’s failure to find such an association for the male CEOs is certainly worth stressing.) Though the researchers did control for a lot of other potential influences on their results, this study could not definitively demonstrate that the content of the appointee endorsement in and of itself &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt; greater or lesser stereotype-related pressures on a female CEO. But if their suggestion that it does is correct, what are the practical lessons?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It does pose a dilemma for companies, the researchers accept. “While they would do well to support their new female leaders in as many ways as they can, they also need to constantly recognise that any such support could backfire because of implicit gender biases and stereotyping”. The team did find that the presence of more female executives mitigated this, though. So: “Perhaps the only long-term solution to this dilemma is for organisations to obtain a critical mass of female leaders in order to buffer them against potentially negative stakeholder perceptions.” They add that though this study focused on women, it’s likely that CEOs from other minorities in the executive level in businesses will experience something very similar. The finding also contributes to the growing body of work finding that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/15/saying-that-girls-are-just-as-good-as-boys-at-maths-can-inadvertently-perpetuate-gender-stereotypes/&quot;&gt;well-intentioned attempts to counteract gender stereotypes can backfire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-19394-001&quot;&gt;“Burnt by the spotlight”: How leadership endorsements impact the longevity of female leaders.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/person-2244036_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-harm is often the result of a complex interplay of genetic- biological, psychological and environmental factors. Bullying is one aspect that can increase the risk of self-harm. However not all adolescents who experience bullying harm themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bullies are also at risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not only being the victim of bullying that is related to self-harm, but also being a bully aggressor. In fact, in our study we found that adolescents who are both bullies and are bullied by their peers (the bully-victims), were the group most vulnerable to self-harm. They were six times more likely to self-harm than adolescents who weren’t bullies or bullied&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible that the “bully-victims” have the broadest range of adjustment problems, presenting difficulties common to both bullies and victims. An earlier study found that many of the bully-victims first have a history of being bullied, and then begin to bully peers later in adolescence. Thus, they suffer from both emotional and behavioral problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is there a relationship between self-harm and bullying behavior?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both bullying victimization and self-harm are associated with emotional problems such as anxiety and depression. In our study we found that emotional problems and parental conflicts were important factors for the association between the bullied adolescents and self-harm, and between the bully-victims and self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study showed that school behavioral problems also accounted for some of the relationship between self-harm and the bullies, and self-harm and bully-victims. This confirms the idea that the act of bullying is part of a broader concept of conduct behavioral problems with aggressive and delinquent behaviors, school failure, and drop out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parental support and school well-being&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;School well-being (including support from teacher) was protective of self-harm for the bullies and the bully-victims&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we see that those who are bullied and/or bullies may be more likely to engage in self-harm, we know that not everyone who is bullied or bullies self-harms. We therefore investigated what might protect against self-harm amongst the bullies, bullied and bully-victims. We found that although parental support had a protective effect on self-harm among boys and girls in general, it was especially important for those who are bullied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows that the willingness to talk to and seek help from parents during a difficult time like bullying, may protect against self-harm among adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were surprised to also find that school well-being (including support from teacher) was protective of self-harm for the bullied and the bully-victims. Our result appears to be the first to investigate the buffering effect of school well-being on bullying behavior and self-harm among adolescents. This is an important result for the prevention of self-harm. Schools, parents, and health care professionals should be aware of the importance of school well-being for adolescents who are being bullied, in terms of identifying those at risk of self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How frequent is self-harm?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study showed that fifteen percent of participating adolescents reported engaging in self-harm during the last year. This is consistent with earlier studies finding the 12-month prevalence rate to be between 10 to 19% around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3348041/&quot;&gt;the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who participated in the study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data we used in this study was the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ungdata.no/english/&quot;&gt;Ungdata&lt;/a&gt;” that is a cross-sectional, large, national survey, designed for adolescents. A total of 14 093 adolescents aged 12 to 19 years, from different parts of Norway, participated in the study; this was 87% of those invited to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data was collected at one point in time and therefore we do not know if the bullying occurred prior to self-harm. However, previous longitudinal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890856713001834&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that bullying increased the risk of self-harm and not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we measured self-harm and bulling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We measured self-harm by asking if the adolescents had tried to harm them self in the past 12 months. Bullied was measured by asking adolescent if they had been teased, threatened, or frozen out by other young people in school, free time, online, or on their mobile phones. Bullying other peers was measured by asking if they had taken part in teasing, threatening or freezing out out other young people at school, free time, online or by mobile phone. We created a new variable to measure those both being bullied and who bully others (the bully-victims), by combining the variables “Bullied” and “Bullying other peers”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of parental support and school well-being may buffer the harmful relationship between bullying behavior and self-harm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a strong link between bullying and self-harm. Interventions to address bullying may reduce self-harm. Our findings also suggest that high levels of parental support and school well-being may buffer the harmful relationship between bullying behavior and self-harm. Addressing these factors may be important in reducing the risk of self-harm among those experiencing bullying.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/IQFg2gChmhg/"/>

		<updated>2021-03-31T04:59:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; has adopted an enhanced &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/code-availability&quot;&gt;code sharing policy&lt;/a&gt; for all papers submitted from 30 March 2021. The change, announced in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008867&quot;&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt;, comes in response to community needs and support for initiatives which drive Open Science practices. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Community drivers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Code sharing is not new to many of our authors. Research shows that 41% of papers in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; already share code voluntarily (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008725&quot;&gt;Boudreau &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; 2021&lt;/a&gt;), demonstrating the community’s willingness to make their work both rapidly available and methodologically transparent. This creates a strong foundation for implementing a stronger policy and also works towards establishing code sharing as a normal research behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; defines “open” as more than the availability of a research article. Our authors, editors, and readers see data and code sharing as tools to boost reproducibility and transparency. Sharing code alongside data will allow others to check and reproduce work and ultimately drive new discoveries. Requiring authors to share their code (unless there are good reasons not to) works towards making the research published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; as robust as possible for the benefit of the whole research community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In developing &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/code-availability&quot;&gt;the policy&lt;/a&gt; we sought views from researchers in the computational community on the barriers they face when sharing code (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13366025&quot;&gt;Harney &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. 2021&lt;/a&gt;). We then tested our policy text with researchers to help inform its design and content. This has allowed us to respond to researcher needs, for example by allowing exemptions to the policy for those with legitimate legal or ethical constraints on sharing. In this way, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; continues to be shaped by policies the community has helped define, and Open Science values that reflect the way they want to communicate research. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Open Science at PLOS&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Open Science is one of our founding principles at PLOS. Enhancing the code sharing policy at one of our journals in response to community needs is just one step we are making to increase the adoption of Open Science practices. We aim to empower researchers to share their good practices because we believe communities are best placed to define their own needs. The computational biology community is shaping the future of research communication by leading the way in practices that make science more open and equitable for all. However, we do offer guidance and help to those who need it, for example, by detailing best practice for code sharing alongside our policy text. No matter how researchers choose to make their work Open, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; provides options to support researcher needs and the platform to influence broader change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Collaboration with the community and responding to their needs is part of our approach to Open Science, regardless of how that community is defined. We will be closely monitoring the reaction to the code sharing policy at &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; and exploring what an enhanced policy could mean for other communities that we serve. &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A key facet of cognitive behavioural therapy is challenging “cognitive distortions”, inaccurate thought patterns that often affect those with depression. Such distortions could include jumping to conclusions, catastrophising, black and white thinking, or self-blame — and can cause sincere distress to those experiencing them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But how do we track cognitive distortion in those with depression outside of self-reporting? A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01050-7&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01050-7&quot;&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, explores cognitive distortions online, finding that those with depression have higher levels of distortion in the language they use on social media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41691&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Krishna Bathina from Indiana University Bloomington and colleagues looked at the language of over 6 million tweets from 7,349 Twitter accounts, some who had previously tweeted that they had a diagnosis of depression and some who were randomly selected. The researchers were specifically interested in how often these tweets contained 241 phrases which they considered to be the “building blocks” of various cognitive distortions associated with depression. For instance, the phrase “everyone believes” was taken to be part of the “mindreading” distortion, in which people think that they know what others are thinking. Other cognitive distortions include catastrophising, overgeneralisation, and discounting positive experiences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Results showed that those who had tweeted about a diagnosis of depression used significantly more of the cognitive distortion phrases than those in the random condition. This was true for nearly all of the 12 cognitive distortion types, except for fortune-telling (predicting a negative outcome), mind reading and catastrophising, which were not significantly different between the two groups. The distortion types that were most prevalent in the depression cohort compared to the control group were personalising (taking things personally) and emotional reasoning (mistaking a feeling for a fact).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This could mean that depression could be tracked via language — particularly online, where people may be more open about what they’re thinking and feeling.  The team also suggests  that the findings could have an impact on the way cognitive behavioural therapy is actually delivered: how certain types of language are used can reflect specific cognitive distortions and therefore give better insight for targeted, relevant treatment.      &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But although all data was anonymised, the team acknowledges that scraping data on mental health from users of social platforms throws up tricky ethical issues; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/29/psychologists-are-mining-social-media-posts-for-mental-health-research-but-many-users-have-concerns/&quot;&gt;some users&lt;/a&gt; have expressed serious discomfort at their personal information being used without consent. The team suggests that in the future “automated interventions” for depression could target people using such language on social media — but when so many people use social platforms to express themselves and find a space and community to support them, such interventions may be unwanted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are also questions about the self-disclosure of those in the depression condition. Firstly, there was no way for researchers to verify the diagnoses; secondly, there may have been many in the random condition with diagnoses they just never thought or wanted to share. Although jokey tweets were filtered out (e.g. “That Game of Thrones episode has given me a diagnosis of depression”), the language of mental illness is often co-opted or used in an exaggerated fashion — &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/12/10/liberal-americans-distress-at-2016-election-result-shouldnt-be-labelled-depression-study-argues/&quot;&gt;after political defeats&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Looking at the subtlety of online communications may also provide different and interesting answers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01050-7&quot;&gt;Individuals with depression express more distorted thinking on social media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &quot;the Committee believes that when carelessness or scientific dishonesty can be found in so many articles with so many different authors in question, there must be a lack of training and / or lack of control over data handling. The committee therefore believes that it is qualified probability that there has been an institutional system error when it comes to training. The committee believes that good routines for training are a line responsibility and can not only be attributed to group or project manager.&quot;</content>

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/29/frequent-workplace-interruptions-are-annoying-but-may-also-help-you-feel-that-you-belong/"/>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Workplace disturbances during the Covid-19 pandemic aren’t quite what they used to be. Now you’re more likely to be interrupted by a cat jumping on your keyboard or a partner trying to make a cup of tea while you’re in a meeting — but if you can cast your mind back to what it was like to work in an office, perhaps you can recall how annoying it was to be disturbed by colleagues dropping by with questions or comments. These “workplace intrusions” used to be common in offices, and no doubt will be again. There’s certainly plenty of evidence that they interfere with our ability to complete tasks, and that we can find them stressful. However, no one’s really considered potential benefits, note Harshad Puranik at the University of Illinois and colleagues. In their &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-19397-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Advanced Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, the team reports that though there is a dark side to these interruptions, there’s a bright side, too. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41679&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before the pandemic, Puranik and his colleagues studied 111 people with an average age of about 35 who worked full time. At around noon every work day for three weeks, these participants used simple scales to report any work intrusions (such as being interrupted by someone who wanted to ask questions or to assign them a new task); their stocks of willpower for self-regulation (reporting on their level of agreement with “I feel drained right now”, for example); their sense of how connected they felt with other people at work (a measure of “belongingness”); and also their stress levels. In the late afternoon each day, they completed a second brief survey, which assessed their level of job satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consistent with earlier work, the team found that more work intrusions were associated with less energy for self-regulation — which helps you to immediately return to a task after being disturbed, rather than do a bit of online shopping, for example. What’s more, statistically speaking, this depleted self-regulation explained a further link between more work intrusions and lower job satisfaction. So far, so dark-side.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also found, however, that work intrusions are not all bad. In fact, more work intrusions were associated with higher ratings for belongingness. High belongingness ratings were also independently linked with greater job satisfaction; though the association between more disturbances and higher ratings for belongingness was not strong enough to produce a net increase in job satisfaction, it did seem to mitigate the negative effects of being disturbed. “To our knowledge,” they write, “this is the first evidence of a positive relationship between work intrusions and job satisfaction, implying this relationship might be more nuanced than previously thought.” They add that “to our knowledge, this is the first study to show that in a workplace setting, experiencing belongingness can somewhat counteract the effects of self-regulatory resource depletion.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though some people will continue to work from home after lockdown restrictions lift, many of us are now preparing to return to offices. Pre-Covid-19, workplace intrusions were described as a “common and consistent” feature of work life for people in many different kinds of jobs. Given that the consensus to date has been that they carry only downsides, these new findings of a belongingness boost are worth noting. “We believe this is a crucial insight,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-19397-001&quot;&gt;Excuse me, do you have a minute? An exploration of the dark- and bright-side effects of daily work interruptions for employee well-being.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like humans, octopuses have both an active and quiet stage of sleep, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/03/octopuses-humans-sleep-two-stages&quot;&gt;reports Rodrigo Pérez Ortega&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers found that for 30-40 minutes of sleep the creatures are fairly still with pale skin, but for about 40 seconds their skin turns darker and they move their eyes and body&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;In humans, dreaming happens in the active, REM stage, but scientists still don’t know whether the octopuses also dream during their active sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41667&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During the pandemic we haven’t only missed out on socialising — we’ve also been deprived of novel experiences&lt;/strong&gt;. And a lack of novelty can be detrimental to our wellbeing and even our cognitive functioning, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/25/ecstatic-shopping-trip-novelty-brain-lockdown-spontaneity-learning-memory&quot;&gt;writes Richard A Friedman&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A growing body of evidence suggests that sustaining head injuries in sports raises the risk of players developing neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;/strong&gt;Now a longitudinal study following a cohort of Americans has found that even mild head injuries can increase the risk of dementia, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/even-mild-brain-injuries-raise-the-risk-of-dementia/&quot;&gt;reports Sara Harrison&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;. The team also found that the increase in risk was greater for women than men and for White than Black people, but more work is needed to understand these differences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s going on in our brains when we look at a cute little baby or kitten? &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;Science Focus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/neuroscience-of-cute/&quot;&gt;Thomas Ling explores&lt;/a&gt; the neuroscience of cuteness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people who have recovered from Covid-19 report a loss of smell — or experience previously nice smells as unpleasant. And that can have devastating social consequences&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/style/smell-covid-dating-parosmia.html&quot;&gt;writes Alyson Krueger&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;: many sufferers report that they are no longer able to be intimate with loved ones or eat meals with friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists have looked at the personality and cognitive abilities of “psychonauts”, people who experiment with psychedelic drugs and document their experiences. &lt;/strong&gt;This group showed high levels of sensation-seeking and risk-taking, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/psychedelic-drugs-how-the-brains-of-informed-users-are-different-156244&quot;&gt;report the researchers, Barbara Sahakian and George Savulich&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;. But they didn’t have any deficits in learning and memory (unlike a group of “club drug” users who were seeking help for addiction), suggesting that they were avoiding harmful patterns of drug use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being kind to ourselves is vital for our wellbeing and personal growth — and yet a lot of us are not very good at it. &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;Psyche&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyche.co/ideas/self-compassion-is-not-self-indulgence-heres-how-to-try-it&quot;&gt;Christina Chwyl examines&lt;/a&gt; the research around self-compassion, and explores how we might become better friends to ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content&quot;&gt;Neuromatch Academy 2020&lt;/a&gt; is a three-week online summer school in computational neuroscience that took place in July of 2020. We created interactive notebooks covering all aspects of computational neuroscience – from signals and models of spikes to machine learning and behaviour. We hired close to 200 TAs to teach this material to 1,700 students from all over the world in an inverted classroom setting. Over 87% of students that started the class finished it, a number unheard of in the MOOC space. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08973&quot;&gt;we have a preprint out&lt;/a&gt;, and NMA has been covered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02347-9&quot;&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(21)00074-0/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email&quot;&gt;the Lancet&lt;/a&gt;. So how did we do it? Building something that goes from 0 to several hundred volunteers working tirelessly is a huge endeavor, and I’m sure a lot of the readers of this blog coming from an academic background have trouble even imagining how you can get something like that off the ground. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rdgao.com/blog/2020/09/16/&quot;&gt;Richard Gao wrote a great post&lt;/a&gt; on how it felt to be flying in this anarchist hacker spaceship as it was being built. I wanted to share some thoughts with you that I hope will be helpful if you ever want to create an experience at this scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;A little background: my stint into teaching&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After my time at Facebook, I wanted to focus on the academic route. I became interested in teaching and taught an introductory CS class at a local college, building my materials from scratch. I thought, rather naively, that since I knew CS, this would be fairly straightforward. But preparing course materials materials for beginners is anything but easy. One issue is the curse of expertise: if you know a subject pretty well it becomes harder to explain it to a novice. For example, here’s my explanation of globals in Python:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python has two scopes: module and function. You have read access to module variables inside of a function. However, if you want to write to a module variable it, you need to use the global keyword. Unless the variable is a reference type… If a variable is a dict or a list, for example, you can change its contents inside a function even if it’s a module variable. That’s because Python has pass-by-ref semantics for complex types. You see, default pass-by-ref semantics for complex types were originally introduced in fourth generation languages to get rid of the difficulty of granular pass-by-value or pass-by-ref semantics in languages like C. […many rambling minutes later…]. In any case, don’t use globals if you can avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although this explanation is technically correct, it doesn’t fit with novice students’ current development, and giving that explanation is more likely to make them feel inadequate than enlightened. It takes a tremendous amount of attention to detail, radical empathy and craftsmanship to understand the adult learner’s motivations – both intrinsic and extrinsic – and to create materials that engage them at the right level. And creating this stuff takes a huge amount of time! By the time I finished the class, I was ready to throw away the material I created. At the same time, it felt quixotic to take half a year off to craft the perfect materials for a class that was going to be taken by ~15 students a semester. The lack of good materials meant that I had to spend much of my time in class on adjusting materials dynamically – at the end of the day, I was completely exhausted. Surely, there must be a better way!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response to the global pandemic, Chris Piech and Mehran Sahami decided to offer the first half of the  introductory Stanford CS class to students at large, an experiment called &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Code in Place&lt;/a&gt;. Over 800 section leaders signed up to give 6 weeks of instruction on core computational concepts in Python. Here was a completely different approach to teaching a subject: very high quality materials crafted over years at Stanford – &lt;a href=&quot;https://compedu.stanford.edu/karel-reader/docs/python/en/chapter1.html&quot;&gt;including a robot-control environment in Python called Karel&lt;/a&gt; – given in a hybrid setting, with the section leader (aka TA) holding Q&amp;amp;A sessions and solving test problems with students in an inverted classroom setting. And it worked! Students were engaged and stuck around, and they worked on self-directed projects to continue their learning. What I found is that by not having to focus so much on materials prep and the fallout from having so-so materials, I had more time to connect with the students on an emotional, social level – understanding what they’re stuck on, where they’re coming from, what their motivations are, etc.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/image.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7558&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7558&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/image.png?w=328&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/image.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/image.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;328,254&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-7/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/image.png?w=328&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Karel is an environment where students can learn basis of programming, including variables, if statements, for loops and decomposition, by controlling a cute robot on a grid called Karel&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A few weeks into Code In Place, I came across Konrad Kording’s Twitter post looking for NMA volunteers. By that time, they had a core team – Megan in the Exec role, Sean as finance guru, Brad as ops, Konrad as dreamer, Gunnar and Paul on curriculum. They had just gotten started, they needed people with technical skills. I took on the technical chair, things escalated, and within a few weeks I was CTO and along with many other, was doing NMA full time. My time in industry proved to be an asset  – working with short deadlines, focusing on shipping, and managing relationships with a large interdisciplinary team. Pretty soon, I was helping coordinate dozens of volunteers, a growth experience that I didn’t know I was ready for. So &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2020/02/18/how-i-got-a-job-in-industry/&quot;&gt;if you’re wondering whether industry is right for you&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to build big things and manage big collaborations in the future, I think it’s a great place to get that experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Deciding what to build&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you first get started on a large project like this, you get overwhelmed with ideas about what it is that you’re trying to build. One framework for orienting your thoughts are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism&quot;&gt;Heilmeier questions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the risks?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How much will it cost?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How long will it take?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you can answer these questions, you know what you’re building, and you can get a team to congregate around those ideas. This isn’t very different, conceptually, from writing a grant. For us, it was really the fundraising document that formalized a lot of our early brainstorming The answer to these questions could be written simply as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’re building an online, 3-week intensive summer school in computational neuroscience. It will be cheap (100$ or less to attend) and accessible to all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Traditional summer schools offer a great experience and the chance to create life-long scientific networks, but they are elitist and expensive. MOOCs are cheap and accessible to all but a vanishingly small percentage of people actually complete them because they don’t foster belonging. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We create high-quality videos and interactive notebooks and we deliver them in pods of students matched to TAs. We offer the close-knit experience of traditional summer schools with the accessibility of MOOCs in a new hybrid model. People are bored and alone because of COVID so we have a unique opportunity to show that this online inverted classroom model can work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ll bring cheap high-quality education to thousands of people and will set the standard for open source educational materials for years to come. We can bring the model to many other areas of science.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Execution risk and legal risk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1500$ for each TA, and we’re aiming for 200 TAs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’re launching July 13th&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ll track attendance, completion metrics, students surveys, website statistics, etc. to have a 360 view of our impact. Our core metric is completion of the class and we aim for 80% completion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within each committee, you can take Heilmeier’s questions and consider their relevance to your  committee’s duties. The curriculum committee’s goal might be to create high-quality materials for the class, while the technical committee might aim to deliver 99% uptime during the class. The point is to try to have clarity on your goals so that when crunch time happens you can prioritize.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Running on enthusiasm&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was really enthusiastic about taking what I learned from Code in Place and bringing that to computational neuroscience. The core team had been thinking about a new kind of summer school for years before NMA got started and they were ready to tap into their network to jump start the effort. In the early days, being enthusiastic about the project and having a great story to tell are instrumental in finding volunteers. We’re democratizing education! We’re bringing grad-level education to underserved communities! We’re doing something no one’s ever done! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I volunteer at a soup kitchen, and one thing they emphasized during our training is that a volunteer’s time is a  gift. You have to have a pipeline that translates a volunteer’s enthusiasm into action, otherwise you’re refusing to accept that gift, and that’s frustrating for the volunteer. At first, we would bring new people into our slack workspace and expected them to find their way. We realized pretty soon that having people in the slack is just the first step – you need to have a plan to retain volunteers. This became especially true as the slack workspace shot up to hundreds, sometimes thousands of messages a day. Empathize with those poor people just joining in being bombarded with way too much information! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the technical committee, what worked well to engage new volunteers is to do a task triage. There’s a backlog of stuff that needs to be done – update the website, crank out some forms, clean up the github page, prepare the forum, etc. In a synchronous meeting, you go through the backlog and people volunteer to take on different tasks. That means your committee head needs to have tasks partly groomed beforehand. They pull up the Kanban board during the meeting and fill it in – we used &lt;a href=&quot;http://quire.io/&quot;&gt;quire&lt;/a&gt;, but Asana or even just a Google doc could work equally well. Everybody gets a chance to pitch in, and confusion about the scope of each task can be resolved during the meeting. It’s also a big team-building exercise: you get to see other people pitch in. We applied this method to build several efforts, including bootstrapping the technical team, the video editing team, the waxers team (see later), community managers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you prefer the asynchronous route, Github tasks with a good-for-first-timers tag can be useful. Regardless of the software you use, you want to embody openness: you want tasks to be done to be radically transparent and for volunteers to feel maximal agency. This is a common model for open source communities that can be fruitfully adapted to education.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Running like clockwork&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Assigning tasks of different sizes and priority as a backlog grooming session is great to engage new volunteers, but you will also need to do time-sensitive tasks. For time-sensitive things, you need a Gantt chart with a detailed day-by-day breakdown of tasks to be done with somebody accountable for each task (the single-threaded owner). I was taught the arcane art of Gantt charts by my colleagues Keith and Frances at Facebook, alums of Fitbit and the Apple hardware team. Let me tell you something, if you want to get stuff done on time, somebody that knows how to ship hardware will make it happen – when you build consumer products, you have to ship them on time, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an online summer school, that means having deadlines for student admissions, TA applications, first drafts of content, second drafts of content, reviews, editing, posting on github, etc. for every single day of content. The deadlines should be visible to everybody, and the people responsible for them should be accountable. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emdupre&quot;&gt;Elizabeth DuPre&lt;/a&gt; pointed me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_4EX4dPppA&amp;amp;ab_channel=StrangeLoopConference&quot;&gt;this talk by the creator of Elm&lt;/a&gt; – in open source projects, the right culture doesn’t just happen by accident, culture happens because norms are defined and reinforced. “Deadlines matter” is a norm that is different than what most people are used to in the context of giving instruction. If you’re giving your own class, you can keep editing your slides up to 2 minutes before the class. You can’t do that at NMA – your slides will be reviewed, your video recording will be edited, your video will be captioned, etc. – if you hand in your slides late, everybody down the pipeline suffers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want deadlines to matter you have to will them into existence by making them a norm inside of an organization and reinforcing that by making them visible to everybody. Keeping track of these deadlines eventually led to a daily cadence of standups, which I ran – ironic because I always hated standups in industry. Konrad once called me “a little German” for my insistence on deadlines, which is very funny since I’m almost absurdly disorganized in my personal life.  Being inside of a big org is different. &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractualism/&quot;&gt;It’s an embodiment of a deeper principle of contractualism&lt;/a&gt; – we define and agree on what we owe to each other and bind ourselves to that, and that’s what defines morality within our community. The upside of that is the contract is multilateral. When we couldn’t get the ideal matching method between TAs and students to work on time, but we had a “good enough” version that was working, I could say to others that we have to ship the good enough version today, because we agreed to it; it gave me cover, even though it was an unpopular decision. That kind of clarity in planning and expectations avoids a lot of friction later on. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;You need good tools to work productively with each other&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month&quot;&gt;The Mythical Man-Month&lt;/a&gt;, Fred Brooks claims that “adding [more programmers] to a late software project makes it later”. When you have dozens of contributors to an open-source education curriculum, how do you avoid that? You need good tools. One of the first things that the technical team worked on was a smoke test for notebooks. We were worried that one of the notebooks that we use for teaching might break. Notebooks are designed for exploration and can be pretty brittle – a simple cell execution order inconsistency can break a notebook. If multiple people are editing and pushing notebooks, it’s almost guaranteed that a notebook will break at some point. If a notebook is broken, an individual TA might not have enough context to diagnose the problem, and we would have to broadcast to our 200 TAs a fix, which would be stressful for TA and student alike.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So we started with a really simple smoke test, written by Marco. When you push notebooks to Github, the continuous integration kicks in, runs your notebook from scratch, and check whether it runs. From these humble beginnings, Michael Waskom built an intricate continuous integration (CI) pipeline to check that the code runs, that the style is consistent, and to generate versions of the notebooks for students and TAs, etc. This is the thing that allowed the editors to push better versions of the notebooks on a regular basis, and proved invaluable during a time crunch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we used an online video editing tool (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wevideo.com/&quot;&gt;WeVideo&lt;/a&gt;) rather than an offline one because it allowed multiple people to contribute to video editing. That allowed Tara to oversee a dozen video editors and reassign tasks when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;You need good organization to work productively with each&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to get a lot of people to contribute lots of content is to have them work in silos. Each of our instruction days was more or less independent of the others, so it made sense to have different people work on each independently. The downside to this approach is that it makes for a jumbled experience for the student. Novice learners, who don’t yet have proficiency in a subject, can easily be thrown off by a change in notation, nomenclature, or tone. Day leaders created one pagers far ahead of the content so we could diagnose missing prerequisites, incompatible learning objectives and big bumps in difficulty throughout the days. But that wasn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biggest contributors to a smooth experience for the students were pre-pods and waxers. When I was giving an introductory CS class, I could see the looks of confusion on student’s faces. I could adjust the content in realtime (a high-wire experience, do not recommend). Ideally I would have had another test classroom run through the content in real time to give me detailed notes so I could improve the content before I gave the class in front of the actual students. That’s exactly what we did with pre-pods: we hired a dozen TAs to test the content 3 weeks before the real class (pods before the real ones; hence pre-pods). They gave 360 feedback at the micro level (e.g. typos) and macro level (e.g. changes in difficulty from day to day) which could then be taken into account by the content creators. It’s not adversarial like peer review can sometimes feel – everybody is on the same side. It’s similar to UI/UX testing, where you put your product in front of naive users and watch them destroy it from the other side of the one-way mirror so you can make a better product. &lt;a href=&quot;https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/design-thinking/steps/introduction/&quot;&gt;This kind of design thinking&lt;/a&gt; – ship early, ship often, iterate – can be applied to all aspects of open source education.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other thing we realized is that writing good notebooks is really hard: it requires the confluence  understanding the content (domain knowledge in comp neuro), programming, and radical empathy towards the learner (caring about androgogy). You also need an understanding of the house style,  context across days, and knowing the quirks of the Github CI. We needed a dedicated team to polish content, the waxers (we call them editors outside of NMA, but internally the name stuck). Waxers had to have the most stressful job of all, and I would often see messages exchanged on slack at 3-4 in the morning about content that needed to be ready for the next day. But it worked! The notebooks were a highlight of the NMA experience, and they will keep giving value to the community for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ella, Michael, Tara, Madineh and I presented our pipeline for the content in this talk:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jetpack-video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Making decisions under uncertainty&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How do you make decisions swiftly and effectively in a big org? We had hundreds of volunteers; &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/9fp4v/&quot;&gt;134 authors on the curriculum paper alone&lt;/a&gt;. 134 very smart people cannot all be of the same opinion at the same time in the face of uncertainty. The first step to make decisions effectively is to separate decision making and execution. It’s very easy to leave a lot of decisions to be implicit until it’s crunch time. It happened a couple of times that I made a medium-scale decision or encouraged other people to make medium-scale decisions during a daily standup meeting. Big mistake. A lot of people affected by the decisions weren’t in the room; they felt unheard and now burdened to go to a daily meeting to stay in the loop. Don’t do that – take bigger decisions in separate planning meetings. Every software methodology has some notion of a planning meeting, whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model&quot;&gt;waterfall&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)&quot;&gt;scrum&lt;/a&gt; or whatever – by the end of that meeting you should be clear about what to do for the next week or month. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One thing that can sap a lot of energy at these meetings is having circular arguments: revisiting the same question in subsequent meetings even though you thought you had come to an agreement. Sometimes, one person thinks a decision was made, while another thinks things were still under discussion. Write down decisions in meeting notes, share them with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some orgs in the for-profit sector are hierarchical, so that disagreements get resolved top-down. That doesn’t really work in the non-profit sector, where people are there on a volunteer basis. In non-profit and in open source communities, many orgs thus use consensus-based decision making. I think pure consensus-based decision making is very difficult to get right. I’m a member of a not-for-profit makerspace that’s built on anarchist principles. We use consensus-based decision-making, and it gets rowdy: flame wars on our message board are not infrequent, whether it’s about resource allocation and who gets the space when and whose responsibility it is to take the trash out. Pure consensus-based decision making can have an insidious effect that people that are not in agreement with the majority are left isolated as “difficult” and “not a team player”. That can breed resentment, which leads to personality clashes, which leads to dysfunction: decision making grinds to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s an alternative to pure consensus-based decision making: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit&quot;&gt;disagree and commit&lt;/a&gt;. You replace the norm that consensus must be reached with an alternative norm:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;everybody’s opinion should be understood &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;decisions are made based on majority or supermajority&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;it’s ok to disagree with a decision but we all bound ourselves to the decision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make sure that you understand somebody’s opinion – especially an opinion you don’t agree with –  you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://constantrenewal.com/steel-man/&quot;&gt;Steel Man technique&lt;/a&gt;. You restate the strongest version of their argument and engage with that. Oftentimes that will resolve whatever argument you had in the first place, or prepare you to build a hybrid solution. If you don’t come to a resolution, at least everyone will understand that they have been heard and understood. Decisions can take place in realtime in a synchronous meeting, or through a polling app in Slack (if a poll, put a deadline on it so it doesn’t drag on; in either case, quorum should be reached). If somebody disagreed with the decision, the norm says that that’s good and healthy, as long as they commit to the decision like everyone, so it doesn’t breed resentment in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Be the change you wish to see&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My manager at Facebook often talked about positive risk: if you shoot for the moon, sometimes you can actually overshoot and accomplish more than you intended. That always sounded like nonsense to me – &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law&quot;&gt;I’m a firm believer in Murphy’s law&lt;/a&gt; – but I had a chance to witness things going unexpectedly right at NMA. We planned many things, and delivered on what we planned, but perhaps our greatest success was fairly unexpected: pods worked. When we put students together with TAs, and had them interact closely for hours at a time in peer programming, they created bonds. Those bonds tapped into the students’ intrinsic motivation to be part of a community, and they felt belonging. When the going got tough, and they felt overwhelmed, they tapped into that support network to keep them going one more day. That’s how 87% of students managed to finish the class. One TA described the students tearing up on the last day and staying up till late in the morning to say goodbyes. Yes, materials are important, but in androgogy you also need to answer students’ emotional needs. That’s the biggest differentiator between NMA and a MOOC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building that experience required a ton of time from many dedicated and passionate people, people that wanted to make a difference. Sometimes emotions ran high and I butted heads – I can be a difficult person and that’s something I need to work on. Sometimes we had legitimate disagreements, but oftentimes we were just stressed and sleep-deprived, and we were able to apologize and move on. We were able to deliver a great experience, produce a new model for online learning, and we created bonds with each other that will follow us for a long time. Should you decide to embark on a expansive adventure like that? In the words of Edwin Land (stolen from Jack Gallant’s email signature):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t undertake a project unless it is manifestly important and nearly impossible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Edwin Land&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Drinking culture is a huge part of university, with Freshers’ Week events often revolving near-exclusively around getting drunk. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nus.org.uk/articles/new-survey-shows-trends-in-student-drinking&quot;&gt;2018 survey&lt;/a&gt; from the National Union of Students found that 76% of respondents feel an expectation for students to “drink to get drunk”; 79% agreed that “drinking and getting drunk” is a key part of university culture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t for everyone, however: a quick search of student forums will show many young people, pre-university, anxious about a drinking culture they don’t want to participate in. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjhp.12511&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Health Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, authored by Dominic Conroy from the University of East London and team, has taken a closer look at students’ decisions to reduce their alcohol consumption — and what prevents them from doing so.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41657&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were ten undergraduate students from the UK, all of whom had undergone a transition in their drinking habits, decreasing or stopping altogether. The students had different levels and patterns of drinking: some were light drinkers or completely teetotal, while others were more moderate drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The students took part in semi-structured interviews with one of the paper’s authors, responding to open-ended questions related to their drinking. Two “dilemmas” emerged from the participants’ responses: wanting to drink less but being concerned about social ramifications, and wanting to cut down but worrying about social confidence and missing out on fun.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Resolving the first dilemma — wanting to cut down but being concerned about social ramifications — was considered “important yet difficult to achieve” for participants: not drinking often came with an in-built assumption that the person was “uninterested in socialising” altogether. One participant described involving himself in drinking games during Freshers’ Week purely to build social connections: “I think it would have been more difficult to make friends if I was avoiding drinking completely,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For multiple participants, there was a desire to recognise the connections between early-term socialising and the potential for friendship in the years ahead; drinking during the early stages of university was often part of that process. This balancing act wasn’t always easy: one participant, Kelly, said that being open about her drinking preferences led to people “making [her] feel weird” and that her relationship with her flatmates was “quite difficult” because of it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second dilemma  —  missing out on fun and social confidence brought on by alcohol  —  was also resonant in participants’ accounts of university life. Alice told the team that “as a sober person, I’m so much more in control… sometimes I think I would enjoy myself more if I was pissed and less inhibited”, pinpointing alcohol as a source of fun, good memories, and uninhibitedness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other participants, more moderate drinkers who had cut down, experienced a similar yearning for the fun of alcohol  — but faced a further dilemma of trying to drink less than they had before or simply getting drunk as usual. Here, students felt trapped in a binary of either drinking a lot or drinking nothing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study had a small sample size and was not quantitative, so it’s hard to get an idea of how &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; students might be feeling this way or are being forced to compromise for the sake of their social lives. However, the insights from the conversations suggest a more complex picture of drinking at university than is sometimes understood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is a clear (and perhaps unsurprising) thread running through the findings that peer pressure or social norms are pushing students into drinking, or drinking more than one wants or intends to. One notable testimony suggested that there is little give-and-take on the part of students who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; drink, with those who drink very little being forced to compromise instead. Those who don’t drink also miss out on social connections and fear they are missing out on fun.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Paying attention to these two broad dilemmas, and the individual issues they encapsulate, may be a way of understanding the issues students face when it comes to drinking, drug-taking and peer pressure during university. The team notes that the students interviewed often (perhaps inadvertently) demonstrated a “sober curious” attitude to drinking, an approach that has taken off in the media over the last few years. Promoting such an approach, which rejects strict dichotomies, may be one way of helping students manage their drinking in a way that feels right for them, shifting norms around alcohol at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjhp.12511&quot;&gt;‘Maturing Out’ as dilemmatic: Transitions towards relatively light drinking practices among UK University students&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How do you know whether to trust what someone is telling you? There’s ongoing debate about which cues are reliable, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/10/20/decades-of-lie-detection-research-has-been-unrealistic/&quot;&gt;how good we are at recognising deception&lt;/a&gt;. But now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20649-4&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; reveals that we reliably take a particular pattern of speech pitch, loudness and duration as indicating either that the person lying or that they’re unsure of what they’re saying — and that we do it without even being aware of what we’re tuning into.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41646&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an initial study, Louise Goupil at Sorbonne University, France, and her team manipulated the pitch, loudness and duration of a series of spoken pseudo-words (which sounded like they could be real words in French, but were not). Twenty native French speakers then listened to these words and rated the speaker’s honesty and also their certainty (honesty and certainty were investigated in two separate trials with the same participants, held one week apart). The participants were also asked how confident they were in their judgements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team’s analysis revealed that a single “prosodic signature” — that is, the same pattern of volume, pitch, and speed — was associated with perceptions of both honesty and certainty. Loudness (especially at the beginning of the word), a lower pitch towards the end of the word, a less variable pitch overall, and a faster pace of speaking were all associated with more honesty/confidence. The opposite patterns were associated with less of either. The team also found that the participants were more confident when making judgements about the speaker’s certainty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, uncertainty and deception are not the same thing. A subsequent study involving two groups of 20 participants revealed that context — in this case, background information about what the speakers were purportedly doing when they uttered the pseudo-words — allows us to use the same vocal signature to make judgements about either honesty or confidence, depending on the situation. However, while there was widespread agreement when it came to judging confidence, the group was more split when judging honesty. While the data showed that the prosodic signature informed all their judgements, some of the participants decided that the speaker was faking an honest voice. This suggests that we rely heavily on sensory evidence in inferring a speaker’s level of confidence, but our judgements about whether they’re being truthful or not are more complex.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further questioning of this same group of participants revealed that though they did indeed rely on the three-factor prosodic signature in making their judgements, they were to a large extent unaware of just what they were tuning into. The team also studied additional participants whose native languages included English, Spanish, German, Marathi, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese — and found the same results. “Overall, these results demonstrate the language independence of a core prosodic signature that underlies both judgements of certainty and honesty,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that the prosodic signature is tied to signs of cognitive effort: someone who has to make more of an effort with what they’re saying — either because they aren’t very sure or because they’re lying — will take longer to say it, for example, and use less emphasis. That could explain why it is apparently not culture-dependent, but fundamental to all people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A follow-up study by the team did reveal that when participants heard words spoken with the prosodic signature of unreliability/dishonesty, these words “popped out” against effortless speech, grabbing the participants’ attention. So perhaps, starting in young childhood, we learn to spot these signs of cognitive effort, and learn to interpret them as indicating uncertainty or dishonesty. Alternatively, it might be part of a more ancient, innate system, shaped through evolutionary pressures to know whom to trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also found some gender differences in explicit judgements about whether people were lying/uncertain. For example, women were more likely to interpret certain/honest signatures as being faked. However, the data can’t reveal whether these differences were down to gender per se, or other related factors, such as anxiety or empathy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clearly, there are questions still to be answered. But it’s fascinating and, as the researchers write: “Our results add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that, contrary to decades of research arguing that humans are highly gullible, dedicated mechanisms actually allow us to detect unreliability in our social partners effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are some immediate practical implications, too. We evolved, of course, to interact face to face — and we can only use this prosodic signature when someone is talking to us, not if they are giving us information via a keyboard and screen. Whatever the benefits of this increasingly common way of interacting, the silencing of this particular method for spotting liars and hustlers is clearly a cost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20649-4&quot;&gt;Listeners’ perceptions of the certainty and honesty of a speaker are associated with a common prosodic signature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Our ongoing partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://protocols.io/&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt; led to a new and exciting &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE &lt;/em&gt;article type, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/what-we-publish#loc-lab-protocols&quot;&gt;Lab Protocols&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a new avenue to share research in-line with the principles of Open Science. This two-part article type gives authors the best of both platforms: protocols.io hosts the step-by-step methodology details while &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; publishes a companion article that contextualizes the study and orchestrates peer review of the material. The end result is transparent and reproducible research that can help accelerate scientific discovery. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Read our interview with protocols.io CEO and co-founder Dr. Lenny Teytelman where he discusses what triggered the concept for the company, how researchers can benefit from this collaboration and how his team settled on such an adorable racoon logo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For those who are unfamiliar, what is protocols.io? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is a platform for developing and sharing reproducible methods. It serves both researchers needing secure and private collaboration and those aiming to share their knowledge publicly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the inspiration behind protocols.io? Did you have any particular experiences or issues as a researcher that led to you believing protocol sharing was an under-supported element of the scientific community? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was a year and a half of my postdoc that went into correcting just a single step of the microscopy methods that I was using. Instead of a microliter of a chemical, the step needed five, and instead of a fifteen-minute incubation with it, it needed an hour. The problem is that this isn’t a new technique but is a correction of a previously-published method. That means I didn’t get any credit for that year and a half, and everyone using this method was either getting misleading results or had to spend one or two years rediscovering what I know—rediscovering what I’d love to share with them, but didn’t have a good way of doing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the experience that led to my obsession with creating a central place to facilitate the sharing of such knowledge, within research groups and companies and broadly with the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As authors of &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; began to share methods, we realized that all researchers and disciplines had a need for a dedicated tool for proper method sharing… We now warmly welcome methods from all fields and disciplines, including psychology, social sciences, clinical, chemistry, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;– Lenny Teytelman, CEO and co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://protocols.io&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protocols.io launched in 2014 — how were the first few years? How were you able to make yourself known and show that your product is worthwhile and secure for researchers? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oh, you just touched on a painful topic. I actually gave a talk at a conference in 2018, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKJwKXZsmi4&quot;&gt;The harsh lessons from 4 years of community building at protocols.io&lt;/a&gt;. The first years were surprisingly rough. As an academic with zero entrepreneurial experience, I naively expected that once we build the platform, I’d tell my scientist friends that it exists, and through word of mouth, it would go viral. Turns out that it is not how new initiatives work. There is a lot of dedicated work needed to build the trust and visibility and simply let researchers know that you exist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It took the support of publishers, societies, funders, and Open Science and reproducibility champions to climb out of obscurity. Speaking of that support, the 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2017/04/protocols-io-tools-for-reproducibility/&quot;&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; between PLOS and protocols.io was critical in helping the research community learn about protocols.io.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has the platform evolved since then? What elements have been consistent and what have been some major changes? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our vision and mission have not really changed since 2014, but thanks to the constant feedback of the research community and a brilliant CTO and co-founder Alexei Stoliartchouk listening to that input, the product has grown from a rudimentary website to a powerful tool with amazing functionality to support the sharing of the method details and to help in the daily work of the researcher. For a fun comparison of where we were at launch in February 2014, take a look at our Kickstarter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1881346585/protocolsio-life-sciences-protocol-repository&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the early changes was in scope, a year after we launched. We initially thought that this is a platform for experimental wetlab scientists, but soon after launch, requests started to come to expand it to support computational/bioinformatics workflows. And then in 2017, there was another expansion in scope, catalyzed by that same 2017 partnership with PLOS. As authors of &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; began to share methods, we realized that all researchers and disciplines needed a dedicated tool for proper method sharing. This actually led us to change our welcome page from “Repository for Life Science Methods” to “Repository for Research Methods.” We now warmly welcome methods from all fields and disciplines, including psychology, social sciences, clinical, chemistry, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important is the new PLOS ONE Lab Protocol article type to the journey and mission of protocols.io? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon after our launch, when I realized that things don’t just “go viral”, I began to think a lot about incentives. It occurred to me some time in 2015 that it would be amazing if researchers had a way of turning their protocols into peer reviewed papers. I was looking at the &lt;em&gt;F1000Research&lt;/em&gt; model and wondering if we could add peer review to protocols.io. The problem was that our scope was so broad, we would need thousands of academic editors to be able to support the peer review — essentially we’d have to build &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;. Then, in 2017 when we started working with PLOS, I realized, “We don’t have to build &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;! It already exists; we just need to partner!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while this partnership is a big deal for protocols.io, I am particularly excited about it because of what it can do for reproducibility and Open Science. As I said when we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stm-publishing.com/plos-announces-two-new-peer-reviewed-article-types-for-plos-one/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the launch, “We’re thrilled to extend our partnership with PLOS by launching this new modular article type. This will provide authors with all of the benefits of rigorous peer review, plus a dynamic and interactive platform to present their protocols, with support for videos and precise details that are important for adopting and building upon the published methods.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What type of research does not need to be as fast as possible? Do malaria or pediatric cancer patients somehow have the luxury of time? Can our planet afford delays in climate research? Open and rapid sharing as we see today for COVID-19 must be the norm, not an exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;– Lenny Teytelman, on the importance of Open Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS and protocols.io have similar mission statements and nearby offices: how did this collaboration with PLOS start? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many people assume that our collaboration with PLOS is a consequence of me being co-advised as a graduate student by Professor Michael Eisen, co-founder of PLOS. That actually is not the case. It is true that as soon as I realized in 2012 that something like protocols.io needs to be built, I called Professor Eisen, described the idea, and said, “PLOS should build such a platform.” But he replied, “PLOS is a publisher, not a software developer. You need to build it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So in fact, it is the Chief Science Officer of PLOS, Dr. Veronique Kiermer, who is the key early lead on the PLOS/protocols.io connection. Dr. Kiermer was the founding editor of &lt;em&gt;Nature Methods&lt;/em&gt; and has a passion for reproducibility and a deep appreciation for the essential role that protocols play in the research cycle. We met at an Open Access mixer in San Francisco when she had just moved to PLOS. As I showed her what we had built, she asked countless questions of “can it do this and that” and I showed her the “yes” answers right on my phone. She got excited and said, “This is exactly what I always dreamed of. We should do something together!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has the COVID-19 pandemic taught you about the importance of Open Science and supporting collaborative research opportunities? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ve been stunned by the extent of rapid sharing and collaborative spirit in the research world, united against the COVID-19 pandemic. It is how you ideally imagine science working. It is how science should work. We’ve seen a remarkable level of rapid method sharing in the SARS-CoV-2 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/coronavirus-method-development-community/publications?sort=views&quot;&gt;group&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s not just the methods; researchers are sharing data, preprints, code in precisely the way that accelerates and amplifies everyone’s efforts around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am simultaneously inspired by what I see and frustrated that this isn’t yet the norm. I’ve been watching the world and publishers declare in 2015 that rapid sharing and immediate Open Access are essential for Ebola research. Then the same in 2016 for Zika. Then 2019 for all research related to the opioid crisis. In 2020 and 2021 it’s COVID-19. It’s frustrating that we make exceptions for pandemics and crises and then go back to the traditional stunted way of sharing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What type of research does not need to be as fast as possible? Do malaria or pediatric cancer patients somehow have the luxury of time? Can our planet afford delays in climate research? Open and rapid sharing as we see today for COVID-19 must be the norm, not an exception.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next for protocols.io? (How can you continue to help scientists adopt Open Science activities?) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The beautiful part of our growth (we have over 9,000 public protocols now and have been roughly doubling every year since our launch), is that with increased sharing and researchers on protocols.io we also have received more feedback and requests than ever. As more requests and suggestions come in, our appetite for improving and enhancing the platform only increases. It’s kind of like with research itself – each answer leads to more questions and more thirst for experiments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are also genuinely excited about the &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; Lab Protocols and we look forward to the first papers being published and to the future developments in this partnership. We’re just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bonus Question: How did you decide on the cute raccoon logo? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The pen is mightier than the keyboard”… in other words, it’s better to take lecture notes with a pen and paper rather than a laptop. That was the hugely influential conclusion of &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797614524581&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; published in 2014, by Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer. The work was picked up by media around the world, and has received extensive academic attention; it’s been cited more than 1,100 times and, the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620965541&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, also in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, point out, it often features in discussions among educators about whether or not to ban laptops from classrooms. However, when Heather Urry at Tufts University, US, and her colleagues ran a direct replication of that original study, their findings told a different story. And it’s one that the team’s additional mini meta-analysis of other directly comparable replications supported: when later quizzed on the contents of a talk, participants who’d taken notes with a pen and paper did no better than those who’d used a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41640&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new replication, as in the original study, the 142 participants were all university students (this time at Tufts, rather than Princeton), who took notes while watching one of five roughly 15-minute-long TED talks. As before, there was then a roughly 30-minute delay during which they completed distractor tasks. After this, they completed a quiz on the facts and concepts presented in the talk.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the team analysed the data, they found that, as in the original study, participants who’d used a laptop to take notes recorded more words overall, and more verbatim phrases from the talk. Also as before, both groups performed equally well when it came to recalling the factual content of the talks. However, while Mueller and Oppenheimer found an advantage for longhand note-taking on the recall of concepts presented in the talks, Urry and her colleagues did not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the team’s efforts to replicate the original study as closely as possible, there were some differences between the two, however — including some that the researchers acknowledge could have affected the results. For example, more of the participants in the new study reported typically using taking class notes by hand. Also, in the original research, participants completed the study in a classroom, mostly in groups of two, and watched the talks on a screen at the front of the room. In this new research, about 80 of the participants completed the study outside of a class, and they viewed the talk on a laptop provided by the team. Many of these participants “noted that session were subject to distractions and errors,” the authors comment. This might have influenced the results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, this is of course only one replication. So the team identified a total of eight studies (including theirs and two from the original paper) that they felt were sufficiently similar to be directly compared. This mini meta-analysis produced also failed to find an advantage for longhand note-taking on conceptual recall. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Urry and her colleagues do accept that there were some limitations to all of these studies, including theirs. For example, TED talks are brief, and not hugely similar to typical university lectures; there are no pauses for extra note-taking or questions, for example. “Future studies should use approaches that better represent real-world settings,” the team recommends. Future studies should also consider new note-taking strategies (such as the use of styluses to write notes on a paper-like screen) as well as individual participants’ note-taking preferences. Also, there was only a 30-minute delay between watching the talk and being quizzed on it; this is not typical of real world university learning, either, so suggests caution in extrapolating from these results to likely impacts on actual students.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, given the influence of the original 2014 study, it’s important to note this failure to replicate, and the researchers’ cautionary conclusion: “Until future research determines whether and when note-taking media influence academic performance, we conclude that students and professors who are concerned about detrimental effects of computer note-taking on encoding information to be learned in lectures may not need to ditch the laptop just yet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620965541&quot;&gt;Don’t Ditch the Laptop Just Yet: A Direct Replication of Mueller and Oppenheimer’s (2014) Study 1 Plus Mini Meta-Analyses Across Similar Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 Observers describe the quantity of research information now produced variously as “torrent,” “overload,” “proliferation,” or the like. Technological advances in computing and telecommunication have helped us keep up, to an extent. But, I would argue, scholarly and journalistic ethics have not kept pace.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tolerance is often touted as a progressive value, a way of ensuring that society offers equal opportunities to all. But it can also imply “putting up with” something or someone you fundamentally disagree with or dislike — being tolerated isn’t the same as being genuinely valued or respected, for example. As one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-politics-of-toleration-in-modern-life&quot;&gt;writer&lt;/a&gt; puts it, tolerance has echoes “of at best grudging acceptance, and at worst ill-disguised hostility”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjop.12492?af=R&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the&lt;em&gt; British Journal of Psychology&lt;/em&gt; has found that the experience of being tolerated takes its toll on the wellbeing of ethnic minorities in the United States. Sara Cvetkovska from Utrecht University and colleagues find that the experience of being tolerated is closer to discrimination than it is to acceptance — impacting overall wellbeing and increasing negative mood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41625&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, the team looked at how wellbeing related to the experience of being tolerated, compared to being accepted or discriminated against outright. Participants were non-white, belonged to a racial or ethnic minority group, and ranged from 17 to 73 years old.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, participants answered questions about how frequently they felt they were being tolerated, accepted or discriminated against in several social contexts — at work, school, during leisure activities, at clubs or organisations, in their neighbourhood, on social media and overall. Tolerance was described as people objecting to particular cultural beliefs or practices but “putting up” with them nonetheless; discrimination referred to unjust treatment; while acceptance was described as a genuine appreciation for certain practices or ways of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants then rated themselves on five facets of wellbeing: positive and negative affect, self-esteem, life satisfaction and a sense of control. And while perceived acceptance, unsurprisingly, was associated with greater positive wellbeing, tolerance was associated with lower levels, with discrimination associated with the lowest levels of all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the second study, participants were asked the same questions about how often they felt they were being tolerated, discriminated against or accepted. This time, they also took part in a writing exercise, describing a particularly vivid instance of tolerance, discrimination or acceptance which they or someone they know had experienced. Participants then completed wellbeing measures as in the first study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once again, tolerance appeared to be an intermediate state for participants: wellbeing was higher in the tolerance condition than it was in the discrimination condition, but not as high as in the acceptance condition. But only positive and negative mood were affected by the writing task — more stable facets of wellbeing like self-esteem and perceived control were not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the final study, participants read that they worked at a company with a “casual Fridays” dress code. On one Friday they had come to work wearing a shirt with symbols reflecting their ethnic group: in the acceptance condition, their boss complimented them on the t-shirt and expressed interest in understanding its significance; in the tolerance condition the boss disapproved of the t-shirt but allowed it to be worn due to “freedom of expression”; and in the discrimination condition the boss actively banned the t-shirt from the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The participants then reported their positive and negative affect and how much the experience would threaten their identity — for example how negatively they felt about themselves or how powerless they thought they were. Again, tolerance was linked to greater wellbeing than discrimination but lower than acceptance. This time, people’s sense of identity was less threatened in the acceptance condition than in the tolerance condition. There was no significant difference between the discrimination and tolerance conditions in terms of social identity threat, however, suggesting the two, once again, are intimately linked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results suggest that “tolerance” may not be the best way of thinking about diversity. Though tolerance had less of a negative impact than discrimination, and while the two are distinct experiences, it was still linked to lower wellbeing than acceptance. This may be, as the team suggests, because tolerance shares the same negative appraisal of minority identity as discrimination — it’s just a bit more polite about it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future research could separate out responses somewhat: how an indigenous person experiences discrimination or tolerance is unlikely to be identical to the way a Black person would, for example. It would also be interesting to explore different kinds of relationships — in the final study, for example, the individual tolerating, accepting or discriminating was a boss. How would such behaviour impact wellbeing coming from a professional peer, another kind of authority figure, or even from a friend?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjop.12492?af=R&quot;&gt;Being tolerated: Implications for well‐being among ethnic minorities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;After my first Zoom meeting of the pandemic, I found myself lying on the bathroom floor with my noise-cancelling headphones on, on the verge of a full-blown meltdown. As an autistic person, I’ve always been hypersensitive to noise and to visual stimuli—but I hadn’t realized that a Zoom meeting with my colleagues could cause sensory overload. The number of images on the computer screen, the amount of movement in those tiny thumb-nail images, and the speed with which the images had moved, flashed, and changed—not to mention the obtrusive noise of malfunctioning microphones and noisy, socially-distanced households—had been enough to make me physically sick. Although many people tend to assume that an online event is automatically more accessible than an in-person event (after all, people can attend without leaving their homes), this isn’t always the case. Even when online events &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; more accessible, one of the lessons the pandemic has reminded me of is that the act of creating disability access can fundamentally change the nature of the thing that is accessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Creating access for people with disabilities sometimes means fundamentally changing the nature of the thing that is made accessible”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In writing my new book, &lt;em&gt;Shakespeare and Disability Studies&lt;/em&gt;, I was interested in exploring disability access as art and in exploring disability access as a complicated (and complicating) multifaceted phenomenon. Disability access is rarely just a question of “Can someone with X impairment use Y?” but rather more often a question of “If we modify Y so that someone with X impairment can use it, how does it change the meaning, the experience, and the effect of Y?” Creating access for people with disabilities sometimes means fundamentally changing the nature of the thing that is made accessible, whether the thing made accessible is a Shakespeare play (“the play’s the thing”) or a Zoom meeting. When we change the nature of the thing made accessible, we don’t just create access and inclusion for people with disabilities—we often create a new kind of experience altogether. I continue to be delighted and inspired by the innovative works, events, and objects we create (whether knowingly or inadvertently) when we create access for people with disabilities. Sometimes those new works, events, and objects bear a resemblance to the inaccessible version from which they grew. At other times, they do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most complex possibility, and the one most fundamentally counter-intuitive to a culture in which able-bodied and neurotypical (non-autistic) thinking are prioritized, is when creating accessibility not only fundamentally changes the nature of the thing made accessible but also causes attendees with a disability to lose something valuable. This seems counter-intuitive because stereotypical ways of thinking about disability have (falsely) taught us that disability experience does not include pleasure and that eliminating barriers to access is always an inherent and uncomplicated good. Neither of these things is true. For example, this year I’ll lead seminars at two Shakespeare conferences (the Shakespeare Association of America and the World Shakespeare Congress). Because of the pandemic, both conferences, for the first time ever, will be held completely online. However, these virtual events are more complicated for me than they originally seem, and their accessibility represents both gain and loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I continue to be delighted and inspired by the innovative works, events, and objects we create (whether knowingly or inadvertently) when we create access for people with disabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, both conferences will be more accessible for me in an online format. Traveling can be difficult for some autistic people (keeping in mind the effect of Zoom on my body and mind, imagine the effect of a crowded airport). I usually travel annually to the Shakespeare Association of America—but with much ado. I can’t fly alone (nor hope to navigate unfamiliar city streets or crowded hotels by myself) and so always travel with a support person. My support person is usually another Shakespearean, a kind volunteer who, after weathering the sensory travails of the airport and public transportation, will spend the conference with me. I am not independent. But also, I am never alone. Everything in my life is shared. There is a certain beauty in that. After a busy day of seminars and panels, I will lie on the hotel room bed in the fetal position, far too worn out from the crowds and the noise to do anything else, and my support person and I will gossip together with great pleasure about the intellectual goings-on of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disability, in our culture, is stereotyped as loss. Accessibility, in our culture, is deemed as always good, always a gain. It is also often misunderstood as simple and one-dimensional, as easy to understand and to explain. This year, for the first time ever, I will attend the Shakespeare Association of America without a support person. I will be independent. It is important, however, to think about the enormous cost of making the conference fully accessible to me. This act of access will fundamentally change the nature of what the conference is. The only way to make the conference fully accessible to me is for its social component, its travel component, its in-person component, to be completely removed. This represents a loss for all of the people at the conference and, ironically, also a loss for me. Because after my seminar at the 2021 Shakespeare Association of America, I won’t return to my hotel room to gossip about the intellectual goings-on of the conference with my support person. Rather, I will shut down my computer and reflect silently on the events of the conference… alone… for the first time in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have used virtual reality to explore how art and nature elicit feelings of the sublime. &lt;/strong&gt;The team compared people’s emotional responses when they saw a 360° VR version of Van Gogh’s &lt;em&gt;The Starry Night&lt;/em&gt; to when they saw a realistic portrayal of the actual area depicted in the painting. They found that both VR videos induced sublime feelings — but participants’ responses were more intense for the naturalistic video, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inverse.com/innovation/quantifying-the-sublime-with-vr&quot;&gt;reports Sarah Wells&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Inverse&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re often expected to fall firmly on one side or the other of an issue  —  but is there something to be said for embracing ambivalence? &lt;/strong&gt;Writing at &lt;em&gt;Psyche&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyche.co/ideas/the-fence-is-uncomfortable-but-it-affords-the-best-view&quot;&gt;Iris Schneider highlights&lt;/a&gt; the benefits of holding two opposing opinions simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on dolphin psychology this week: researchers have found that the marine creatures co-ordinate behaviour through vocal cues.&lt;/strong&gt; Dolphins appear to use clicks to synchronise their jumps, for instance, while in another study, two dolphins who had to press buttons simultaneously to get a treat used whistles to co-ordinate. But not everyone is convinced that these are examples of intentional communication, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/03/watch-dolphins-talk-each-other-synchronize-their-behaviors&quot;&gt;as Christa Lesté-Lasserre reports&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playing with ultra-thin dolls can leave young girls feeling they should be thinner themselves, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/playing-with-ultra-thin-dolls-could-make-girls-as-young-as-five-want-skinnier-bodies-156679&quot;&gt;writes researcher Lynda Boothroyd&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Boothroyd’s team gave girls aged between five and nine either ultra-thin dolls or more realistic, child-like dolls to play with. The former group showed lower body satisfaction and a thinner “ideal self” after playing with the dolls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve written a lot about lab-based trials of psychedelic drugs for treating mental health conditions &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; but now the first clinic to offer psychedelic-assisted treatment is about to open in the UK. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/mar/13/it-blew-my-mind-can-psychedelic-drugs-cure-addiction-depression&quot;&gt;Alexandra Jones has the story&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astronauts spending time in zero gravity could develop problems with emotion recognition, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/weightlessness-could-make-astronauts-worse-at-recognising-emotions-in-others/&quot;&gt;reports Sara Rigby&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;To simulate long periods of weightlessness, participants spent 60 days lying in a bed that was tilted down towards their heads. The participants became slower at recognising facial expressions and tended to categorise expressions as angry more than happy or neutral. But it’s not clear whether microgravity itself caused these changes, or whether they were the result of spending long periods in isolation and confinement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is psychology a form of secular mythology? &lt;/strong&gt;That’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/how-psychology-fills-the-gap-from-the-disenchantment-of-the-world&quot;&gt;argument made by Rami Gabriel&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Aeon&lt;/em&gt;. Psychology satisfies our need to understand why we are like we are, for instance, and gives us guidance about how to live our lives — much like religious texts or the myths of the ancient world.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger &lt;/em&gt;Dan Carney&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research into emotion processing in autistic people has mainly focused on how they understand others’ emotions. A more limited body of work into how autistic people process their own emotions has, however, suggested difficulties identifying and describing emotional experiences, and distinguishing between emotional states. The latter is potentially important, as it is associated with negative outcomes such as anxiety, depression, and self-injurious behavior, all of which have been suggested to occur more frequently in autism than in the general population.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, studies of emotion differentiation in autism have tended to use language-based tasks. But now, a team led by Eleanor Palser from the University of California San Francisco has reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1362361320987950&quot;&gt;the first study&lt;/a&gt; looking at how autistic children map out where they feel emotions in their body. The team finds that compared to non-autistic children, the bodily emotion maps of autistic children are more similar across different emotions, suggesting less variability in the way they physically experience different emotional states. The research, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Autism&lt;/em&gt;, was partly based on a 2016 report from the charity Autistica, in which members of the autistic community identified sensory processing and affective difficulties as key research goals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41592&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A key aspect of emotional experience is the bodily sensation and change brought about by different emotions (e.g. sweaty palms when nervous, heart pounding when excited). Researchers have &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/08/a-cartography-of-consciousness-researchers-map-where-subjective-feelings-are-located-in-the-body/&quot;&gt;created detailed bodily maps&lt;/a&gt; of the regions and sensations associated with different emotional states, but no one had directly studied how — and where — autistic people experience emotion in their bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the new study, the researchers asked autistic and non-autistic children and adolescents to produce body maps of various emotions using a pen-and-paper version of the emBODY emotion colouring task. The participants were asked to recall experiencing a particular emotion, then colour areas of stronger or faster resultant activity on one bodily outline, and those of weaker or slower activity on another. Six emotions — anger, fear, sadness, happiness, surprise, and disgust — were presented in a randomised order.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also used two tasks to measure interoception, one’s own awareness of internal bodily responses. &lt;em&gt;Interoceptive sensibility&lt;/em&gt;, participants’ perceptions of their own interoception abilities, was assessed by asking them to indicate how often they feel common bodily sensations (e.g. goose bumps or stomach noises). A more objective measure of &lt;em&gt;interoceptive accuracy&lt;/em&gt; was provided by examining how accurate participants were at a heartbeat-counting task.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the colouring task, autistic participants showed less variability across emotions, with regard to the head, heart, and hands. In other words, they were more likely than non-autistic participants to colour these areas similarly, regardless of the emotion they were recalling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-41597&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;41597&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;0&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;palser-et-al-2021&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/palser-et-al-2021.png?w=679&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/palser-et-al-2021.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/palser-et-al-2021.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;679,338&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/palser-et-al-2021/&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/palser-et-al-2021.png?w=679&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emotion maps produced by autistic and non-autistic children. Via &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1362361320987950&quot;&gt;Palser et al (2021)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly (and although the autistic group showed a lower level of interoceptive sensibility), these differences were not associated with interoceptive performance. This suggests that the bodily mapping task may tap into other aspects of emotion processing beyond simply the detection of one’s own physiological changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also speculate that the reduced emotion differentiation in the autistic group may — even on a relatively non-linguistic colouring task — still have been affected by the difficulties with emotion-based language that many autistic people experience, rather than interoceptive problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the fact that this task involved the recall of emotional events raises the possibility that episodic memory deficits may have played a role. The authors suggest that interventions focused on increasing children’s emotion word knowledge, or improving their memory of emotional events, may help to increase emotion differentiation. This is important because less variation in how people experience emotions has been linked to anxiety and depression, challenges which autistic people are more likely to experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, this study offers the first indication that some autistic people may experience less variation in their physiological emotional responses. Given that this may not be fully explained by interoceptive difficulties, future work could investigate other skills involved in distinguishing between the bodily sensations associated with different emotions. Studies could also examine these abilities in other populations, to establish to what extent patterns may differ between groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1362361320987950&quot;&gt;Reduced differentiation of emotion-associated bodily sensations in autism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Mohammad Hassan Tayarani Najaran will talk about a paper &quot;How to Exploit Fitness Landscape Properties of Timetabling Problem: A New Operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fitness landscape of the timetabling problems is analyzed in this
paper to provide some insight into the properties of the problem. The
analyses suggest that the good solutions are clustered in the search
space and there is a correlation between the fitness of a local
optimum and its distance to the best solution. Inspired by these
findings, a new operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms is
proposed which, during the search process, collects information about
the fitness landscape and tried to capture the backbone structure of
the landscape. The knowledge it has collected is used to guide the
search process towards a better region in the search space. The
proposed algorithm consists of two phases. The first phase uses a tabu
mechanism to collect information about the fitness landscape. In the
second phase, the collected data are processed to guide the algorithm
towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm clusters the
good solutions it has found in its previous search process. Then when
the population is converged and trapped in a local optimum, it is
divided into sub-populations and each sub-population is designated to
a cluster. The information in the database is then used to
reinitialize the q-individuals, so they represent better regions in
the search space. This way the population maintains diversity and by
capturing the fitness landscape structure, the algorithm is guided
towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm is compared
with some state-of-the-art algorithms from PATAT competition
conferences and experimental results are presented.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;On February 17, 2021, FTI Consulting released the report: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publishers.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FTI-Report-for-Publishers-Association-1.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Economic assessment of the impact of the new Open Access policy developed by UK Research and Innovation&lt;/a&gt;” (full title) prepared for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publishers.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Publisher’s Association&lt;/a&gt; (PA) of the UK.  While we are not setting out to provide an extensive review and analysis of this report, we do want to generally refute the assertion that OA via the UKRI policy is economically damaging, and we’ll provide some references that support this position.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Open Access and Open Research are an opportunity&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The FTI/PA report asserts that the impact of the new UKRI policy could lead to a loss in revenue to “UK-based journals” and have a broader negative impact on UK competitiveness, economic growth and position as a “global research hub.” This assessment appears to use impact on traditional publication models as the basis for this conclusion. A problem here, however, is that it is considering the scholarly publishing industry as somehow separate from the broader economic impact of making research open. Previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publishers.org.uk/publications/publishings-contribution-to-research-and-innovation/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reports &lt;/a&gt;from the PA itself have shown that the link to the economy is much broader than this depiction. The UK’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-research-and-development-roadmap/uk-research-and-development-roadmap&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;R&amp;amp;D roadmap&lt;/a&gt; clearly embraces open research and rapid open dissemination as not just good for science and health (especially during the current pandemic) but as a core part of “a world-leading system that unlocks innovation and growth throughout all parts of the economy.” Open Access enables this entire ecosystem to operate more efficiently and cost-effectively. When coupled with Open Research, it brings the additional benefits of &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1913039116&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increasing trust in science&lt;/a&gt;, ever more important during these difficult times. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Open Research (of which Open Access is one part) offers even greater opportunity both in terms of discovery and economic growth. For example, the European Data Portal’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.europeandataportal.eu/sites/default/files/the-economic-impact-of-open-data.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report &lt;/a&gt;on the economic impact of open data identifies the potential for 15.7% growth across a range of sectors – including scientific &amp;amp; technical, communication, transport, finance, health, retail and agriculture – and significant cost savings across the economy. We believe that a focus on Open Research, and all the efficiencies it brings, is worth considering for the UK economy especially in light of the combined impacts of the pandemic and Brexit (whatever one’s position on Brexit is).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Open Access is the fastest growing publishing model. A recent report from the scholarly analytics firm, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dimensions.ai/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dimensions&lt;/a&gt;, shows that “in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dimensions.ai/blog/open-access-surpasses-subscription-publication-globally-for-the-first-time/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2020 […]more outputs were published through Open Access channels than traditional subscription channels globally&lt;/a&gt;.” The report further show that the majority of the growth in OA is fueled by Gold OA, i.e. OA supported by some kind of business or sustainability model. It is ever more futile, in our opinion, to take such a critical and isolated position against UKRI policy when one can argue that OA is an outcome that will simply continue to happen. It is far more beneficial, as the policy itself proposes, to establish the UK as an early adopter, leader, and beneficiary of OA and its opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Publishers can and should lead&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The benefits of OA, the opportunities created by OA, and the desire for OA by the public and funders like UKRI, are clear. Contrary to Section 4.44 of the report, which mischaracterizes PLOS as publishing “at cost”, it is entirely possible to maintain value for authors, funders, and  institutions while operating a sustainable, surplus-generating business model. PLOS believes that publishers globally should be leading the efforts to devise and develop the next generation of business models that are able to support their operations in an Open Access context. This will, of course, require deep, and sometimes difficult, work by transitioning publishers. But we strongly believe this work is not outside the acceptable effort level of conscientious members of the scholarly publishing industry that have been aware of Open Access, and its benefits, for at least the last 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank the UKRI for its efforts to hear from stakeholders in the scholarly  publishing community, and beyond, regarding the proposed policy. We understand it is a discussion rife with passionate viewpoints and unseen complexities, and so we would like to ensure that one point is clear: to successfully set up the most efficient,  frictionless Open Access ecosystem, we should leverage the &lt;em&gt;existing &lt;/em&gt;budgets and infrastructures of scholarly publishing but with OA as the outcome. This way, Open Access is not viewed as a destructive force, or something external and different that traditional publishers are not part of, but simply as the new way to publish and communicate research that all publishers can facilitate. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hearing voices is often associated with mental illness. But this belief doesn’t always reflect reality, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioural-and-cognitive-psychotherapy/article/abs/hearing-voices-in-a-nonpsychiatric-population/1E67D977F6096FA5DBA2B84D0582C460&quot;&gt;much&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5240854/&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that many people who hear voices experience no distress and have never had contact with psychiatric services. &lt;em&gt;Religious&lt;/em&gt; hearing of voices also has a tradition outside of what we might consider “pathological”: St. Augustine’s recognition of the voice of God, to use one very famous example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why do some of us hear otherworldly voices, while others don’t? According to Stanford University’s Tanya Marie Luhrmann and team, it could be related to two factors: “absorption” and “porosity”, both of which concern our beliefs and experiences about how the mind interacts with the world. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/5/e2016649118&quot;&gt;In a study in &lt;em&gt;PNAS &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;that spanned a range of faiths and cultures, the team examined exactly how porosity and absorption can facilitate different kinds of spiritual experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41579&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Porosity” refers to the view that the boundary between the mind and the world is permeable — that emotions “linger in a room”, or that some people can read minds. Porous views tend to be contrasted with the more secular idea that the mind is a discrete space, separate from the world. “Absorption”, on the other hand, is the tendency to be engrossed in sensory or imagined events — being able to “lose yourself” in music, films, or nature, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at how these two factors were related to spiritual experiences among participants from the US, Ghana, Thailand, Vanuatu and China. Religions ranged from evangelical Christianity to Methodism to Buddhism to ancient practices found in Vanuatu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first study saw 300 adults with strong religious beliefs, either evangelical Christianity or a locally relevant religion, take part in two in-depth interviews conducted by on-site fieldworkers in churches, shrines and temples. One explored their experience of events in which they had felt a spiritual presence, and the other looked at how they understood and thought about the mind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the second interview, researchers probed belief in both porosity and absorption. Participants were presented with brief stories, each with different implications for the boundary between the mind and the world, and indicated how much they believed such an event could happen (e.g. the likelihood of someone becoming physically unwell because of a friend being angry with them). For absorption, participants indicated how much they agreed with statements such as “when I listen to music I can get so caught up in it that I don’t notice anything else”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second study replicated these methods with 766 adults from the general population in each country and 236 evangelical Christians, who were also asked how much they agreed with specific statements related to porosity (e.g. “spirits can read our thoughts and act on them even if we don’t speak them out loud”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interviews in both studies prompted stories about sensory experiences of otherworldly beings. Christian participants reported feeling the presence of god, whilst one Thai Buddhist participant, a nurse, told of an experience in which she calmly saw ghostly figures in the hospital where she worked. And while experiences differed across cultures, porosity and absorption were clear predictors of experiences of spiritual presence in different religions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the final study, 505 participants from each country, who were all based in cities, completed the two measures of porosity, the absorption scale, and the two measures of spiritual presence events used in previous studies. They also completed two measures of “secular” or non-spiritual hallucination-like experiences (responding to questions such as “I hear the telephone ring and find that I am mistaken”) and the paranormal (e.g. “I am completely convinced that it is [impossible/possible] to send a “mental message” to another person”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again, higher levels of absorption and porosity predicted experience of spiritual events. Interestingly, this was also the case for &lt;em&gt;secular&lt;/em&gt; events — hearing the phone ring, for example, or hearing music when it’s not being played — suggesting that porosity and absorption may have an impact on unusual sensory experiences even outside of religious contexts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results add further evidence for the need for openness around unusual sensory experiences. Both secular and religious experiences were recorded during the course of the study, with many participants not only unafraid but actively peaceful or calm, as in the example of the Thai Buddhist nurse. Christian participants also talked about the comforting presence of God.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that unusual sensory experiences are common even among those who do not suffer from mental illness. But perhaps studies like this, which broaden our understanding of the nature and frequency of unusual sensory experiences, could also help break down the stigma of disorders in which such experiences often occur.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/5/e2016649118&quot;&gt;Sensing the presence of gods and spirits across cultures and faiths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We all have times when we feel that we’ve failed — but it’s how we respond to it that really matters. Here are five findings that could help you cope with failure:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41571&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Be kind to yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s an old one, but a good one: practise some self-compassion. Being self-compassionate entails being kind and non-judgemental towards yourself in the face of difficulty — including failure. Perhaps the best-known &lt;a href=&quot;https://self-compassion.org&quot;&gt;proponent of self-compassion is Kristin Neff &lt;/a&gt;at the University of Texas, Austin (you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://self-compassion.org/test-how-self-compassionate-you-are/&quot;&gt;take her self-compassion test here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=&quot;https://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/publications/SClearninggoals.pdf&quot;&gt;Back in 2005&lt;/a&gt;, Neff published work finding that students who are self-compassionate in the wake of exam failure go on to study harder for future exams. More recent work has found that being kind to yourself if you feel that you’ve failed at something (and recognising that you’re far from alone in failing) is linked with better mental health. And self-compassion is even linked to greater physical health too, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-8183-1&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Resist “socially prescribed perfectionism”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you feel that other people expect you to be perfect, and will judge you harshly if you fail to meet their expectations, you experience this type of perfectionism. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735816302902?via=ihub&quot;&gt;major 2017 review&lt;/a&gt; of work into factors that foster resilience after failure or mistakes highlighted it as a clear risk factor: people who scored higher on this measure experienced more anxiety, depression and anger after being led to fail at a task. Interventions aimed at improving wellbeing and resilience should target this factor, the researchers concluded. Exactly how to go about this is another matter, of course. There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02703/full&quot;&gt;some evidence that exposure to contrasting messages&lt;/a&gt; — some anti-perfectionism, others in favour of it — helps to tackle this type of perfectionism. But for an individual, it could be worth resisting the urge to think about how other people might judge you after a failure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Don’t worry too much if you were over-confident — and wrong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overconfidence is not a good thing; it leads us to study less hard and make more mistakes. But let’s say you take an exam or test feeling convinced that you’re on top of the material and are getting pretty much everything right, only to receive a poor grade. Your initial confidence was clearly misplaced. No doubt, it was at least partly responsible for your failure. However, there’s plenty of evidence that the surer you are about an answer that turns out to be wrong and is corrected, the better you’ll remember the correct answer and use it in future. This, at least, was one of the conclusions of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-010416-044022&quot;&gt;a 2017 review&lt;/a&gt; of work on learning from errors by Janet Metcalfe at Columbia University. “A strong degree of belief in the truth of one’s errors makes them more, rather than less, susceptible to being correctable,” Metcalfe writes. However….&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Try not to take evidence of failure too personally&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619881133&quot;&gt;recent set of studies&lt;/a&gt; on almost 1,700 American participants, published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, found that feedback on what they had got wrong on a variety of tests or tasks rather than what they had got right — a “failure focus” rather than a “success focus” — undermined subsequent learning. (These participants’ confidence in their answers was not assessed.) Why? The researchers, at the University of Chicago, think that because personal failure feedback can threaten a person’s self-image, it leads them to tune out. However, participants did learn effectively from other people’s failures — when their ego concerns would have been “muted”. Perhaps encouraging people to reappraise feedback in less ego-threatening terms might help them to learn better from failure, the team suggests. However, as they also note, people in some countries — like Japan — persist for longer at a task after failing at it than after being successful, but this pattern is reversed for Americans. So culture clearly has a huge influence on the impact of failure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Embrace “productive failure”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea here is that instead of carefully teaching people how to do something, you let them loose on a new task with only the minimum of guidance. As Sunita G. Chowrira at the University of British Columbia and her colleagues explain in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-019-0040-6&quot;&gt;a recent paper&lt;/a&gt;, “While students often fail to produce satisfactory solutions (hence ‘Failure’), these attempts help learners encode key features and learn better from subsequent instruction (hence ‘Productive’).” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Productive failure has been found to have benefits in all kinds of teaching situations, including classrooms. In this particular study, Chowrira and her team divided first year biology students into two groups. One received standard instruction on various topics. The other group read a relevant chapter prior to the class, then embarked on challenges in small groups. They received feedback immediately afterwards, followed by instruction on any gaps in their understanding. This second group went on to do better at subsequent exams, and this was especially true for low-performing students. A productive failure approach “has the potential to transform large introductory university courses,” the team concluded. For an individual, there are lessons, too: those people who prefer to throw themselves at a new task rather than carefully reading the instructions first may well “fail” more (and anyone who’s ever tried this approach with a piece of flatpack furniture knows how bad that can be), but learn more and do better next time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EmmaELYoung&quot;&gt;@EmmaELYoung&lt;/a&gt;) is a staff writer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/&quot;&gt;BPS Research Digest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that political conservatives and liberals differ in fundamental ways — in their biology and neurology, personality and moral foundations — has received a good deal of attention. However, cracks have begun to appear in this idea. In 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/27/no-conservatives-dont-experience-feelings-of-disgust-any-more-than-liberals/&quot;&gt;we covered new work&lt;/a&gt; finding that conservatives are not in fact more readily disgusted than liberals (disgust has a moral dimension, of course). And the year before, Jesse Singal, a regular &lt;em&gt;Digest &lt;/em&gt;guest blogger, &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/07/how-social-science-might-be-misunderstanding-conservatives.html&quot;&gt;covered evidence suggesting that claims about liberal-conservative personality differences have been overblown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-82672-001&quot;&gt;major new review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of research into political orientation and moral foundations — essentially, how people view morality — calls into question some influential earlier conclusions. Writing in the &lt;em&gt;Psychological Bulletin, &lt;/em&gt;J. Matias Kivikangas at Aalto University and colleagues report finding support for the idea of some basic moral differences between conservatives and liberals. However, they also conclude that the differences are less clear cut than had been thought, and the results are also less generalisable across regions, countries and political cultures than has been claimed.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41565&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team considered study data from 89 samples, with 605 effect sizes. In total, these studies included almost 44,000 participants who had been directly recruited as well as around 193,000 participants who had chosen to complete surveys on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://yourmorals.org&quot;&gt;YourMorals.org&lt;/a&gt; website (widely used as a data source in this field). In each case, participants had rated their own political orientation on “liberal to conservative” or “left to right” scales, or on social or economic dimensions. They had also reported on their moral foundations using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-01014-001&quot;&gt;Moral Foundations Questionnaire&lt;/a&gt;. This questionnaire assesses the degree to which people prioritise five domains in moral decision-making: harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect and purity/sanctity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, the researchers looked at evidence for the influential idea that, compared with liberals, conservatives endorse the moral foundations of care and fairness less, and loyalty, authority and sanctity more. They found that this claim was generally upheld by the data. However, when they looked more closely, they found that conservative women were about as care-oriented as liberal women (it was conservative men who accounted for the link between conservatism and reduced endorsement of care as a moral foundation). Also, comparisons based on the YourMorals data produced around &lt;em&gt;double &lt;/em&gt;the effect sizes of studies that used independent samples. The team adds that “the consistency across the independent studies makes the estimates from the YourMorals dataset suspect”. People who choose to fill in surveys on this website probably do so because they are especially interested in the topic, are more open to experience (a personality trait associated more with liberalism than conservatism) and espouse more extreme beliefs than average — a self-selection that means their attitudes are not representative of the general population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also looked at the claim that moral differences between liberals and conservatives are universal, cutting across geography and culture. They found that this was not the case. In fact: “The association of moral foundations to political orientation varies culturally (between regions and countries) and subculturally (between White and Black respondents and in response to political interest).” For example, among subsamples of Black Americans taken from representative data sets, there was only a very weak association between conservatism and greater endorsement of sanctity and authority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also note that while conservatism is often viewed as one-dimensional in the US, in Western Europe, for example, it is generally thought of as having two dimensions: economic and  social. The team found that liberal/conservative variations in endorsement of care and fairness were more related to economic conservatism — and sanctity less so. Yet many studies use single “conservative-liberal” or “left-right” scales, which doesn’t allow for such nuanced conclusions. In fact, views on the meaning of “right-leaning” vary geographically, too; the team &lt;a href=&quot;https://ideas.repec.org/a/cup/bjposi/v49y2019i03p1045-1069_00.html&quot;&gt;cites a study&lt;/a&gt; finding that in many countries conservatism is more commonly associated with the left and liberalism with the right (something that they note is very clearly the case in Latvia and other formerly communist nations, for example).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In conclusion, the results of this meta-analysis both confirm and expand the relations of moral foundations and political orientation,” the team writes. However, they “also raise some notable considerations for future studies regarding the methodology and theory”.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">Update: Name change policy</title>
		<link href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/03/11/update-name-change-policy/"/>
		<id>https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/?p=905</id>
		<updated>2021-03-11T14:00:04+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">
 &lt;p&gt;arXiv is updating its name change policy to provide registered authors with more control over their online identities. This approach, which reduces barriers to changing public records, fosters diversity and reflects our inclusive ethos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv now offers the following name change options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In full text works: the author name can be changed in the PDF and/or LaTeX source where it appears in the author list, acknowledgments, and email address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In metadata: the name and email address can be changed in the author list metadata and in the submission history metadata for all existing versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In user accounts: the name, username, and email address can all be changed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not currently able to support name changes in references and citations of works. Also, arXiv cannot make changes to other services, including third party search and discovery tools that may display author lists for papers on arXiv. arXiv will continue to evaluate and adapt its policies as best practices evolve, and to allow users to directly manage their identity, while maintaining discoverability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv began discussing this issue in 2018 at the request of arXiv community members. We then consulted with arXiv’s advisory boards, in addition to librarians, publishers, and diversity experts. This latest update is an outgrowth of this work and reflects arXiv’s support for name changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv’s new policy aligns with guiding principles recently provided by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://publicationethics.org/news/update-cope-guidance-regarding-author-name-changes&quot;&gt;Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)&lt;/a&gt;, a global organization that aims to integrate ethical practices as a normal part of the publishing culture worldwide. The group expects to release more complete guidance on the issue later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to request a name change, please contact us &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/support/general_help&quot;&gt;through our user support portal&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:help@arxiv.org&quot;&gt;help@arxiv.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/11/children-as-young-as-8-show-a-gender-gap-in-negotiation/"/>
		<id>http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=41479</id>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/genderpaygapintheuk/2020&quot;&gt;gender pay gap is narrowing in the UK&lt;/a&gt;, it still remains. It’s vital, then, to fully understand what causes it — and so what can be done to ensure that women are paid the same as men for doing the same work. Research does show that women are less likely than men to initiate salary negotiations, and also ask for less. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620965544&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; reveals that a gender gap in negotiation emerges surprisingly early, becoming apparent among children aged just eight to nine. This implies that efforts to close the gender pay gap should start long before anyone even enters the workforce. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41479&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sophie Arnold at Boston College and Katherine McAuliffe at New York University studied 240 boys and girls who lived in the Boston area. The children fell into three age groups: 4 to 5, 6 to 7, and 8 to 9. They each completed a simple task, after which an experimenter — either a man or a woman — told them that they could pick from sets of stickers as a reward. Each child was asked: ‘How many stickers do you think you should get for completing the game you just played?’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the child asked for two or fewer, they were given this number. But if they asked for more than two, the experimenter told them that they were asking for too many and repeated the question. If the child again asked for more than two, they moved to the next negotiation stage. (Of the initial 240 children, 154 — equal numbers boys and girls — reached this stage.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this next stage, the kids were told that if they now asked for more stickers than the experimenter could give them, they wouldn’t get any; however, if they asked for the number of stickers that could be handed over, or fewer, they would receive that number. “These rules were introduced to reflect the risk inherent in negotiations, in which the evaluator has all the power to accept or reject an offer,” the researchers write. These children were then asked again how many stickers they thought they should get. If they asked for more than two they were told that only fewer than three stickers could be given. Whatever number they asked for next, the negotiation ended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Arnold and McAuliffe found that for 8 to 9 year old girls (but not the younger ones), the number of stickers that they initially asked for was lower if the evaluator was male than if the experimenter was female. For the boys, though, neither their age nor the gender of the evaluator affected their initial requests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also looked at how persistent the children were in asking for a relatively high number of stickers. “How long a person continues to ask for a greater bonus could also perpetuate gender differences in outcomes from negotiations,” the researchers note. In fact, they found a similar pattern: the persistence of the older girls (but not the boys) was lower when their evaluator was male. “Our study is the first to show that gender differences in negotiation emerge in childhood,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what might explain these early gender differences? It might be that the older girls have acquired the perception that they have a relatively low status, and the male investigator a higher status, the researchers suggest. &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/15/saying-that-girls-are-just-as-good-as-boys-at-maths-can-inadvertently-perpetuate-gender-stereotypes/&quot;&gt;Stereotypes that boys are naturally more brilliant and competent could also play a role&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Much attention has been devoted to explaining and closing the gender pay gap, yet these efforts focus almost exclusively on adults,” the researchers note. “Our findings suggest that these efforts should start earlier in development, as early as elementary school.” The next step, of course, is to map out what these efforts should entail, and testing how well they work. However, even if some gender differences in negotiation do help to explain the gender pay gap, other factors are certainly involved, and the onus should be not on employees, but rather employers, to ensure that it closes.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620965544&quot;&gt;Children Show a Gender Gap in Negotiation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/WKD-2021-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, 11 March 2021, &lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt; is celebrating World Kidney Day. This awareness campaign started in 2006 as a joint effort of the &lt;em&gt;International Society of Nephrology&lt;/em&gt; and the I&lt;em&gt;nternational Federation of Kidney Foundations&lt;/em&gt; with the goal of increasing awareness of kidney disease worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Themes over the years have highlighted the impact of risk factors of diabetes and obesity and focus on transplantation, and the health of women and children. This year, the theme will be the year of “Living Well with Kidney Disease” with the goal of patient empowerment and life participation. This is a striking reset in priorities. There has been a tremendous focus on outcomes as measured by lab values and hospitalizations rates with reimbursements affected positively or negatively when not meeting targets. Protocol developments by insurers and hospital systems and guidelines have reinforced the emphasis on data. This year’s theme reframes the care of individuals with kidney disease as improving outcomes to allow them to continue to participate in their lives. The theme also emphasizes that meeting laboratory targets and following protocols do not equate to fully taking care of the patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life participation is not something easily measured and cannot really be determined without the input of the patient. For some, it will be the ability to work, to participate in family activities, to vacation, or to control their symptoms. It puts patients and their caregivers at the center of their treatment plan and setting the goals of their care. To deliver this, healthcare providers will need to provide the education and support to empower patients and caregivers to be able to have a more active role and have discussions about what is important to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s World Kidney Day theme is a good reminder to all health providers that we are taking care of the individual not just treating a disease process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s World Kidney Day theme is a good reminder to all health providers that we are taking care of the individual not just treating a disease process. Hearing our patient’s concerns, challenges, and what they value should be part of our routine. Kidney disease for many is a life-changing diagnosis. While we cannot change the diagnosis of kidney disease, addressing the anxiety and frustrations many patients have will help their overall care. The initiative of living well with kidney disease serves to remind nephrology providers that kidney disease is part of the patient’s life but should not be their entire life.  I would take this further that this may be a reminder for all of us taking care of individuals with a variety of health conditions. We need to take care of the individual, not just the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Author: Chris Haumesser, Director of Platform and Engineering at PLOS&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding the impact of research is of vital importance to science. The altmetrics  movement is &lt;a href=&quot;http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;defined&lt;/a&gt; by its belief that research impact is best measured by diverse real time data about how a research artifact is being used and discussed. These metrics serve as “alternatives” to solely relying  on traditional shorthand assessments like citation counts and Journal Impact Factor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS was an early adopter and advocate of these metrics, with its internally-developed Article Level Metrics (ALM) platform among the earliest implementations to launch in 2009. By displaying data from multiple sources, PLOS ALM showed how an article was being read, downloaded, cited, discussed and shared, accessible from the article itself by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In its decade of service to the PLOS community, ALM has helped blaze a trail for others to follow. Today altmetrics are so commonly taken for granted that the “alternative” moniker seems anachronistic – the ubiquity of these metrics a testament to the return on our investment in ALM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, the altmetrics movement has been so successful that it has spawned a market of providers who specialize in collecting and curating metrics and metadata about how research outputs are used and discussed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of these services, in particular, has far outpaced the reach and capabilities of ALM, and PLOS is now excited to pass the baton of our altmetrics operations to the experts at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altmetric.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Altmetric&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the historical significance of ALM, it’s not an easy decision to say goodbye. But PLOS is as committed as ever to providing our community with the best possible data about how their research is changing the world. Altmetric’s singular focus on research metrics positions them to deliver on this promise with a breadth and depth that PLOS simply can’t match as an organization with competing priorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Partnering with Altmetric will unlock data from many sources beyond ALM that were previously untracked. After an extensive analysis, PLOS is confident that Altmetric will provide increased coverage across the board for the vast majority of papers in our corpus. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beginning today, the data displayed on the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/metrics?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223447&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Metrics&lt;/a&gt;” tab of our published articles will all come from Altmetric, and the “Media Coverage” tab of our published articles will link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.altmetric.com/details/67678982/news&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Altmetric’s media coverage&lt;/a&gt;. Each article will also have a link to an Altmetric &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.altmetric.com/details/67678982&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;details page&lt;/a&gt;, which displays extensive detailed metrics for the article. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As part of this transition, authors may see their metrics change due to the change in data provider. We expect authors to see some metrics increase due to Altmetric’s increased coverage and new sources. However, we are retiring some areas of our metrics provision entirely.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether you believe in such a thing as “pure evil” — that there are individuals inherently predisposed to intentionally harming others — can fundamentally change how you see the world. Strong belief in pure evil, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/08/15/things-you-might-want-to-know-about-people-who-believe-in-pure-evil/&quot;&gt;has been linked to&lt;/a&gt; increased support for the death penalty, torture, and racial prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acp.3795?af=R?saml_referrer&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Applied Cognitive Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, has looked at the link between belief in pure evil and the attributes we ascribe to perpetrators of violence. Focusing on mass shootings in the US, the team once again finds a relationship between belief in pure evil and harsher approaches to punishment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41513&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomly assigned to read one of four articles from &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;, all of which they believed were real, about a mass shooting at a shopping mall. Two of these articles mentioned that the shooter had a brain tumour, and contained a fictitious quote from a neuroscientist explaining how the tumour may have affected the shooter’s behaviour. The other two noted that the perpetrator’s brain scan looked normal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The articles also differed in how the shooter’s behaviour and traits were described. In the “stereotypically evil” condition, the shooter stated that they had enjoyed the act, while a quote from a security guard described the perpetrator as “smiling, smug… like he got some thrill out of doing it”. In the “non-stereotypically evil” condition the security guard described the shooter as seeming “distressed” by his actions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After reading the article, participants wrote a small passage explaining why they felt the shooter had perpetrated his crimes. They then rated how confident they were that his actions were caused by his personality, or by environmental factors; that he was in control; that his actions were deliberate; and that he should be blamed or held responsible for his actions. Participants also completed a measure of dehumanisation (responding to statements like “The perpetrator is emotionless”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They then provided their recommendation for different types of punishment (e.g. community service or the death penalty), and indicated how long they felt the perpetrator should be in prison for, or whether or not they should be executed. Finally, participants completed a scale measuring their belief in pure evil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with higher levels of belief in pure evil were far more confident about the reasons for the shooter’s actions, and were more likely to attribute his behaviour to his personality. These participants were also more likely to advocate for harsher punishments, up to and including the death penalty. The analysis also suggested that those who believed in pure evil punished the perpetrator more &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they felt he was personally liable, because they had dehumanised him, and because they felt greater levels of retribution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, participants in the stereotypically evil condition were also more likely to ascribe the act of violence to personality than to environmental factors. Those who read that the shooter had a tumour, on the other hand, advocated for lower levels of punishment and were less likely to blame personal factors. However, people who believed in pure evil tended to support harsh punishment whether or not they read that the perpetrator had a tumour, suggesting that believers in pure evil are generally unmoved by these sorts of considerations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team notes that the direction of causality between belief in pure evil and retribution is unclear — that is, we may have developed and bought into the idea of pure evil to justify our inherently retributive instincts rather than the other way around. It would also be interesting to explore narratives about pure evil in the realms of media and politics. Cultural differences could change the relationship between beliefs and punishment: in countries where politicians frequently invoke severe punishments or tend to ignore environmental factors in crime, for example, is there a generally higher level of belief in pure evil than in those areas where this isn’t the case? Future research could probe this further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12303&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/bottles-4840001_1920-300x169.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Alcohol consumption and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/alcohol-support/the-risks-of-drinking-too-much/&quot;&gt;its associated consequences&lt;/a&gt;, including cancers and heart disease, remain to be a major public health challenge. Investigating the factors that contribute to alcohol consumption can help determine where to target intervention resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors found strong associations between occupations and heavy alcohol consumption&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Liverpool, Thompson and Pirmohamed, investigated the association between occupation and heavy alcohol consumption in working individuals aged 40-69 years in the UK. Thompson and Pirmohamed used the UK Biobank to recruit participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found strong associations between occupations and heavy alcohol consumption, with jobs identified as skilled trades the most likely to be associated with heavy alcohol consumption. The largest ratios for heavy drinkers were observed for publicans and managers of licensed premises, industrial cleaning process occupations, and plasterers. Whereas clergy, physicists, geologists and meteorologists and medical practitioners were least likely to be heavy drinkers. The authors findings help to determine which employment sectors may benefit most from health promotion programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Anesthesiology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;c-article-title&quot; data-test=&quot;article-title&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcanesthesiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12871-021-01286-w?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020&quot;&gt;A gap existed between physicians’ perceptions and performance of pain, agitation-sedation and delirium assessments in Chinese intensive care units&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This highlights the need for prompt quality improvement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain, agitation-sedation and delirium (PAD) management are key elements in the care of critically ill patients. However, previous research has highlighted the gap between actual clinical practices and physicians’ attitudes to PAD management. Zhou &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; investigated the current practice of PAD assessments in Chinese ICUs by a one-day point prevalence study combined with an on-site questionnaire survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12308&quot; style=&quot;width: 341px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12308&quot; height=&quot;158&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/Capture2-300x143.png&quot; width=&quot;331&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Fig. 5 taken from Zhou et al.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors concluded that the actual PAD assessment rate was suboptimal, especially with regards to delirium screening. There was a significant gap between the actual practice and the physicians’ perception of the practice. Physicians reported performing assessing pain and agitation-sedation in approximately only 20 to 25% of patients which is lower than previous reports. Therefore, the study highlights the need for prompt quality improvement and the optimization of practices of PAD management in ICUs in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders have sleep disturbance and this impacts their quality of life. However, it is not yet fully understood how sleep disturbance affects the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia (FD). Kuribayashi &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; carried out a prospective study on 20 patients to investigate the relationship between FD and sleep disturbance. Patients took sleep aids for 4 weeks and filled out questionnaires before and after taking sleep aids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disturbance was significantly improved by 4-week administration of sleep aids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that sleep disturbance was significantly improved by 4-week administration of sleep aids and as a result, GI symptoms, anxiety, and quality of life in patients with FD were also improved. In addition, the authors concluded that the use of sleep-inducing drugs was associated with reduced pain as well as improvement of dyspeptic symptoms in FD patients. Overall the study highlights the potential benefits of sleep aids for patients with FD and sleep disturbance, although multicenter studies involving a larger number of cases are needed to further investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12305 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;254&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/jogging-2343558_1920-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;381&quot; /&gt;Previous research has reported that many muscles of the trunk and lower limb were greater in sprinters than in non-sprinters. However, the specific muscles that contribute to superior sprint performance for sprinters have not been fully identified. Suga &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;examined the relationships between the trunk and lower limb muscle cross-sectional areas and sprint performance in well-trained male sprinters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings showed that larger absolute and relative cross-sectional areas of the psoas major and gluteus maximus correlated with better personal best 100m sprint times. Therefore, the psoas major and gluteus maximus may be specific muscles for superior sprint performance for sprinters. The study also corroborates previous studies suggesting that the hamstring may not be an important muscle for achieving superior sprint performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/health-topics/cervical-cancer#tab=tab_1&quot;&gt;Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women&lt;/a&gt; globally and cytology-based (Pap smear) screening is important for early detection and treatment. Although cervical cancer screening is beneficial and can enable early detection, a positive screening result might cause psychological burden. As a result, this may influence the decision to undergo further examination and future screening for cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychological distress appeared to be higher in the control group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaka &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; carried out a randomized control trial in Japan, with the intervention being the provision of cervical cancer information and cervical cancer screening information through a leaflet. The authors aim was to evaluate whether the leaflet would help reduce psychological distress. Women who were about to undergo cervical cancer screening received hypothetical screening results either with or without a leaflet, at random. Following the intervention, psychological distress appeared to be higher in the control group than in the intervention group among those who received a hypothetical positive screening result. Therefore, the authors concluded that information provision might help reduce psychological distress and recommend that cervical cancer screening programs provide participants with all relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you’ve done something wrong, big or small, it can be hard to own up to it — particularly if you feel you’ve transgressed a moral or social code. Instead, you might avoid confronting the issue and become defensive. Yet defensiveness often has negative consequences anyway: it can hurt someone else’s feelings, cloud your ability to make a good decision in the moment, or prevent you from changing harmful behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; do we get defensive, and what can we do to minimise those negative consequences? A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjso.12378&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; from Michael Wenzel and colleagues at Flinders University, published in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Social Psychology, &lt;/em&gt;asks both of these questions — and finds that defensiveness could be reduced by affirming people’s moral and social worth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41474&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 187 participants were asked to recall an incident in which they had wronged somebody else, writing a brief description of what they had done. They then rated how severe the transgression was, the importance of their relationship with the person they had wronged, how guilty they felt and how much they accepted blame (e.g. “I wasn’t the one to blame for what happened”), and how loved and accepted they felt despite any wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants then took part in an implicit guilt test, a version of the (&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/05/psychologys-favourite-tool-for-measuring-implicit-bias-is-still-mired-in-controversy/&quot;&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt;) Implicit Association Test. This essentially looked at how quick participants were to categorise self-related words (e.g. “me”) when they also had to press the same key to categorise guilt-related words (e.g. “blame”) versus when they had to press the same key to categorise innocence-related words (e.g. “virtue”). If they were faster for the former, this was taken as an implicit association of the self with guilt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results suggested that those participants who felt a higher need for belonging were more likely to engage in defensiveness: the more “implicit” guilt they showed on the test, the less likely they were to assert that they were to blame for the incident they outlined. Those who felt socially accepted, on the other hand, were more likely to express explicit guilt as their level of implicit guilt increased.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the second study, omnivorous participants were shown a short video about cruelty within the egg and meat industry before speaking to a bot, which either affirmed or denigrated their choice to eat meat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Watching the video on animal cruelty led to greater guilt and concerns about moral or social transgression — but only when there was no opportunity to have that guilt assuaged through the online chat. Those participants who &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; received reassurance from the bot about eating meat were also more likely to explicitly express guilt that reflected their levels of implicit guilt. Those who had not received reassurance saw a greater disconnect between implicit and explicit guilt, suggesting a level of defensiveness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants who had received reassurance from the bot were also more likely to donate to an animal rights organisation, while those who had not were less likely to donate the more implicit guilt they indicated. This, the team says, suggests that threats to acceptance can lead not only to increased defensiveness but also an unwillingness to repair harm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As noted, the Implicit Association Test has faced serious scrutiny over the last few years, with some critics suggesting that the test may not be truly indicative of real-life thoughts or behaviours. The team also acknowledges that the relationship between implicit and explicit guilt may not be as straightforward as the results suggest — defensiveness may be so effective a psychological process, they write, that it may reduce or even eliminate implicit evaluations or admissions of responsibility and guilt. In other words, defensiveness may not only be an external avoidance of blame but an internal one, which individuals are not aware of themselves. External admissions of guilt may also be unreflective of true or implicit feelings of guilt — someone might profusely apologise for reasons that are more to do with social pressure than real feeling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the results suggest a key element of defensiveness is a feeling of moral or social threat. Where individuals are given affirmation, defensiveness decreases — and more efforts are made to repair harm. It may be difficult to give someone such reassurance, particularly when you’re the one they’ve harmed — but it could also be the best way of helping them truly engage with what they’ve done.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjso.12378&quot;&gt;The effects of moral/social identity threats and affirmations on psychological defensiveness following wrongdoing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;Imagine you are the victim of an unfortunate accident. A car crash, perhaps, or a fall down the stairs. After some time, you regain awareness. Sounds return, smells greet your nostrils, textures kiss your skin. Unable to move or speak, you lie helpless in your hospital bed. How would anyone know that you—your thoughts, feelings, and experiences—are still there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors might look at your brainwave activity, as measured by an EEG device, to see if anyone’s home. What frequencies of activity does your brain produce? One brain rhythm your doctor might look for is called “delta.” This slow activity, one to four cycles per second, generally tells us that the cerebral cortex is offline and that the mind is plunged into unconsciousness. It is seen in dreamless sleep and under anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta activity might suggest to your doctor that no one is home, that you have no more awareness or feeling than someone in a dreamless sleep. But this assumption may be wrong. My recent research with Angelman syndrome, a rare disorder caused by dysfunction of the gene &lt;em&gt;UBE3A&lt;/em&gt;, shows that children with this disorder who are unambiguously awake and conscious still show massive delta activity in their EEGs. These children have delayed development, intellectual disability, and often seizures. Some of them cannot communicate without gestures or special devices. But they can clearly feed themselves, play with other children, respond to environmental cues, and follow simple commands from their parents. In other words, there’s no question that they are conscious. So why are their brains generating delta activity, a signature of unconsciousness, while they are wide awake?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer is, nobody knows. But studying these children may be key to developing better biomarkers of consciousness that can be used to determine whether unresponsive brain-injured patients are &lt;em&gt;covertly conscious&lt;/em&gt;—that is, conscious without the accompanying behaviors that usually tell us that someone is conscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides delta activity, another EEG feature that relates to consciousness is the complexity of the EEG signal. This can be measured in various ways, such as looking for reoccurring patterns in the EEG signal or measuring how difficult the signal is to compress (on your computer, think about zipping an image of a Vermeer painting—complex—versus zipping an image of a Rothko painting—simple). We already know EEG complexity is diminished during &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2017/1/niw022/2957408?login=true&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dreamless sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=966601&amp;amp;casa_token=7ixFsh58VGQAAAAA:5xKlUrUBF8jx-HjWoTXN2dexFe6Rzp-w__6J6dlSCwc6JueFY_3hPZh55AOEdVpkZ2aFBl7bIWY&amp;amp;tag=1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;anesthesia&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, it is also &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46421&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increased by psychedelic drugs&lt;/a&gt; that induce hallucinations. But in Angelman syndrome, where the rules of delta seem not to apply, will EEG complexity still track consciousness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and collaborating institutions set out &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2020/1/niaa005/5857332?searchresult=1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;to test this hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; using EEGs recorded from 35 children with Angelman syndrome during both wakefulness and sleep. First, we asked whether the power of delta activity would change when the children fell asleep and, second, whether the EEG complexity would change when the children fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we already expected, delta activity appeared very strong both when children with Angelman syndrome were awake and asleep. However, a thin slice of the delta spectrum was modulated by sleep. Specifically, the delta waves between one and two cycles per second were enhanced when the children napped. Delta waves between two and four cycles per second, on the other hand, did not show much modulation, as this portion of the delta spectrum appears to mostly reflect abnormalities in Angelman syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about the EEG complexity? As it turns out, this biomarker of consciousness passed the Angelman syndrome test with flying colors. Both measures of EEG complexity based on reoccurring patterns and compression were greatly diminished when the children napped. While EEG activity is rich and varied when children with Angelman syndrome are awake, it becomes repetitive and predictable when they are asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of this experiment are highly encouraging: we can use EEG signal complexity to track consciousness, even under circumstances where brain activity is highly abnormal. Of course, children with Angelman syndrome look very different from the patient who you imagined yourself as at the beginning of this post. But the bottom line is that we may never find universal biomarkers of consciousness by only studying healthy brains. Looking at many different brains—those that are healthy and those that are affected by various diseases—and searching for universal patterns is a better strategy, one that is more likely to translate to severely brain-injured patients in the intensive care units of hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the overwhelming evidence relating EEG signal complexity to consciousness, I believe this metric will likely be used in clinics in the near future to measure patients’ level of consciousness. However, some debate still exists regarding the best context for taking these measurements. Is it better to look at the EEG complexity in response to magnetic brain stimulation, thus revealing the brain’s capacity to respond to a gentle “push”? Or it is better to look at the spontaneous EEG complexity, when the brain is minding its own business, so to speak? In our study, we took the latter approach, which is certainly easier in young children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the former approach, which uses a coil of wire held above the head to stimulate the brain noninvasively, has accumulated very strong evidence in the past decade as a nearly perfect measure of conscious state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above technique, called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/5/198/198ra105/tab-pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;perturbational complexity index&lt;/a&gt; or PCI, has never been studied in Angelman syndrome. We do not know yet whether the abnormal brain dynamics seen in children with Angelman syndrome would trick PCI into giving a false negative result (that the children are unconscious when they are in fact awake and conscious), or if PCI would ace the test. But there is only one way to find out. The next step in this research will be to test PCI in children with Angelman syndrome. If it succeeds, then we are one step closer to building a “consciousness detector” for clinical use. If not, then back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abstract for the talk is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large-scale numerical simulations of brain circuit models are important for identifying hypotheses on brain functions and testing their consistency and plausibility.
Similarly, spiking neural networks are also gaining traction in machine learning with the promise that neuromorphic hardware will eventually make them much more energy efficient than classical ANNs.
In this dev session, we will present the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt;-enhanced Neuronal Networks) framework [1], which aims to facilitate the use of graphics accelerators for computational models of large-scale spiking neuronal networks to address the challenge of efficient simulations.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; is an open source library that generates code to accelerate the execution of network simulations on &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NVIDIA&lt;/span&gt; GPUs through a flexible and extensible interface, which does not require in-depth technical knowledge from the users.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; was originally developed as a pure C++ and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/technologies/cuda/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUDA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; library but, subsequently, we have added a Python interface and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.khronos.org/opencl/&quot;&gt;OpenCL&lt;/a&gt; backend.
The Python interface has enabled us to develop a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/&quot;&gt;PyNN&lt;/a&gt; [2] frontend and we are also working on a Keras-inspired frontend for spike-based machine learning [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the session we will briefly cover the history and basic philosophy of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://genn-team.github.io/genn/&quot;&gt;GeNN&lt;/a&gt; and show some simple examples of how it is used and how it works inside.
We will then talk in more depth about its development with a focus on testing for &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt; dependent software and some of the further developments such as Brian2GeNN [4].&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session David Haydock will talk about a paper &quot;Spatiotemporal Dynamics of the Brain at Rest Exploring EEG Microstates as Electrophysiological Signatures of BOLD Resting State Networks&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging research suggests that the resting cerebral physiology is
characterized by complex patterns of neuronal activity in widely distributed
functional networks. As studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) of the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal, the resting
brain activity is associated with slowly fluctuating hemodynamic signals (10
s). More recently, multimodal functional imaging studies involving simultaneous
acquisition of BOLD-fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG) data have suggested
that the relatively slow hemodynamic fluctuations of some resting state
networks (RSNs) evinced in the BOLD data are related to much faster (100 ms)
transient brain states reflected in EEG signals, that are referred to as
&quot;microstates&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further elucidate the relationship between microstates and RSNs, we
developed a fully data-driven ap- proach that combines information from
simultaneously recorded, high-density EEG and BOLD-fMRI data. Using independent
component analysis (ICA) of the combined EEG and fMRI data, we identified
thirteen mi- crostates and ten RSNs that are organized independently in their
temporal and spatial characteristics, respec- tively. We hypothesized that the
intrinsic brain networks that are active at rest would be reflected in both the
EEG data and the fMRI data. To test this hypothesis, the rapid fluctuations
associated with each microstate were correlated with the BOLD-fMRI signal
associated with each RSN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that each RSN was characterized further by a specific
electrophysiological signature involving from one to a combination of several
microstates. Moreover, by comparing the time course of EEG microstates to that
of the whole-brain BOLD signal, on a multi-subject group level, we unraveled
for the first time a set of microstate-associated networks that correspond to a
range of previously described RSNs, including visual, sensorimotor, auditory,
attention, frontal, visceromotor and default mode networks. These results
extend our understanding of the electrophysiological signature of BOLD RSNs and
demonstrate the intrinsic connec- tion between the fast neuronal activity and
slow hemodynamic fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Author: Veronique Kiermer, Chief Scientific Officer&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to announce the creation of the PLOS &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/about/scientific-advisory-council&quot;&gt;Scientific Advisory Council&lt;/a&gt;, a small group of active researchers with diverse perspectives to help us shape our efforts to promote Open Science, globally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS, as a non-profit organization committed to empowering researchers to change research communication, cannot successfully pursue its mission without listening to the research community. We regularly survey and consult the research communities we work with, formally and informally, to guide our choices and developments. The organization’s governance, including our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/about/board-of-directors/&quot;&gt;Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, has always involved active researchers. And we derive great insight and advice from our continuous exchange with the academic Editors of PLOS journals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve decided to take an additional formal step and create a forum where the researchers who contribute to PLOS through different channels can interact directly with each other, and to ensure that this forum includes voices from researchers around the globe. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve created the PLOS Scientific Advisory Council, a small group of researchers who represent varied scientific and career perspectives, who will advise PLOS executive and editorial leadership on strategic questions of scientific interest. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this point, the Scientific Advisory Council is deliberately small–about a dozen individuals–to ensure in-depth discussions and engagement, but we’ve strived to include different disciplinary interests, career stages and geographic representation. The group includes four PLOS Board members who are themselves active researchers, two of our journals’ academic Editors-in-Chief, alongside researchers who are not formally associated with PLOS. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to welcome the following members to the PLOS Scientific Advisory Council. To see their photos and full bios, please visit their &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/about/scientific-advisory-council&quot;&gt;page &lt;/a&gt;on our website: &lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2021-03-01T07:11:10+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/usa-1120579_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol and firearms are a dangerous combination and are commonly involved in suicide in the United States. This has only increased in importance as a public health issue as alcohol drinking, firearm sales, and suicides in the United States have all increased since the start of the covid-19 pandemic. State alcohol policies and state firearm policies might impact alcohol and firearm related suicide, but it is unknown how these policies specifically relate to these suicides, or how these policies might interact with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess relationships between alcohol policies, firearm policies, and U.S. suicides in 2015 involving alcohol, firearms, or both. We used the Alcohol Policy Scale, previously created and validated by our team, to assess alcohol policies and the Gun Law Scorecard from Giffords Law Center to quantify firearm policies. Suicide data came from the National Violent Death Reporting System. State- and individual-level GEE Poisson and logistic regression models assessed relationships between policies and firearm- and/or alcohol-involved suicides with a 1-year lag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher alcohol and gun law scores were associated with reduced incidence rates and odds of suicides involving either alcohol or firearms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States in 2015, alcohol and/or firearms were involved in 63.9% of suicides. Higher alcohol and gun law scores were associated with reduced incidence rates and odds of suicides involving either alcohol or firearms. For example, a 10% increase in alcohol policy score was associated with a 28% reduction in the rate of suicides involving alcohol or firearms. Similarly, a 10% increase in gun policy score was associated with a 14% decrease in the rate of suicides involving firearms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These relationships were similar for suicides that involved alcohol and firearms. For example, a 10% increase in alcohol policy score was associated with a 52% reduction in the rate of suicides involving alcohol and firearms. A 10% increase in gun policy score was associated with a 26% reduction in the rate of suicides involving alcohol and firearms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we found synergistic effects between alcohol and firearm policies, such that states with restrictive policies for both alcohol and firearms had the lowest odds of suicides involving alcohol and firearms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and next steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results of the study suggest that laws restricting firearms ownership among high-risk individuals, including those who drink excessively or have experienced alcohol-related criminal offenses, may reduce firearm suicides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found restrictive alcohol and firearm policies to be associated with lower rates and odds of suicides involving alcohol or firearms, and alcohol and firearms and our research suggests that alcohol and firearm policies may be a promising means by which to reduce suicide. These protective relationships were particularly striking for suicides involving both alcohol and firearms as well as in the strong protective interaction between alcohol and firearm policy variables, particularly for suicides involving alcohol. These findings, taken in the context of the broader literature, also suggest that laws restricting firearms ownership among high-risk individuals (so-called ‘may issue’ laws), including those who drink excessively or have experienced alcohol-related criminal offenses, may reduce firearm suicides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this was a cross-sectional analysis, this should be considered a hypothesis-generating study that cannot prove a causal association between alcohol or firearm policies and suicide. In future research, studies using multiple years of policy and suicide data would strengthen causal inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stronger alcohol and firearm policies are a promising means to prevent a leading and increasing cause of death in the U.S. The findings further suggest that strengthening both policy areas may have a synergistic impact on reducing suicides involving either alcohol, firearms, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

Humphries' novel approach to brain exposition is built around — &lt;i&gt;well&lt;/i&gt; — the spike, the electrical signal neurons use to communicate. In this magical rendition, the 2.1 second journey through the brain takes 174 pages (plus Acknowledgments and Endnotes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven't read the entire book, so this is not a proper book review. But here's an overview of what I might expect. The Introduction is filled with  inventive prose like, “We will wander through the splendor of the richly stocked prefrontal cortex and stand in terror before the wall of noise emanating from the basal ganglia.” (p. 10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Did You Know That Your Life Can Be Reduced To Spikes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there's the splendor and terror of a life reduced to spikes (p. 3):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“All told, your lifespan is about thirty-four billion billion cortical spikes.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spike Drama&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But will I grow weary of overly dramatic interpretations of spikes? “Our spike's arrival rips open bags of molecules stored at the end of the axon, forcing their contents to be dumped into the gap, and diffuse to the other side.” (p. 29-30).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waiting for me on the other side of burst vesicles are intriguing chapters on &lt;i&gt;Failure&lt;/i&gt; (dead end spikes) and &lt;i&gt;Dark Neurons&lt;/i&gt;, the numerous weirdos who remain silent while their neighbors are “screaming at the top of [their] lungs.” (p. 83). I anticipate this story like a good mystery novel with wry throwaway observations (p. 82):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Neuroimaging—functional MRI—shows us Technicolor images of the cortex, its regions lit up in a swirling riot of poorly chosen colors that make the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2021&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pantone&lt;/a&gt; people cry into their tasteful coffee mugs.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PV4X0esWagQ/YDwDB5J1teI/AAAAAAAANRE/B94Zw-XpdA4suJBveTK7Ucn81zXHT2JsQCLcBGAsYHQ/s698/Pantone%2B2021.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;662&quot; data-original-width=&quot;698&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PV4X0esWagQ/YDwDB5J1teI/AAAAAAAANRE/B94Zw-XpdA4suJBveTK7Ucn81zXHT2JsQCLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h303/Pantone%2B2021.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;Pantone colors of 2021 are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2021&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;PANTONE 17-5104 Ultimate Gray&quot;&gt;gray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2021&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;PANTONE 13-0647 Illuminating&quot;&gt;yellow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wherever it ends up – with a mind-blowing new vision of the brain based on spontaneous spikes, or with just another opinion on predictive coding theory – I predict &lt;i&gt;THE SPIKE&lt;/i&gt; will be an epic and entertaining journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jFPuew2F0Tk/YDwM7o8VgaI/AAAAAAAANRM/UjebKZHH918reNDD8FV40uHov2olPHFxQCLcBGAsYHQ/s845/The%2BSpike%2Btable%2Bof%2Bcontents.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;845&quot; data-original-width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jFPuew2F0Tk/YDwM7o8VgaI/AAAAAAAANRM/UjebKZHH918reNDD8FV40uHov2olPHFxQCLcBGAsYHQ/w379-h400/The%2BSpike%2Btable%2Bof%2Bcontents.png&quot; width=&quot;379&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;feedflare&quot;&gt;

		<link href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/02/26/why-arxiv-needs-a-brand/"/>
		<id>https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/?p=856</id>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pop quiz: There are so many “-Xivs” online and on social media.  Which ones are operated by arXiv?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer: only &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/arxiv&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@arXiv&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv is a highly valued tool known primarily through its digital presence. However, the use of arXiv’s name by other services has led to confusion. And despite decades of reliable service, arXiv’s inconsistent visuals and voice have projected an air of neglect. This jeopardizes our ability to raise funds for critical improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As the role of arXiv in open science becomes more evident, its value should be made obvious lest we end up losing the system we cherish and rely upon so much,” said Alberto Accomazzi, PhD, ADS Program Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Accomazzi joined nine other diverse community members to become part of an advisory group formed to support arXiv’s communications and identity project. The goal? To ensure that the way we present ourselves to the world reflects arXiv’s true nature as a professional, innovative tool created by and for researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the identity project, we:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assessed user feedback collected since 2016,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;surveyed board members and 7,000 additional users about their perceptions of arXiv,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gathered ten diverse community members to serve as advisors,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contracted with a professional designer to produce a logo, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are working with an accessibility consultant to address the needs of all arXiv readers and authors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To guide our branding efforts we focused on &lt;b&gt;arXiv as a place of connection, linking together people and ideas, and connecting them with the world of open science&lt;/b&gt;. After many rounds of revision and refinement, &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Guide_2021.pdf&quot;&gt;arXiv’s first brand guide&lt;/a&gt; was produced, in addition to our new logo and &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Usage_2021.pdf&quot;&gt;usage guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, and we’d like to share them with you now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_948&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;arXiv's logo&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-948 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-300x135.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 10px;&quot; width=&quot;260&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The intertwining arms at the heart of the logo represent arXiv as a place of connection&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arXiv logo looks to the future and nods to the past with a font that pays homage to arXiv’s birth in the 90’s while also being forward looking. The arms of the ‘X’ retain stylistic elements of the ‘chi’ in our name, with a lengthened top left and lower right branch. Symbolically, &lt;strong&gt;the intertwining of the arms at the heart of the logo&lt;/strong&gt; captures the spirit of arXiv’s core value. arXiv is a place of connection, linking together people and ideas, and connecting them with the world of open science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Guide_2021.pdf&quot;&gt;brand guide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.arxiv.org/static/arxiv.marxdown/0.1/about/arXiv_Brand_Usage_2021.pdf&quot;&gt;usage guidelines&lt;/a&gt; ensure that we express arXiv’s identity with consistent quality and continuity across communication channels. By strengthening our identity in this way, arXiv will be recognizable and distinct from other services. Staff will save time by having access to clear, consistent guidelines, visual assets, and style sheets, and collaborators will know the expectations regarding arXiv logo usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arXiv community will notice that the main arXiv.org site remains the same at this time. That’s because the identity rollout and implementation process will be gradual, starting with official documents before moving to core arXiv services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“arXiv must take control of its identity to maintain its place and grow within the scholarly communications ecosystem,” said arXiv’s executive director Eleonora Presani, PhD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        &lt;/figure&gt;
      

    
  


  


&lt;h2&gt;Where is the red nucleus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The red nucleus is found in a region of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/brainstem&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brainstem&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/midbrain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;midbrain&lt;/a&gt;. There are actually two red nuclei—one on each side of the brainstem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The red nucleus can be subdivided into two structures that are generally distinct in function: the parvocellular red nucleus, which mainly contains small and medium-sized &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt;, and the magnocellular red nucleus, which contains larger neurons. The red nucleus is recognizable immediately after dissection because it maintains a reddish coloring. This coloring is thought to be due to iron pigments found in the cells of the nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the red nucleus and what does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;As mentioned above, the red nucleus can be subdivided into two structures with separate functions: the parvocellular red nucleus and the magnocellular red nucleus. In the human brain, most of the red nucleus is made up of the parvocellular red nucleus, or RNp; the magnocellular red nucleus (RNm) is not thought to play a major role in the adult human brain. In four-legged mammals (e.g., cats, mice), however, the RNm is a more prominent structure—in both size and importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Neurons from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebellum&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cerebellum&lt;/a&gt; project to the RNm, and RNm neurons leave the red nucleus and form the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/rubrospinal-tract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rubrospinal tract&lt;/a&gt;, which descends in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/spinal-cord&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spinal cord&lt;/a&gt;. In animals that walk on four legs, this pathway is activated around the time of voluntary movements; it seems to play an important role in walking, avoiding obstacles, and making coordinated paw movements. RNm neurons, however, also respond to sensory stimulation, and may provide sensory feedback to the cerebellum to help guide movements and maintain postural stability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In primates that mainly walk on two legs (including humans), the RNm is not thought to play a large role in walking and maintaining postural stability, as other tracts (e.g., the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/corticospinal-tract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;corticospinal tract&lt;/a&gt;) take over such functions. The RNm, however, does appear to be involved in controlling hand movements in humans and other primates. Interestingly, the RNm is more prominent in the human fetus and newborn, but regresses as a child ages, which may have to do with the development of corticospinal tract and the ability to walk on two legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite its relatively greater import in the human brain, the RNp is poorly understood, as its diminished presence in other animals makes it more difficult to study using an animal model. Neurons from motor areas in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/prefrontal-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/premotor-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;premotor cortex&lt;/a&gt;, as well as neurons from nuclei in the cerebellum known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/deep-cerebellar-nuclei&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deep cerebellar nuclei&lt;/a&gt;, extend to the RNp. There is also a collection of neurons that leave the RNp and travel to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/inferior-olivary-nucleus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inferior olivary nucleus&lt;/a&gt;, which communicates with the cerebellum and is thought to be involved in the control of movement. A number of proposed functions have been attributed to these connections between the RNp, cerebellum, and inferior olivary nucleus, such as movement learning, the acquisition of reflexes, and the detection of errors in movements. But the precise function of these pathways—and thus the RNp’s role in them—is still not clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Several studies have found the red nucleus to play a role in pain sensation as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/analgesia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;analgesia&lt;/a&gt;. The latter might be due to connections between the red nucleus and regions like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/periaqueductal-gray&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;periaqueductal gray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/raphe-nuclei&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;raphe nuclei&lt;/a&gt;, which are part of a natural pain-inhibiting system in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In terms of pathology, dysfunction in the human red nucleus has been linked to the development of tremors, and is being investigated as playing a potential role in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/parkinsons-disease&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. Damage to the red nucleus has also been associated with a number of other problems with movement and muscle tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;References (in addition to linked text above):&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Basile GA, Quartu M, Bertino S, Serra MP, Boi M, Bramanti A, Anastasi GP, Milardi D, Cacciola A.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/hookah-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water pipe smoking as a public health crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water Pipe Smoking (WPS) accounts for a significant and growing share of tobacco use globally. WPS is a culture-based method of tobacco use and it has experienced a worldwide re-emergence since 1990 and is regaining popularity among different groups of populations, especially in school and university students. Similarly, WPS is also prevalent among highly educated groups. Although WPS is most prevalent in Asia, specifically the Middle East region and Africa, it has now been changed to a rapidly emerging problem in other continents such as Europe, North, and South America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;WP business has remained largely unregulated and uncontrolled, which may result in the increasing prevalence of WPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been shown that WPS’ smoking rate can be more addictive compared to that of the cigarette. It has a huge negative impact on populations’ health, health costs and the gross domestic product of the countries. WP business has remained largely unregulated and uncontrolled, which may result in the increasing prevalence of WPS. Using deceptive advertising, many cafes and restaurants offer WP services along with their orthodox services in order to earn more profit and lure more customers. The provision of flavored tobacco products or psychotropic WP, the proximity of WP cafe to the public settings such as educational or residential settings and sports clubs, tempting decoration, the provision of study places for students, live music, a variety of games and gambling, and the possibility of watching live movie and sport matches are the factors contribute to attracting children and adolescents to WP cafes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The importance of our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the concerns about WPS outcomes and nearly three decades of using control measures, the prevalence of WPS has increased over the world. Due to the unique nature of WP (multi-components), little is known about the prevention and control of WPS. Thus, special interventions might be required to prevent and control WP tobacco use. Accordingly, our study published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; aimed to identify the management interventions in international and national levels for preventing and controlling water pipe smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a systematic literature review. Studies aiming at evaluating, at least, one intervention in preventing and controlling WPS were included in this review, followed by performing the quality assessment and data extraction of eligible studies by two independent investigators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deleting duplications, 2228 out of 4343 retrieved records remained and 38 studies were selected as the main corpus of the present study. The selected studies focused on 19 different countries including the United States (13.15 %), the United Kingdom (7.89 %), Germany (5.26 %), Iran (5.26 %), Egypt (5.26%), Malaysia (2.63%), India (2.63%), Denmark (2.63%), Pakistan (2.63%), Qatar (2.63%), Jordan(2.63%), Lebanon (2.63%), Syria (2.63%), Turkey (2.63%), Bahrain (2.63%), Israel (2.63%), the United Arab Emirates (2.63%), Saudi Arabia (2.63%), and Switzerland (2.63%). Additionally, the type of study design included cross-sectional (31.57 %), quasi-experimental (15.78 %) and qualitative types (23.68 %).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interventions that were identified from the content analysis process were discussed and classified into relevant categories. We identified 27 interventions that were grouped into four main categories including preventive (5,18.51%) and control (8, 29.62%) interventions, as well as the enactment and implementation of legislations and policies for controlling WPS at national (7, 25.92%) and international (7, 25.92%) levels. The interventions are shown in the following table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12287&quot; style=&quot;width: 744px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12287 size-full&quot; height=&quot;727&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/blog-table-Word.png&quot; width=&quot;734&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Table: Effective Interventions in Preventing and Controlling Water Pipe Smoking&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current enforced legislations are old, unclear, incompatible with the needs of the adolescents and are not backed by rigorous evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, our findings indicated WPS related social and health crisis have not come into attention in high levels of policy making. The current enforced legislations are old, unclear, incompatible with the needs of the adolescents and are not backed by rigorous evidence. In addition, the WP industry is rapidly expanding without monitoring and controlling measures. Informing and empowering adolescents for those who have not yet experienced smoking is a sensible intervention in this regard. Besides, empowering and involving health students and professionals in WPS control programs can lead to promising results in preventing and controlling WPS. It seems that there is a paucity of evidence regarding strategies on controlling and preventing WTS, thus further research in the society is warranted in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Chinthani Karandeni Dewage will talk about a paper &quot;Interactions between Brassica Napus and Extracellular Fungal Pathogen Pyrenopeziza Brassicae&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light leaf spot (Pyrenopeziza brassicae) is currently the most
damaging foliar disease on winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in the
UK. Deployment of cultivar resistance remains an important aspect of
effective management of the disease. Nevertheless, the genetic basis
of resistance remains poorly understood and no B. napus resistance (R)
genes against P. brassicae have been cloned. In this talk, I will be
presenting the findings from my research on host resistance against P.
brassicae and specific interactions in this pathosystem. New
possibilities offered by genomic approaches for rapid identification
of R genes and pathogenicity determinants will also be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/645043306/0/oupblogpsychology~Darwin%e2%80%99s-theory-of-agency-back-to-the-future-in-evolutionary-science/"/>

		<updated>2021-02-24T13:30:21+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;Was Darwin a one-trick pony? The scientists who most praise him typically cite just one of his ideas: natural selection. Do any know that his theory of evolution—like his take on psychology—presumed all creatures were agents? This fact has long been eclipsed by the “gene’s-eye view” of adaptation which gained a strangle-hold over biology during the twentieth century—and hence over sociobiology and today’s evolutionary psychology. Are current efforts to revise this view—emphasising “new” topics like the flexibility of phenotypes (an organism’s living characteristics) and the importance of development in adaptation—simply rediscovering Darwin’s approach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do members of a species come to differ from each other, thus furnishing the raw material for the struggle whose results Darwin subsumed under what he called the &lt;em&gt;law&lt;/em&gt; of natural selection? In two ways, wrote Darwin in 1859. A creature’s parents &lt;em&gt;transmit&lt;/em&gt; different characteristics to them as starting-points for their lives. And, over their life-course, creatures &lt;em&gt;develop&lt;/em&gt; their starting-characteristics in different ways, depending on how they respond to the various challenges they meet. In 1942, Julian Huxley and his colleagues recast natural selection as &lt;em&gt;a mechanism&lt;/em&gt;, not a law. Imagine twinned roulette-wheels: each individual’s evolutionary fate resulted from a random genetic provision of phenotypic traits being pitted against a lottery of environmental events. This new language of genes, genomes, and (from 1953) DNA, made Darwin look ignorant about how individual differences arose. Dying before genes or DNA were discovered, he never knew that mutations and chromosome-changes caused all variations (according to Huxley).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To retain Darwin as the figurehead of this gene-first take on nature, he was retro-fitted with twentieth-century beliefs. If DNA “programmes” what creatures are and do, genetic processes drive evolution forward, not creaturely acts. Hence, Huxley asserted, the “great merit” of Darwin was his proof that living organisms never acted purposively: everything they did could be accounted for “on good mechanistic principles.” Likewise, even when Harvard biologist Richard Lewontin spoke out &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; the way the cult of genes blinds us to the active role organisms play in adaptation, his first target was Darwin, who, Lewontin said, portrayed organisms “as passive objects moulded by the external force of natural selection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewontin’s vouch that organisms help shape their own fates is now gaining traction. Few genes behave as they should according to Mendel. So, talk about genes “for” a phenotypic character is rarely appropriate. Even when we know everything we can about genes and environment, we still cannot predict what characteristics will emerge in an organism—proving phenotypes are independent sources of plasticity in the genesis of adaptations. Organisms help cause their own development and destiny, which means phenotypes themselves have evolutionary effects. Never mind why a fly hatches from its pupa to be small: its unusually big surface to volume ratio cannot help but shape its remaining life-history. This point underlines findings from biologists who study animal behaviour. Beavers build dams, chimps and crows make tools, wolves hunt better in packs. All such feats alter the evolutionary prospects of phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin’s books herald all these emphases: the distinction between transmission and development when discussing inheritance; the “plasticity of organisation” in all creatures; and, importantly here, the tie between action and structure. Darwin saw nature as a theatre of agency. The roots of cabbage seedlings successfully improvised, after Darwin experimentally blocked them from plunging straight down into the earth. Earthworms “intelligently” grasped how best to tug his artificially-shaped “leaves” to plug their holes against the cold. And when newly-arrived finches were competing for food on the Galapagos Islands, it must have been the birds who first found the best new diets—not random genetic changes—who gained reproductive supremacy and consequently, over millennia, such new bodily adaptations as the skin-piercing beak of blood-sucking Vampire Finches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actions produce reactions, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; repeatedly reminds us. Which means an organism’s actions inevitably render it interdependent with its habitat, animate and inanimate. Such ties may be competitive or cooperative—“mutual aid” being the hallmark of evolution in “social animals” like us. Hence, when Darwin published his views on human agency in &lt;em&gt;The Descent of Man&lt;/em&gt;—first published 150 years ago this month—and its sequel, &lt;em&gt;The Expression of the Emotions&lt;/em&gt; (1872), social interdependency took pride of place. Darwin argued non-verbal expressions to be &lt;em&gt;purposeless&lt;/em&gt; by-products of functional habits—we weep because we protectively close our eyes when screaming, incidentally squeezing our tear-glands. Such unintended side-effects only come to signify emotion because &lt;em&gt;others “&lt;/em&gt;recognize” their meaning as linked to suffering. When I blush, my inbuilt capacity for reading expressions has rebounded, leading me to read in you how I imagine you to be reading me. Such “self-attention” underpins sexual display, plus such quintessentially human traits as language, culture, and conscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go back to what Darwin wrote about evolution, and you will hear him speaking from a place that the latest biology now renders prescient. Interdependencies of agency not only forge individual differences, and winnow the kernels of inter-generational success from the chaff of failure. They also compose Darwin’s unsung creation of the first naturalistic psychology.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Yale University posted the following announcement on its website on February 23, 2021&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yale University Library has signed two innovative agreements that will allow Yale-affiliated authors to publish in any PLOS open access journal without paying article processing charges (APCs).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS is a non-profit, open access publisher of seven highly respected scientific and medical journals. Last year Yale authors published more than 100 articles in PLOS journals, with APCs of up to $3,000 per article. Effective Jan. 1, 2021, these author-paid APCs will be eliminated and replaced with annual fees paid by the library. The authors will maintain copyright ownership of their research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to make open access publishing a more viable option for more Yale researchers in science and medicine, and to support a publication model that will also encourage open access publishing beyond Yale,” said Barbara Rockenbach, the Stephen Gates ’68 University Librarian.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Open access publishing has grown in popularity since the 1990s when peer-reviewed journals began publishing online with a traditional business model based on limited access and high subscription fees. Open access developed as an alternative to make new research quickly and widely available with financial support from those producing the research. However, financial support for APCs from academic departments, government, and other research funders has varied widely, with some authors having to pay from personal funds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The library agreements will eliminate APCs for Yale authors publishing in PLOS Biology, PLOS Medicine, PLOS One, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Pathogens, PLOS Genetics, and PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, as well as in any new PLOS publications launched during the contract term. The initial agreements are for three years and will be funded through Yale Library’s Collection Development department with support from the Cushing/Whitney Medical Library.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are pleased that Yale Library can support this emerging, more sustainable model of open-access publishing,” Rockenbach said. “We are committed to facilitating equitable access to research in science and medicine–and the progress research fuels.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;On Twitter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RichieHakim/status/1363545448317878282&quot;&gt;Richie Hakim asked&lt;/a&gt; whether the toolbox Cascade for spike inference (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;) induces temporal dispersion of the predicted spiking activity compared to ground truth. This kind of temporal dispersion had been observed in a study from last year (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008198&quot;&gt;Wei et al., PLoS Comp Biol, 2020&lt;/a&gt;; also discussed in a previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/2020/09/14/discrepancies-between-calcium-imaging-and-extracellular-ephys-recordings/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;), suggesting that analyses based on raw or deconvolved calcium imaging data might falsely suggest continuous sequences of neuronal activations, while the true activity patterns are coming in discrete bouts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To approach this question, I used one of our 27 ground truth datasets (the one recorded for the original GCaMP6f paper). From all recordings in this data set, I detected events that exceeded a certain ground truth spike rate. Next, I assigned these extracted events in 3 groups and systematically shifted the detected event of groups 1 and 3 by 0.5 seconds forth and back. Note that this is a short shift compared to the timescale investigated by the Wei et al. paper. This is how the ground truth looks like. It is clearly not a continuous sequence of activations:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6749&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6749&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;noise2_1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_1.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_1.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_1.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1329,561&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/noise2_1/&quot; height=&quot;196&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_1.png?w=1024&quot; width=&quot;465&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether the three-bout pattern would result in a continuous sequence after spike inference, I just used the dF/F recordings associated with above ground truth recordings and Cascade’s global model for excitatory neurons (a pretrained network that is available with the toolbox), I infered the spike rates. There is indeed some dispersion due to the difficulty to infer spike rates from noisy data. But the three bouts are very clearly visible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6751&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6751&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;noise2_2&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_2.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_2.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_2.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1336,569&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/noise2_2/&quot; height=&quot;204&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_2.png?w=1024&quot; width=&quot;478&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is even more apparent when plotting the average spike rate across neurons:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6757&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6757&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;noise2_3-1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_3-1.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_3-1.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_3-1.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1340,568&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/noise2_3-1/&quot; height=&quot;212&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_3-1.png?w=1024&quot; width=&quot;502&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it can be concluded that there are conditions and existing datasets where discrete activity bouts can be clearly distinguished from sequential activations based on spike rates inferred with Cascade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This analysis was performed on neurons at a standardized noise level of 2% Hz&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2&quot;&gt;preprint &lt;/a&gt;for a proper definition of the standardized noise level). This is a typical and very decent noise level for population calcium imaging. However, if we perform the same analysis on the same data set but with a relatively high noise level of 8% Hz&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, the resulting predictions are indeed much more dispersed, since the dF/F patterns are too noisy to make more precise predictions. The average spike rate still shows three peaks, but they are only riding on top of a more broadly distributed, seemingly persistent increase of the spike rate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6758&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6758&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;noise8-1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise8-1.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise8-1.png?w=224&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise8-1.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1317,1765&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/noise8-1/&quot; height=&quot;671&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise8-1.png?w=764&quot; width=&quot;502&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to play around with this analysis with different noise levels or different data sets, you do not need to install anything. You can just, within less than 5 minutes, run &lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/github/PTRRupprecht/Calcium_imaging_and_temporal_dispersion/blob/main/Temporal_dispersion_of_activity_from_deconvolved_calcium_imaging.ipynb&quot;&gt;this Colaboratory Notebook&lt;/a&gt; in your browser and reproduce the above results.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<updated>2021-02-22T15:45:12+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="fr-FR">
 &lt;p&gt;Dans ce texte, j’essaie d’expliquer quelques concepts simples concernant la dynamique et le contrôle d’une épidémie. Je l’écris bien sûr en pensant à l’épidémie de Covid-19, mais la plupart des concepts sont généraux. En préambule, je tiens à préciser que je ne suis ni médecin ni épidémiologiste, donc je ne parlerai pratiquement pas des aspects purement médicaux, ni de subtilités d’épidémiologie, mais simplement de quelques notions générales. Ma spécialité est la modélisation de phénomènes dynamiques en biologie, en l’occurrence en neurosciences. Merci donc aux collègues compétents d’apporter des précisions ou corrections éventuelles, ou des références pertinentes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quelques remarques préliminaires sur les statistiques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avant de commencer les explications, je voudrais tout d’abord inviter le lecteur à la prudence quant à l’interprétation des statistiques, en particulier des statistiques de mortalité. A l’heure où j’écris ces lignes, on estime qu’environ 15% de la population française a été infectée. Autrement dit, l’épidémie est débutante. Les statistiques de mortalité ne sont donc pas un « bilan » de l’épidémie, mais des statistiques sur une épidémie en cours. Comparer avec le bilan d’épidémies passées, ou d’autres causes de mortalité, n’a donc pas beaucoup de sens (éventuellement, on pourrait multiplier par 5 ces statistiques pour avoir un ordre d’idée).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuxièmement, la mortalité d’une maladie ne dépend pas que du virus. Elle dépend aussi de la personne malade. Un facteur majeur est l’âge, et il faut donc prendre cela en compte lorsque l’on compare des pays de démographies très différentes. En première approximation, le risque de décès de la Covid-19 augmente avec l’âge de la même manière que le risque de décès hors Covid. On peut voir cela comme le fait que les jeunes sont peu à risque, ou bien que toutes les classes d’âge voient leur risque de décès dans l’année augmenter d’un même facteur. Quoi qu’il en soit, avec ce type de profil de mortalité, l’âge moyen ou médian au décès n’est pas très informatif puisqu’il est le même avec et sans infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troisièmement, la mortalité d’une maladie dépend aussi de la prise en charge. En l’occurrence, la Covid-19 se caractérise par un fort taux d’hospitalisation et de réanimation. La mortalité observée en France jusqu’à présent correspond à celle d’un système de soin qui n’est pas saturé. Naturellement, elle serait bien plus élevée si l’on ne pouvait pas procurer ces soins, c’est-à-dire si l’épidémie n’était pas contrôlée, et la mortalité se déplacerait également vers une population plus jeune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enfin, il va de soi que la gravité d’une maladie ne se réduit pas à sa mortalité. Une hospitalisation n’est généralement pas anodine, et les cas moins sévères peuvent avoir des séquelles à long terme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Le taux de reproduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Un virus est une entité qui peut se répliquer dans un hôte et se transmettre à d’autres hôtes. Contrairement à une bactérie qui est une cellule, un virus n’est pas à proprement parler un organisme, c’est-à-dire qu’il dépend totalement de l’hôte pour sa survie et sa reproduction. Par conséquent, pour comprendre la dynamique d’une épidémie virale, il faut s’intéresser au nombre d’hôtes infectés et à la transmission entre hôtes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Un paramètre important est le &lt;em&gt;taux de reproduction &lt;/em&gt;(R). C’est le nombre moyen de personnes qu’une personne infectée va contaminer. On voit que l’épidémie se développe si R&amp;gt;1, et s’éteint si R&amp;lt;1. A chaque transmission, le nombre de cas est multiplié par R. Ce taux de reproduction ne dit pas à quelle vitesse l’épidémie se développe, car cela dépend du temps d’incubation et de la période de contagiosité. C’est en fait un paramètre qui est surtout intéressant pour comprendre le contrôle de l’épidémie. Par exemple, si &lt;em&gt;R = 2&lt;/em&gt;, alors on peut contrôler l’épidémie en divisant par deux le nombre de ses contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comme le nombre de cas est multiplié par un certain facteur à chaque épisode de contamination, une épidémie a typiquement une dynamique exponentielle, c’est-à-dire que c’est le nombre de chiffres qui augmente régulièrement. Cela prend autant de temps de passer de 10 à 100 cas que de 100 à 1000 cas, ou de 1000 à 10 000 cas. La dynamique est donc de nature explosive. C’est pourquoi la quantité à suivre avec attention n’est pas tant le nombre de cas que ce taux de reproduction : dès que R&amp;gt;1, le nombre de cas peut rapidement exploser et il faut agir vite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturellement, ce raisonnement suppose que la population n’a pas été déjà infectée. Si une proportion &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; de la population est immunisée (infectée ou vaccinée), alors chaque personne infectée va contaminer en moyenne un nombre de personnes &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; x (1-&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;). L’épidémie va donc s’arrêter quand ce nombre descend en-dessous de 1, c’est-à-dire &lt;em&gt;p &amp;gt; 1- 1/R&lt;/em&gt;. Par exemple, avec &lt;em&gt;R = 3&lt;/em&gt;, l’épidémie s’arrête quand les 2/3 de population sont immunisés.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceci nous dit également l’impact de la vaccination en cours sur le contrôle de l’épidémie. Par exemple, à l’heure où j’écris ces lignes (22 février 2021), environ 2% de la population a été vaccinée (4% a reçu la première dose). Cela contribue donc à diminuer R de 2% (par exemple de 1.1 à 1.08). Il est donc clair que la vaccination n’aura pas d’effet important sur la dynamique globale avant plusieurs mois.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il est important de comprendre que ce taux de reproduction n’est pas une caractéristique intrinsèque du virus. Il dépend du virus, mais également de l’hôte qui peut être plus ou moins contagieux (on a parlé par exemple des « superspreaders »), d’aspects comportementaux, de mesures de protection (par exemple les masques). Ce taux n’est donc pas forcément homogène dans une population. Par exemple, il est vraisemblable que le R soit supérieur chez les jeunes actifs que chez les personnes âgées.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peut-on isoler une partie de la population ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Est-il possible de préserver la population la plus fragile en l’isolant du reste de la population, sans contrôler l’épidémie ? Cette hypothèse a été formulée plusieurs fois, bien que &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6526/230&quot;&gt;très critiquée dans la littérature scientifique&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On peut comprendre assez facilement que c’est une idée périlleuse. Isoler une partie de la population a un impact quasi nul sur le taux de reproduction R, et donc la dynamique de l’épidémie est inchangée. Il faut bien garder à l’esprit que contrôler une épidémie pour qu’elle s’éteigne suppose simplement de faire en sorte que R&amp;lt;1, de façon à ce que le nombre de cas décroisse exponentiellement. Ainsi pendant le confinement strict de mars 2020, le taux était d’environ R = 0.7. C’est suffisant pour que l’épidémie s’éteigne, mais il n’en reste pas moins qu’une personne infectée continue à contaminer d’autres gens. Par conséquent, à moins de parvenir à isoler ces personnes fragiles beaucoup plus strictement que lors du premier confinement (ce qui semble douteux étant donné qu’il s’agit pour partie de personnes dépendantes), l’épidémie dans cette population va suivre l’épidémie dans la population générale, avec la même dynamique mais dans une version un peu atténuée. Autrement dit, il semble peu plausible que cette stratégie soit efficace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Les variants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Un virus peut muter, c’est-à-dire que lorsqu’il se réplique dans un hôte, des erreurs sont introduites de sorte que les propriétés du virus changent. Cela peut avoir un impact sur les symptômes, ou sur la contagiosité. Naturellement, plus il y a d’hôtes infectés, plus il y a de variants, c’est donc un phénomène qui survient dans des épidémies non contrôlées.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supposons que R = 2 et qu’un variant ait un taux R = 4. Alors à chaque transmission, le nombre de cas du variant relatif au virus original est multiplié par 2. Au bout de 10 transmissions, le variant représente 99.9% des cas. Ceci reste vrai si des mesures restrictives réduisent la transmission (par exemple R=2/3 et R=4/3). Après ces 10 transmissions, le R global est celui du variant. Par conséquent, c’est le nombre de cas et le R du variant plus contagieux qui déterminent le nombre de cas et la dynamique à moyen terme (c’est-à-dire quelques semaines). Le nombre de cas du virus original et même le nombre de cas globaux sont essentiellement insignifiants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cela signifie que l’on peut être dans une dynamique explosive alors même que le nombre de cas diminue. Pour savoir si l’épidémie est sous contrôle, il faut regarder le R du variant le plus contagieux. A l’heure où j’écris, on est précisément dans la situation où le virus original est encore dominant avec R&amp;lt;1 et les variants ont un R&amp;gt;1, ce qui signifie que malgré une diminution globale des cas, on est dans une dynamique explosive qui sera apparente dans le nombre global de cas lorsque les variants seront dominants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Le contrôle épidémique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrôler l’épidémie signifie faire en sorte que R&amp;lt;1. Dans cette situation, le nombre de cas diminue exponentiellement et s’approche de 0. Il ne s’agit pas nécessairement de supprimer toute transmission mais de faire en sorte par une combinaison de mesures que R soit plus petit que 1. Ainsi, passer de R = 1.1 à 0.9 suffit pour passer d’une épidémie explosive à une extinction de l’épidémie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturellement, la mesure la plus sûre pour éteindre l’épidémie est d’empêcher toute relation sociale (le « confinement »). Mais il existe potentiellement de nombreuses autres mesures, et idéalement il s’agit de combiner plusieurs mesures à la fois efficaces et peu contraignantes, le confinement pouvant être utilisé en dernier recours lorsque ces mesures ont échoué. La difficulté est que l’impact d’une mesure n’est pas précisément connu pour un virus nouveau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ces connaissances sont cependant loin d’être négligeables après un an d’épidémie de Covid-19. On sait par exemple que le port du masque est très efficace (on s’en doutait déjà, étant donné que c’est une infection respiratoire). On sait que le virus se propage par projection de gouttelettes et par aérosols. On sait également que les écoles et les lieux de restauration collective sont des lieux importants de contamination. Cette observation peut conduire à fermer ces lieux, mais on pourrait alternativement les sécuriser par l’installation de ventilation et de filtres (investissement qui pourrait d’ailleurs être synergique avec un plan de rénovation énergétique).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il y a deux grands types de mesures. Il y a des mesures globales qui s’appliquent aux personnes saines comme aux porteurs du virus, comme le port du masque, la fermeture de certains lieux, la mise en place du télétravail. Le coût de ces mesures (au sens large, c’est-à-dire le coût économique et les contraintes) est fixe. Il y a des mesures spécifiques, c’est-à-dire qui sont déclenchées lorsqu’il y a un cas, comme le traçage, la fermeture d’une école, le confinement local. Ces mesures spécifiques ont un coût proportionnel au nombre de cas. Le coût global est donc une combinaison d’un coût fixe et d’un coût proportionnel au nombre de cas. Par conséquent, il est toujours plus coûteux de maîtriser une épidémie lorsque le nombre de cas est plus grand (choix qui semble pourtant avoir été fait en France après le deuxième confinement).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Le « plateau »&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Une remarque importante : les mesures ont un impact sur la progression de l’épidémie (R) et non directement sur le nombre de cas. Cela signifie que si l’on sait maintenir un nombre de cas haut (R=1), alors on sait tout aussi bien (avec les mêmes mesures), maintenir un nombre de cas bas. Avec un petit effort supplémentaire (R=0.9), on peut supprimer l’épidémie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoir comme objectif la saturation hospitalière n’a donc pas particulièrement d’intérêt, et est même un choix plus coûteux que la suppression. Il existe une justification à cet objectif, la stratégie consistant à « aplatir la courbe », qui a été suggérée au début de l’épidémie. Il s’agit de maximiser le nombre de personnes infectées de façon à immuniser rapidement toute la population. Maintenant qu’il existe un vaccin, cette stratégie n’a plus beaucoup de sens. Même sans vaccin, infecter toute la population sans saturer les services hospitaliers prendrait plusieurs années, sans parler naturellement de la mortalité.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;La suppression de l’épidémie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comme remarqué précédemment, il est plus facile de maîtriser une épidémie faible que forte, et donc une stratégie de contrôle doit viser non un nombre de cas « acceptables », mais un taux de reproduction R&amp;lt;1. Dans cette situation, le nombre de cas décroît exponentiellement. Lorsque le nombre de cas est très bas, il faut prendre en compte les cas importés. C’est-à-dire que sur une période de contamination, le nombre de cas va passer non plus de &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; à &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; x &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; mais de &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; à &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; x &lt;em&gt;n + &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;, où &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; est le nombre de cas importés. Le nombre de cas va donc se stabiliser à &lt;em&gt;I/(1-R)&lt;/em&gt; (par exemple, 3 fois le nombre de cas importés si R = 2/3). Si l’on veut diminuer encore le nombre de cas, il devient alors important d’empêcher l’importation de nouveaux cas (tests, quarantaine, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorsque le nombre de cas est très bas, il devient faisable d’appliquer des mesures spécifiques très poussées, c’est-à-dire pour chaque cas. Par exemple, pour chaque cas, on isole la personne, et l’on teste et on isole toutes les personnes susceptibles d’être également porteuses. Non seulement on identifie les personnes potentiellement contaminées par la personne positive, mais on recherche également la source de la contamination. En effet, si l’épidémie est portée par des événements de supercontamination (« clusters »), alors il devient plus efficace de remonter à la source de la contamination puis de suivre les cas contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A faible circulation, comme on dispose de ces moyens supplémentaires pour diminuer la transmission, il devient possible de lever certains moyens non spécifiques (par exemple le confinement général ou autres restrictions sociales, les fermetures d’établissements et même le port du masque). Pour que les moyens spécifiques aient un impact important, un point clé est que la majorité des cas puissent être détectés. Cela suppose des tests systématiques massifs, par exemple en utilisant des tests salivaires, des drive-in, des tests groupés, des contrôles de température. Cela suppose que les personnes positives ne soient pas découragées de se tester et s’isoler (en particulier, en maintenant les revenus). Cela suppose également un isolement systématique en attente de résultat pour les cas suspectés. Autrement dit, pour avoir une chance de fonctionner, cette stratégie doit être appliquée de manière la plus systématique possible. L’appliquer sur 10% des cas n’a pratiquement aucun intérêt. C’est pourquoi elle n’a de sens que lorsque la circulation du virus est faible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il est important d’observer que dans cette stratégie, l’essentiel du coût et des contraintes est porté par le dispositif de test, puisque le traçage et l’isolement ne se produisent que lorsqu’un cas est détecté, ce qui idéalement arrive très rarement. Si elle demande une certaine logistique, c’est en revanche une stratégie économique et peu contraignante pour la population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quand agir ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J’ai expliqué que maintenir un niveau élevé de cas est plus coûteux et plus contraignant que maintenir un niveau faible de cas. Maintenir un niveau très faible de cas est encore moins coûteux et contraignant, bien que cela demande plus d’organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bien entendu, pour passer d’un plateau haut à un plateau bas, il faut que l’épidémie décroisse, et donc transitoirement appliquer des mesures importantes. Si l’épidémie n’est pas contrôlée – et je rappelle que cela est le cas dès lors qu’un variant est en croissance (R&amp;gt;1) même si le nombre global de cas décroît – ces mesures vont devoir être appliquées à un moment donné. Quand faut-il les appliquer ? Est-il plus avantageux d’attendre le plus possible avant de le faire ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ce n’est clairement jamais le cas, car plus on attend, plus le nombre de cas augmente et donc plus les mesures restrictives devront être appliquées longtemps avant d’atteindre l’objectif de circulation faible, où des mesures plus fines (traçage) pourront prendre le relais. Cela peut sembler contre-intuitif si le nombre de cas est en décroissance mais c’est pourtant bien le cas, parce que le nombre de cas à moyen terme ne dépend que du nombre de cas du variant le plus contagieux, et non du nombre de cas global. Donc, si le variant le plus contagieux est en expansion, attendre ne fait qu’allonger la durée des mesures restrictives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De combien ? Supposons que le nombre de cas du virus (le variant le plus contagieux) double chaque semaine, et que les mesures restrictives divisent le nombre de cas par 2 en une semaine. Alors attendre une semaine avant de les appliquer allongent ces mesures d’une semaine (j’insiste : allongent, et non simplement décalent). Dans l’hypothèse (plus réaliste) où les mesures sont un peu moins efficaces, chaque semaine d’attente augmente la durée des mesures d’un peu plus d’une semaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il est donc toujours préférable d’agir dès que R&amp;gt;1, de façon à agir le moins longtemps possible, et non pas d’attendre que le nombre de cas augmente considérablement. La seule justification possible à l’attente pourrait être une vaccination massive qui laisserait espérer une décroissance de l’épidémie par l’immunisation, ce qui n’est manifestement pas le cas dans l’immédiat.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;This blog was written by Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Director of Open Research Solutions for PLOS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Researchers are satisfied with their ability to share their own research data but may struggle with accessing other researchers’ data – according to PLOS research &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/njr5u&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;released as a preprint this week&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Therefore, to increase data sharing in a findable and accessible way, PLOS will focus on better integrating existing data repositories and promoting their benefits rather than creating new solutions. We also call on the scholarly publishing industry to improve journal data sharing policies to better support researchers’ needs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS has long supported Open Science with our data sharing policy. Our authors are far more likely to provide information about publicly available data compared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dashboard.stm-assoc.org/&quot;&gt;journals with less stringent policies&lt;/a&gt;. But best practice for data sharing – use of data repositories – is observed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230416&quot;&gt;less than 30% of PLOS publications&lt;/a&gt;. To help us understand if there are opportunities for new solutions to help improve adoption of best practice, we built on previous research into the frequency of problems associated with sharing research data. We investigated the &lt;em&gt;importance&lt;/em&gt; researchers attach to different tasks associated with data sharing, and researchers’ &lt;em&gt;satisfaction&lt;/em&gt; with their ability to complete these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/05/what-are-your-priorities-for-data-sharing/&quot;&gt;survey conducted in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which received 728 completed responses, we found that tasks relating to research impact, funder policy compliance, and credit had the highest importance scores. Tasks associated with funder, journal, and institutional policy compliance – including preparation of Data Management Plans (DMPs) – received high satisfaction scores from researchers, on average.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;52% of respondents reuse research data but the average satisfaction score for obtaining data for reuse – such as accessing data from journal articles or making requests for data from other individuals – was relatively low. Tasks associated with sharing data were rated somewhat important and respondents were reasonably well satisfied with their ability to accomplish them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;624&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/yitlUEq3MxJm9SMFMulTwu9TcLufAw66cpmaVwjgUQigSJ_s_9HgWwNur3kEyjqicTZ1h9UXHhk7m36GJmZYkaHuPEKoNgwXzAUtFS-An0pA0_r5TXKnWiL496UgLwxuhtXRemuD&quot; width=&quot;624&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; When we plot mean importance and satisfaction score, respondents were on average satisfied with their ability to complete the majority of tasks associated with Data Preparation, Data Publishing and Reuse of their own data but dissatisfied with their ability to complete tasks associated with Reuse of other researchers’ data. Tasks associated with meeting policy requirements are both important and well satisfied.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the implications?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We presume that researchers are unlikely to seek &lt;em&gt;new &lt;/em&gt;solutions to a problem or task that they are satisfied in their &lt;em&gt;ability &lt;/em&gt;to accomplish. This implies there are few opportunities for new solutions to meet researcher needs for data sharing – at least in our cohort, which consisted mostly of PLOS authors. PLOS – and other publishers – can likely meet these needs for data sharing by working to seamlessly integrate existing solutions that reduce the effort involved in some tasks, and focusing on advocacy and education around the benefits of sharing data in a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) manner. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The challenges that researchers have reusing data could be addressed in part by strengthening journal data sharing policies – such as only permitting “data available on request” when there are legal or ethical restrictions on sharing, and improving the links between articles and supporting datasets. Generic “data available on request” statements in publications, which are not permitted under PLOS’s policies, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011784&quot;&gt;usually mean data will not be available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While our research revealed a “negative result” with respect to new solution opportunities, the results are informative for how PLOS can best meet known researcher needs. This includes more closely partnering with established data repositories and improving the linking of research data and publications. These are important parts of our plans to support adoption of Open Science in 2021 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abstract for the talk is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurolib-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;neurolib&lt;/a&gt; is a computational framework for whole-brain modelling written in Python.
It provides a set of neural mass models that represent the average activity of a brain region on a mesoscopic scale.
In a whole-brain network model, brain regions are connected with each other based on structural connectivity data, i.e. the connectome of the brain.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurolib-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;neurolib&lt;/a&gt; can load structural and functional data sets, set up a whole-brain model, manage its parameters, simulate it, and organize its outputs for later analysis.
The activity of each brain region can be converted into a simulated &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BOLD&lt;/span&gt; signal in order to calibrate the model to empirical data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
Extensive model analysis is possible using a parameter exploration module, which allows to characterize the model’s behaviour given a set of changing parameters.
An optimization module allows for fitting a model to multimodal empirical data using an evolutionary algorithm.
Besides its included functionality, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurolib-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;neurolib&lt;/a&gt; is designed to be extendable such that custom neural mass models can be implemented easily.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurolib-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;neurolib&lt;/a&gt; offers a versatile platform for computational neuroscientists for prototyping models, managing large numerical experiments, studying the structure-function relationship of brain networks, and for in-silico optimization of whole-brain models.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Uppsala University and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced two 3-year publishing agreements that allow researchers to publish in PLOS journals without incurring article processing charges (APC). The Community Action Publishing (CAP) agreement enables Uppsala University researchers to publish fee-free in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; PLOS&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Biology. &lt;/em&gt;The Flat fee agreement also allows them to publish in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; and PLOS’ community journals&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. These models shift publishing costs from authors to research institutions based on prior publishing history and anticipated future growth with PLOS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are thrilled to be collaborating with Uppsala University, our first European flat fee customer, on two new models that allow Uppsala researchers to publish without APCs,” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS.  “As one of the most prestigious university’s in the world, Uppsala is well-positioned to further the cause of equitable and barrier free open reading and publishing and we are delighted to join with them on this effort.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS’ Community Action Publishing (CAP) is PLOS’ effort to sustain highly selective journal publishing without Article Processing Charges for authors. More details about the model can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/publish/publishing-faqs/#plos-community-action-publishing&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; PLOS’ Flat Fee model enables APC-free publishing with PLOS’ other five journals creating efficiency and reducing administrative overhead for managing gold APC funds. Uppsala University and PLOS will also collaborate on future data, metrics, and tools for institutions to evaluate Open Access publishing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Uppsala University publishing deal continues the momentum for PLOS, following other agreements with the University of California system, Big Ten Academic Alliance, Jisc (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester) and the Canadian Research Knowledge Network among others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;One way to think of culture is as a context in which we learn and develop. We share, live, perform, and experience culture through our participation in daily activities, customs, and routines with social others. Culture helps us make sense of our social worlds and shapes our actions, thoughts, and feelings. For example, culture plays a role in the way we experience emotions, construct our self-concepts, and learn and problem-solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With increasing migration and the movement of people in the twenty-first century, many children in the US and worldwide are attending school in formal settings where cultural norms and practices at home may conflict with those children encounter at school. This experience places children in the position of having to navigate two different social worlds—home and school. One broad question we can explore is: “what role does culture play in shaping children’s school experiences and academic success?” Let’s visit three specific areas: parental beliefs and socialization practices, teacher perceptions, and school curricula and children’s learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parental beliefs and socialization practices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parental expectations, beliefs, and attitudes about education shape children’s academic experiences. Many parents in diverse cultural communities view education as a path to future success. For example, as a group many Asian and Asian American children attain academic success. What role does culture play in these outcomes? &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=l4wwBgAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PA119&amp;amp;dq=Understanding+Taiwanese+children%E2%80%99s+play+via+constructing+and+reconstructing:+a+prospective+vision&amp;amp;ots=s3ofAeiKoG&amp;amp;sig=ocrn2krrERVpHnGg2WA_A4j09bI#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Understanding%20Taiwanese%20children%E2%80%99s%20play%20via%20constructing%20and%20reconstructing%3A%20a%20prospective%20vision&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;Chang&lt;/a&gt; notes that as a group, Chinese and Taiwanese parents place a high value on education. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207590544000068&quot;&gt;Kim and Park&lt;/a&gt;  note the same is true for Korean parents. Parenting approaches in these communities highlight training and disciplining children, parent self-sacrifice, and devotion to children. Parents believe perseverance and hard work is the key to success and socialization practices reinforce these values and traits. These cultural practices help children internalize the values their parents place upon education and behaving according to social norms. Children acquire these values and are loyal, appreciative, and dedicated to their parents for their support and encouragement. In part, they attain academic success to honor their parents and the broader social groups to which they belong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teacher perceptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers play an important role in children’s academic success too. What practices work best to motivate children to do well at school? The answer depends upon numerous factors. For example, many teachers will be entrusted with educating children who may not share their cultural heritage. How might this cultural mismatch shape children’s school experiences and potential for academic success?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most American school practices reflect dominant, mainstream American values, norms, and behavioral scripts. For most European American children who value independence and uniqueness, teacher praise and rewards can be highly motivating. However, for children who come from families that value humility and modesty, receiving praise in front of classmates might be an uncomfortable interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Student engagement norms are another example. Many American teachers using a mainstream cultural lens, connect active student engagement with student attentiveness. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/331021&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yamamoto and Li&lt;/a&gt;noted that for many Asian and Asian American students, knowing when to be quiet is a desirable skill which caregivers socialize their children to acquire. Teachers using mainstream, American cultural values and norms may perceive quiet students as disengaged and inattentive. These perceptions impact children’s motivation to learn and academic success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;School curricula and children’s learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominant, mainstream American values tend to permeate curricular and teaching practices. Many American schools promote individual learning and problem-solving approaches rather than group or collaborative problem-solving strategies. The focus upon individualized learning connects to the cultural ideology of individualism and the independent self. These approaches promote the self as separate and unique from social others. Many European American children participate in cultural practices and routines that reinforce this worldview and values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, many Latinx and indigenous children participate in cultural practices and activities at home that value group and collaborative problem solving. These practices connect to the cultural ideology of collectivism and the interdependent self. At home children participate in practices and routines that emphasize the importance of the group, especially family. Thus, there is a disconnect between the approaches at home with the practices and routines the child encounters at school. Consequently, many of these children often have difficulty reaching their maximum potential in classrooms that promote individual problem-solving skills. Why does this happen and does this necessarily have be the outcome?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many children from cultural heritages that promote collectivist values and an interdependent cultural model of the self, the cultural practices in which the child participates at home may conflict with those the child encounters at school. Often, teachers are unaware of these sources of conflict. However, this conflict between home and school does not need to impede students’ success or invalidate the child’s cultural heritage. One solution is for schools to meet students halfway and bridge the gap between the two contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two fine examples are &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.wested.org/resources/bridging-cultures-in-our-schools-new-approaches-that-work-knowledge-brief/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Bridging Cultures Project&lt;/a&gt; designed to assist immigrant and indigenous children in the US and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781351237109/chapters/10.4324/9781351237109-2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kamehameha Early Education Program (KEEP)&lt;/a&gt; designed to assist native Hawaiian children. Both programs highlight how helping teachers become more aware, respectful, accepting, and inclusive of all their students’ cultural values and goals shapes children’s motivation and academic success at school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous cultural forces connect to children’s school experiences and academic achievement. These include parental beliefs, socialization practices, and cultural worldviews. Cultural values, practices, and ways of learning at home both shape and connect to children’s formal school experiences. Educational initiatives such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.wested.org/project/bridging-cultures-project/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Bridging Cultures Project&lt;/a&gt;  and KEEP highlight the importance of cultural compatibility and connectedness in fostering children’s active engagement in school. Acknowledging and incorporating cultural knowledge, patterns, and ways of learning at home when they disconnect with those at school is one important way to ensure all children’s academic success.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Thank you to our volunteers. Your contributions throughout the past year have helped accelerate discovery and develop science during these unpredictable times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team at PLOS and the wider Open Science community are incredibly grateful for the thoughtfulness and expertise that you, our Editorial Board Members, Guest Editors and Reviewers, bring to your roles in the peer review process. Your rigorous assessment of submitted manuscripts is an invaluable contribution, and your ongoing commitment to Open Science inspires us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank You &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS’ Chief Scientific Officer, Veronique Kiermer’s message of thanks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;oembed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we achieve?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the past year our journal teams have worked to introduce new Open Access opportunities to support inclusivity, reproducibility and improving trust in science by involving more people in the scientific process. Our efforts aim to ensure a diverse and sustainable publishing ecosystem providing researchers of every career stage and discipline the chance to publish their findings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As of 2020 all PLOS journals now offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/how-can-we-partner/&quot;&gt;institutional partnership deals&lt;/a&gt; to equitably distribute the costs of publication and ensure that Open Science is really open for all. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ve empowered researchers to share more of their science with new &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/&quot;&gt;registered report submission&lt;/a&gt; options at &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; which introduces peer review at the experiment design stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The quality and breadth of PLOS research has enabled us to create new &lt;a href=&quot;https://collections.plos.org/about/&quot;&gt;curated editorial collections&lt;/a&gt; to advance a range of important fields.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-18640&quot; height=&quot;294&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/CTY-infographic-Gif_1_2.gif&quot; width=&quot;588&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;None of this would be possible without you, our dedicated Editorial Board Members, Guest Editors and Reviewers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coming soon…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we step into 2021 we will all undoubtedly come up against a unique set of challenges but rest assured, PLOS will continue to serve the Open Science community. Together we can ensure that researchers from all regions have every opportunity to share their work with experienced scientists from a host of disciplines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;Once again, &lt;strong&gt;THANK YOU&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;ALL &lt;/strong&gt;of our dedicated volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12279&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12279&quot; height=&quot;197&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/trends-300x197.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;from Samaras, et al. (2021)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking disease outbreaks is key to combating them, and predicting epidemics can help direct prevention measures most effectively. Google Trends has been used to track and/or predict the spread of infections diseases including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study extended these analyses to measles, a highly infectious disease causing outbreaks around the world, by comparing official data on measles in Europe to data from Google Trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that the prediction model generated from the Google Trends data overall closely matched the data on actual cases. The prediction was more accurate for countries that had higher measles activity. One advantage of using data from Google trends to track and predict disease outbreaks is that the data are available almost in real time, in contrast to official data that often take months to be released. This could help with faster responses to contain the spread of the illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccardiovascdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12872-020-01815-4?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Cardiovascular Disorders&lt;/em&gt;: Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction promotes myocardial angiogenesis and functional improvements in rat model of diabetic cardiomyopathy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12280 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/AdobeStock_4564432-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), a heart condition common in people with diabetes, is caused in part by a lack of blood vessel growth and repair in heart tissue. Growth factor therapy can promote angiogenesis to treat DCM, but delivery of the therapy has proven difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of this study tested ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) in rats with DCM as a potential safe and effective way to stimulate angiogenesis in the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that UTMD used with Sonovue microbubbles restored heart function in the rats who received the treatment. Histology and microscopy showed that much of the damage to the heart tissue seen in the DCM rats had been reversed by the treatment. This new technique shows promise as a noninvasive therapy for early intervention of DCM in diabetic patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;c-article-title&quot; data-test=&quot;article-title&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-021-03554-6?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt;:  Which growth standards should be used to identify large- and small-for-gestational age infants of mothers with type 1 diabetes? A pre-specified analysis of the CONCEPTT trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12281 size-medium alignright&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/Fotolia_349804_Subscription_XL-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babies born at either end of the birthweight bell curve are at higher risk of neonatal complications such as respiratory distress or NICU admission, but determining the cut-off precentile for considering a newborn at risk depends on a range of factors. Different standards account for these factors differently, leading to discrepancies in identifying babies at risk. Maternal diabetes is one of the factors that affect both a newborn’s birthweight and their risk of complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study has applied three widely-used growth standards to a large, international cohort of babies born to mothers with diabetes. Birthweight percentiles were calculated using each of the standards and then predicted risk of complications based on those percentiles was compared with actual outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors concluded that one of the growth standards, which did not account for gestational age at birth, was not suitable for risk assessment of babies born to mothers with diabetes, while the other two showed high associations between cut-offs for large- and small-for-gestational-age and rates of complications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12282 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/AdobeStock_141571612-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Falling is a serious risk for older adults, and falls-prevention exercise interventions have shown good results in preventing falls in the short-term. However, little is known about the long-term effects of these interventions and whether they produce ongoing changes in the exercise behaviors of the participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fill in these gaps, the authors of this study interviewed older adults who had participated in a fall-prevention exercise trial about their experiences in the trial and their exercise activities and falls after the conclusion of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants described maintaining physical activity since the conclusion of the trial, but very few continued with the exercises they had learned in the intervention. Many of the participants minimized the seriousness of falls they had experienced. These interviews highlighted that the challenges in encouraging older adults to continue with falls-prevention exercises after the conclusion of an intervention are similar to the challenges in convincing them to participate in the interventions in the first place. Those working with older adults need to understand individual needs and habits and to contextualize the importance of fall prevention within each individual’s own priorities for maintaining health and independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These clear guidelines will allow authors … to produce rigorous and comprehensive syntheses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta-ethnography, the synthesis of multiple qualitative studies, can provide insights into the experiences of patients and health-care professionals and generate evidence that can be used to inform healthcare practice and policy. However, there are not yet clear guidelines on the process of meta-ethnography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, the authors of a new paper have designed a step-by-step method for conducting a meta-ethnography, including examples. They especially focused on the middle and later stages of the process, “determining how the studies are related, translating the studies into one another, synthesising the translations,” due to the difficulty of these steps and the dearth of existing guidance for conducting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These clear guidelines will allow authors of future meta-ethnographies, even those new to the methodology, to produce rigorous and comprehensive syntheses of evidence that contribute to improvements in patient care and healthcare processes.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/02/12/restoration-of-the-daily-email-announcement/"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">
 &lt;p&gt;Subscribers to arXiv’s daily email announcement recently experienced a disruption in service. Maintenance performed by arXiv’s email provider was found to be the cause of the disruption. The issue has been resolved, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time, functionality on arXiv.org remained intact. Readers and authors could continue to browse and download new papers on arXiv.org, as well as submit their own articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The issue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily emails announcing new papers were received late, or not at all. Other emails, such as account registration confirmations, were also affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The response&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first identified and fixed a problem related to the email disruption, and began sending the email backlog to subscribers. Soon after that process began, another issue was identified that inadvertently truncated subscriber lists, specific to several subject areas. Finally, the distribution lists for all subject areas were restored and remaining announcements were sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, if any subscribers find that the daily announcement email is not received, we advise them &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe&quot;&gt;to resubscribe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remediation &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that researchers rely on the daily announcement for their work, and we aim to avoid such disruptions in the future by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automating daily backups of the distribution lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applying fixes to prevent the root cause&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving the monitoring of the daily email announcement systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviewing our overall backup and recovery plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appreciate our subscribers’ patience as we resolved the issue and, again, we apologize for any inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://brainupdate.nih.gov/2021/02/12/enhancing-and-maintaining-a-culture-of-inclusive-excellence-the-nih-faculty-institutional-recruitment-for-sustainable-transformation-first-program/"/>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A message to the community from the Directors of the Institutes, Centers, and Offices involved in the NIH BRAIN Initiative and NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-3042&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NINDS Director Walter J. Koroshetz, NIMH Director Joshua A. Gordon, NIA Director Richard Hodes, NIDA Director Nora D. Volkow, NCATS Director Christopher P. Austin, NICHD Director Diana W. Bianchi, NEI Director Michael F. Chiang, NIDCR Director Rena D’Souza, NIAAA Director George F. Koob, NCCIH Director Helene Langevin, NIH BRAIN Initiative Director John J. Ngai, OBSSR Director William T. Riley, NIBIB Director Bruce J. Tromberg, NIDCD Director Debara L. Tucci, NIEHS Director Rick Woychik, NINR Director Shannon N. Zenk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inherent in the mission of NIH is that biomedical research and its application can and should benefit all people. Significant events across our nation over the past year and frank discussions in the research community have led to deep reflection at NIH about biases and disparities faced by underrepresented groups in the research enterprise. As we strive to recognize our own role in these challenges, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html&quot;&gt;affirm our commitment to diversity&lt;/a&gt; and to positive change to eliminate racism in our community and in our organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a step towards that change, the NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices that are part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;the NIH BRAIN Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, strongly encourage the neuroscience community to take advantage of the new NIH-wide &lt;a href=&quot;https://commonfund.nih.gov/first&quot;&gt;Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (FIRST) Program&lt;/a&gt;, supported by the NIH Common Fund. Although progress has been made to increase participation of historically underrepresented groups in biomedical training stages, members of these groups are still less likely to be hired into positions as independently funded faculty researchers. These populations include underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help address this disparity, the FIRST program aims to enhance cultures of inclusive excellence through institutional support for recruitment of diverse “cohorts” of early-stage research faculty. Here, “inclusive excellence” describes the cultivation of scientific environments that can engage and benefit from a full range of talent. Neuroscience continues to be one of the fastest growing areas of biomedical research. We want the FIRST program to enable researchers to thrive, and we believe the broader neuroscience community has much to gain. Indeed, the growing field of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://diversity.nih.gov/find-read-learn/diversity-research-articles&quot;&gt;Science of Diversity&lt;/a&gt; shows the positive impacts that result when heterogeneous teams apply diverse perspectives and expertise to research challenges. We are hopeful that the cohort hiring model in FIRST will succeed in turning the culture in neuroscience departments and their institutions toward greater inclusion and diversity. We fully recognize that there are structural barriers perpetuated by gaps and that critical improvements must be made, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuronline.sfn.org/diversity/fostering-diversity-and-inclusion-in-neuroscience-faculty&quot;&gt;many groups are severely underrepresented in neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;. To our neuroscientists: we encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity as a path to meaningful change. We are committed to fostering a more inclusive, equitable, and diverse neuroscience community, and the FIRST program is a step in the right direction, with many, many more steps to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objectives of the FIRST program are twofold: to &lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-20-022.html&quot;&gt;support institutions in hiring diverse cohort&lt;/a&gt;s of early stage research faculty; and to transform culture at NIH-funded extramural institutions by building a community of scientists who are committed to diversity and inclusive excellence. In addition to funds for hiring, the program will support new and strengthened institution-wide approaches to facilitating the success of cohort members and future faculty from diverse backgrounds. For cohort members, this is likely to include mentoring, sponsorship, and networking opportunities. For institutions, this may include training faculty in approaches known to foster inclusive excellence and changing the rubric for interviewing processes. The FIRST program will also &lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-20-023.html&quot;&gt;fund a coordination and evaluation center&lt;/a&gt;, which will develop and guide the collection of common data metrics to rigorously assess the effects of FIRST faculty cohorts and institutional activities on the research culture at funded institutions. Lessons learned by these institutions will be shared with the broader biomedical research community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FIRST program is expected to fund 12 awards over the next three years, plus the coordination and evaluation center, with an estimated budget of $241M over nine years, contingent upon the availability of funds. The first receipt date for the program’s funding opportunities is &lt;strong&gt;March 1, 2021. &lt;/strong&gt;For more information, please also view the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://nci.rev.vbrick.com/#/events/a3aee724-a9e7-45fd-ba2d-bef6ca56de9f&quot;&gt;technical assistance webinar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Phantom limb is a condition in which someone who has lost a part of their body (e.g., due to amputation) continues to experience phantom sensations coming from the missing body part.

&lt;p&gt;En hel dag, med några korta pauser, tog det att presentera grundpelare och huvudteman för det nya ramprogrammet för EU-forskning, Horisont Europa (#HorizonEurope). Presentationen arrangerades gemensamt av 6 stora svenska finansiärer; Energimyndigheten, FORMAS, Forte, Rymdstryrelsen, Vetenskapsrådet, och Vinnova. Många bra presentationer och panelsamtal! Jag har summerat det hela &lt;a data-id=&quot;https://wakelet.com/wake/J0Bmo2UaMo3i03wWd8WUp&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; href=&quot;https://wakelet.com/wake/J0Bmo2UaMo3i03wWd8WUp&quot;&gt;i tweets här&lt;/a&gt;, men det finns en del att lyfta upp som inte ryms i kortfattade meningar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Öppen vetenskap nämndes EN gång (av John Tumpane, från FORMAS). Data-delning nämndes inte alls. Samverkan däremot nämndes upprepade gånger, framför allt med fokus på industrin. Standarder nämndes i förbifarten, framför allt som något viktigt för industrin att bevaka och delta i utvecklandet av.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mycket av fokus låg på “partnerships”, arrangerade och finansierade strategiska multi-partssamarbeten som är menade att ge garanterad förutsägbar nytta. Hela 50% av budgeten går dit. Partnerships är inte nya för EU, men det utökade fokuset på nytta är en lite ändrad inriktning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;En nyhet för det här ramprogrammet är “&lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/info/horizon-europe/missions-horizon-europe_en&quot;&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt;“, övergripande målbilder som ska vara förankrade i samhällsbehov och ge samhällsnytta, och göra det lättare att nå målen för the European Green Deal och Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan såväl som hållbarhetsmålen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forskningsinfrastrukturer nämndes en hel del i början av samtalet (det är en av pelarna), och får en hyfsad andel av budgeten, men var inte särskilt närvarande när det kom till samverkans-diskussionen (där jag tycker de absolut passar in).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regioner nämndes som möjliga innovationshubbar och koordinatorer, vilket var en trevlig ny vinkel – tidigare har jag mest hört regioner nämnas som trösklar och fragmentering, och ett problem för det svenska Life Science-ekosystemet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Universitet nämndes i början – när vikten av rätt utbildning och mobilitet i utbildning diskuterades – men inte explicit i senare diskussioner om samverkan; där låg fokus mest på individuella forskare och på industrin. Universitet borde rimligen också vara nyckelmedlemmar i samverkansprojekt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Två viktiga gap (”valleys of death”) i kunskapsöverföring och nyttogörande  nämndes: den slingrande vägen  som krävs för att ta forskning från labbet till industrin, och svårigheten att skala upp innovativa start-ups på ett hållbart sätt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regeringen håller på och arbetar ut en nationell strategi för Sveriges deltagande i Horisont Europa, det är dock ännu oklart exakt när den kommer vara klar. Det ska bli intressant att se vad den innehåller; EU-ansökningar anses allmänt vara tunga, arbetskrävande och komplicerade. Stödbidrag för att frigöra tid att sätta ihop en ansökan vore kanske användbart. Utökat stöd från universitetens administratörer och Grant Offices också. (När jag jobbade med mitt första EU-projekt hade vi en EU-kunnig administratör till hjälp, och vilken &lt;em&gt;skillnad&lt;/em&gt; det gjorde). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tydligen hade Norge sin motsvarande presentation &lt;a data-id=&quot;https://vimeo.com/472252181/f6efee79c0&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/472252181/f6efee79c0&quot;&gt;redan i höstas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Reinoud Maex will talk about a paper &quot;Packaging Life: The Origin of Ion-Selective Channels&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most articles dealing with early life focus on its chemical basis and the
evolution of proteins, RNA, DNA, and other metabolic products. This essay,
however, is concerned primarily with the energy required to produce and
maintain the essential life chemicals, and the necessity to confine them in a
cell where they can function cooperatively. It seems likely that life evolved
in proximity to the undersea vents discovered by the submersible craft Alvin
of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (Woods Hole, MA). Bacteria were
probably the original life form, growing in mats near the vents. Some
advantages of the vents as starting points for life are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;arabic simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plentiful water and essential ions. We are ~60% salt water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Plenty of chemical elements, many out of equilibrium and ready to
combine. From one point of view, chemistry is simply the search of
electrons, e.g., the two around a hydrogen molecule, for vacancies
as close as possible to a nucleus with many protons, e.g., oxygen,
or less avid electron gatherers, e.g., nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, or
phosphorus. Eighteen of the 20 AAs contain only hydrogen, carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen; and the remaining two require sulfur in
addition. DNA and RNA require, in addition, phosphorus. In short, it
is not necessary to dip far into the periodic table to make most of
the life chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Energy can be derived from combining chemicals issuing from the vent, as
in a fuel cell, which derives energy by passing electrons from
hydrogen to oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. The water near a vent is warm, speeding experiments in the evolution of
life chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these essentials, it is easy to imagine that life developed over a period
of time, say a billion years. J. D. Sutherland, who first succeeded in
synthesizing RNA, was quoted as saying: ‘‘My assumption is that we are here on
this planet as a fundamental consequence of organic chemistry.So it must be
chemistry that wants to work’’ (1). This essay starts at the point where early
chemistry has done its work. It deals with the packaging of the life chemicals,
the problems that arise from packaging, and energy production.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h6&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Lauren Cadwallader&lt;/em&gt;, PLOS’ Open Research Manager&lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lack of reproducibility of research findings is a continuing concern in modern science.  Code reproducibility is a central part of the problem and we have been exploring code notebooks as one potential solution. We need to understand if these are of value to our community, both readers and authors of computational research, and are asking the computational research community to &lt;a href=&quot;https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6147858/Interactive-Code-Notebooks-Survey&quot;&gt;share their views&lt;/a&gt; on the most important aspects of sharing code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Collaborating on code &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have been exploring opportunities for collaboration with community-focused tools, such as code notebooks, that can improve open, reproducible research practices. PLOS Computational Biology is investigating how we can improve the reproducibility of computational articles in collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neurolibre.com/&quot;&gt;NeuroLibre&lt;/a&gt;, a Canadian-based open science group supported by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://conp.ca/&quot;&gt;Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform&lt;/a&gt;. Code notebooks are documents that contain code, the dependencies needed to run the code and reader friendly text elements, such as paragraphs of text explaining the purpose of the code block and figure captions. These notebooks can be made interactive through the ability to change parameters in figures or edit the code itself.  Notebooks improve open science practices by removing barriers faced by researchers who try to access others’ code, such as setting up the correct environment to run the code, making it simpler to interrogate code underlying the figures in a paper by presenting the code, the resulting analyses and accompanying text in a browser-based notebook. The Computational Biology community is a  logical place to explore how valuable these are since the community already shows high engagement with making code accessible, although primarily via repositories&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NeuroLibre has created prototype versions of code notebooks for two published PLOS Computational Biology articles. They took the code and data that were shared with the articles and turned them into browser-based notebooks that display the figures, with the ability to switch to view the code or to view a Jupyter notebook (hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybinder.org/&quot;&gt;Binder&lt;/a&gt;). While a base level of interactivity can be created without input from the papers’ authors, the NeuroLibre team worked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://notebook-factory.github.io/BayesianRepetoireOverlap/01Introduction/intro.html&quot;&gt;one of the papers&lt;/a&gt;’ authors to create additional interactive figures. These extra features  allow readers to manipulate the underlying data in a different way thanks to author input, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://notebook-factory.github.io/BayesianRepetoireOverlap/03Code/Fig3_final.html&quot;&gt;choosing intermediate sample sizes&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to the three sample sizes detailed in the published paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;351&quot; src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/T4Do4lvQDevPbvaG4UopRqwqvmDvHN-WRwMSmv9sg6LPkdMsP_YXlPMwTSJvosvBiDDbXgzqkAxS0qtJQAt2nccCVENPh00dD3XeKDvT6blBtadYqbZkMse6_m1UFtNcLGGnhq-c&quot; width=&quot;624&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The sample size in the interactive plot can be changed using the dropdown box to the top left of the plot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;What are we up to?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our collaboration with NeuroLibre to date has focused on gathering qualitative user feedback on the prototypes, to understand  the value of these notebooks to computational biology researchers. A series of seven initial interviews helped us to better understand how researchers currently manage and share their code, how and why they access other peoples’ code, and if we are asking the right questions about notebooks. Amongst other things, we are interested in hearing what aspects of publishing reproducible research researchers value the most, what challenges they encounter, and what considerations there are for creating an interactive notebook alongside a published paper. Informed by the outcomes of this initial research, we are now looking for more researchers to share their views on these prototypes via an online questionnaire. This will serve as useful feedback for NeuroLibre to continue improving their tools, and support PLOS in working towards improving reproducibility in research publishing, in collaboration with the scientific community. &lt;br /&gt;If you work in computational biology related research, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6147858/Interactive-Code-Notebooks-Survey&quot;&gt;share your views&lt;/a&gt;! Anonymous results of the survey will be made available in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This was originally posted on the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://incf.org&quot;&gt;INCF&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.cnsorg.org&quot;&gt;OCNS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/pages/about.html&quot;&gt;Software Working Group (WG)&lt;/a&gt;'s blog &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/2021/02/07/dev-session-ankur-sinha-neurofedora.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
It is a great opportunity to learn how &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://ankursinha.in&quot;&gt;Ankur Sinha&lt;/a&gt; will introduce the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/user-liberation-watch-and-share-our-new-video/&quot;&gt;Free/Open Source Software&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; project and discuss its development in this developer session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date: Feb 16, 2021 1700 UTC (Click &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Dev+session%3A+Ankur+Sinha%3A+NeuroFedora&amp;amp;iso=20210216T17&amp;amp;p1=136&amp;amp;ah=1&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;  to see your local time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location (Zoom): &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://ucl.zoom.us/j/94964460359?pwd=MTJmWEY1NHRxd3l4ZGdtTS9NQ1FaZz09&quot;&gt;https://ucl.zoom.us/j/94964460359?pwd=MTJmWEY1NHRxd3l4ZGdtTS9NQ1FaZz09&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abstract for the talk is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is an initiative to provide a ready to use Fedora based Free/Open source software platform for neuroscience.
We believe that similar to Free software, science should be free for all to use, share, modify, and study.
The use of Free software also aids reproducibility, data sharing, and collaboration in the research community.
By making the tools used in the scientific process easier to use, NeuroFedora aims to take a step to enable this ideal.
In this session, I will talk about the deliverables of the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; project and then go over the complete pipeline that we use to produce, test, and disseminate them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/obese-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have several anti-smoking policies in the UK in recent decades – the bans on indoor/workplace smoking, tobacco adverts around sports, and tobacco sales in vending machines, to name a few. Indeed, smoking has been the major target of public health interventions, and rightfully so given that it made the largest contribution to avoidable deaths. These public health interventions have been quite successful and, as a result, the number of smokers has been decreasing over the past 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more people with obesity and fewer who smoke, it is now of question whether smoking remains the top contributor to UK’s deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while smoking became less popular, we had more people with obesity. In 2003, 23% of people in England had obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and the number rises to 29% in 2017. Similar trends can also be observed in other nations in the UK. With more people with obesity and fewer who smoke, it is now of question whether smoking remains the top contributor to UK’s deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We answered this question in our research by synthesizing two sets of numbers. The first set is the yearly proportions of people with different levels of obesity, and those of current, former, and never smokers. We extracted these numbers from the Health Surveys for England and Scottish Health Surveys. These surveys recruited random samples of people in England and Scotland, making their findings more representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second set of numbers is what we called the risk ratios of obesity and smoking. Risk ratios quantify to which extent people with obesity and smokers are at higher risk of adverse health events, such as death. We extracted risk ratios from the latest meta-analysis studies, which should provide more robust estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12249&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12249&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/picblog-300x250.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Frederick K Ho et. al BMC Public Health&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining these two sets of numbers, we found that smoking contributed 23% of all deaths in 2003, and that number decreased to 19% in 2017 (Figure). Meanwhile obesity contributed 18% deaths in 2003 and that number increased to 23% in 2017. The contribution of obesity exceeded that of smoking in 2013. The general trends were consistent across age, sex, and education level. But for younger people under 45 years of age, smoking remained the larger contributor to deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should, however, be noted that the analysis assumed the risk ratios could accurately reflect the extent to which obesity and smoking causes death over the 15 years. In addition, our study only considered deaths, but the impact of obesity and smoking extends to chronic illnesses and disabilities. The legacy of smoking, such as vaping, electronic cigarettes, and passive smoking, have also not been accounted for. These can be further investigated when better and more recent data are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our analysis estimated obesity is now contributing to more deaths than smoking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historical efforts to protect the public from the harms of smoking have been successful. Our analysis estimated obesity is now contributing to more deaths than smoking, which highlights the need to focus our efforts to address it. This could include government policies and legislation to create an environment that can facilitate weight management, as well as interventions to support individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
