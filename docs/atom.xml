 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This post is a request for comments on the preprint &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/m2bce/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Data Repository Selection: Criteria That Matter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; via this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyurl.com/RepoCriteriaFeedback&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; online form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; on behalf of the authors of the preprint (full list available there)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;At PLOS we have long advocated for and developed data policies to ensure that datasets, as well as other digital products associated with articles, are deposited and made accessible via appropriate repositories and platforms. Research questions, study design, and data all contribute to the full and accurate story of science. These policies are also, since 2016, informed by the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) Data Principles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The organizations &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fairsharing.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;FAIRsharing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datacite.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;DataCite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; have joined forces with a group of publisher representatives (authors of this work, including PLOS) to propose a set of criteria that are important for the identification and selection of data repositories, which can be recommended to researchers when they are preparing to publish the data underlying their findings. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This work aims to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;reduce complexity for researchers when preparing submissions to journals &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;increase efficiency for data repositories that currently have to work with multiple publishers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;simplify the process of recommending data repositories for publishers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This work aims to make the implementation of research data policies more efficient and consistent and improve approaches to data sharing by promoting the use of community-approved reliable data repositories. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Researchers who generate and reuse data are key stakeholders in the research data lifecycle. However, the first target audience for this work is other journals and publishers, repository developers and maintainers, certification and evaluation initiatives, and other policymakers.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We invite you to read the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/m2bce/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;preprint &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;that describes the work, its motivation, its relations to other initiatives, and provide feedback via this &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyurl.com/RepoCriteriaFeedback&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The abstract is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work shows that fillers - short utterances like &quot;ehm&quot; and &quot;uhm&quot; - allow one to predict whether someone is above median along the Big-Five personality traits. The experiments have been performed over a corpus of 2,988 fillers uttered by 120 different speakers in spontaneous conversations. The results show that the prediction accuracies range between 74% and 82% depending on the particular trait. The proposed approach includes a feature selection step - based on Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms - that has been used to detect the personality markers, i.e., the subset of the features that better account for the prediction outcomes and, indirectly, for the personality of the speakers. The results show that only a relatively few features tend to be consistently selected, thus acting as reliable personality markers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) can help patients with Parkinson’s control their movement — but a new study has found that it also prevents some people from being able to swim.&lt;/strong&gt; Nine patients — including two former competitive swimmers — were no longer able to keep afloat after receiving implants for DBS, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/parkinsons-patients-are-mysteriously-losing-the-ability-to-swim-after&quot;&gt;reports Jennifer Walter for &lt;em&gt;Discover&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Past research has found that DBS can also disrupt other learned motor skills, such as golfing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38643&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A ketamine-based intervention could help heavy drinkers cut down on their alcohol consumption, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/11/ketamine-disrupts-memories-help-heavy-drinkers-cut-back1&quot;&gt;reports Kelly Servick at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers gave drinkers a single dose of ketamine, with the aim of disrupting the associations they had formed between the sights and smells of beer and the reward they got from consuming it. Months later, the participants were drinking far fewer pints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“All humans have biases – simplified ways of thinking when we need to process our thoughts quickly. Accent is no exception: we all have automatic associations with accents based on people we’ve met during our lives. It’s only when we rely on these simple stereotypes to judge unrelated traits, like intelligence or competence, that our cultural baggage becomes discrimination.” &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/british-people-still-think-some-accents-are-smarter-than-others-what-that-means-in-the-workplace-126964&quot;&gt;Devyani Sharma writes about her research&lt;/a&gt; into people’s perceptions of different British accents — and how these attitudes can lead to prejudice against those who are already marginalised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being hungry doesn’t automatically make us more angry, despite the popular belief in “hanger”&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/health/food-anger-emotion-psychology.html&quot;&gt;writes Benedict Carey at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Research has found that people only become hangry in circumstances where they (mis)interpret the unpleasantness of huger as a feeling of annoyance towards others. And, as we reported recently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/11/when-were-hungry-we-remain-surprisingly-helpful-and-co-operative/&quot;&gt;even very hungry people remain surprisingly helpful and co-operative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study out this week led to a bunch of outlets proclaiming that one in four teenagers are “addicted” to their phones — but the real story is much more nuanced than that&lt;/strong&gt;. At &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2225248-teens-arent-addicted-to-their-phones-but-we-like-to-think-they-are/&quot;&gt;Clare Wilson explores why so much of the media coverage got it wrong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing lecture notes out by hand may have benefits over computer-based &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;note-taking&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191122-when-the-best-way-to-take-notes-is-by-hand&quot;&gt;writes Claudia Hammond for &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Studies have shown that students who write their notes are better at explaining the concepts they are learning about, seemingly because pen-and-paper note-taking involves a deeper form of cognitive processing than simply typing out a lecturer’s words verbatim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, it’s Black Friday today, and whatever you think about the day, there’s no denying the fact that it has become firmly established on this side of the pond in recent years. &lt;/strong&gt;But if you want to wise up to the tricks used by retailers to get you to buy, look no further than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zrcbf4j&quot;&gt;this explainer from &lt;em&gt;BBC Bitesize&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;VR has become affordable and accessible to consumers. Neuroscience research can benefit from the tight control of visual and auditory stimuli and the immersion that VR can afford. I compiled a list of the opportunities that cheap, commodity VR headsets bring to human neuroscience. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;What can you do with VR?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7183&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7183&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;screenshot-from-2019-11-27-20-18-07&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/screenshot-from-2019-11-27-20-18-07-e1574904029917.png?w=748&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/screenshot-from-2019-11-27-20-18-07-e1574904029917.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/screenshot-from-2019-11-27-20-18-07-e1574904029917.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1018,771&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/screenshot-from-2019-11-27-20-18-07/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/screenshot-from-2019-11-27-20-18-07-e1574904029917.png?w=748&quot; /&gt;Navigating in a virtual garden – from Tarr and Warren 2002.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The graphics in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12403993&quot;&gt;this 2002 review&lt;/a&gt; are dated, but the content is still relevant for today. VR has remained in use in neuroscience, typically:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Navigation and memory: blocked light VR can be used to simulate navigation in different environments, either on a treadmill or in large empty room. We can study people’s navigation strategies, how cognitive maps develop, or how uncontrolled changes in the environment can hurt memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visual psychophysics&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep37016&quot;&gt;: VR allows the precise presentation of binocular visual stimuli&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Body representations and illusions: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3122&quot;&gt;we can study body representations by modifying how one’s body is rendered&lt;/a&gt;. We can also create convincing representations of an arm that has been amputated or create full-body illusions. It’s even possible to change one’s body representation to that of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613976/a-vr-illusion-that-makes-us-think-we-have-a-spiders-body-could-change-gaming/&quot;&gt;an animal with a different body plan and study how representations evolve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Motor learning: thanks to precise tracking, we can study how complex motor skills are acquired and evolve over time. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rehabilitation and clinical research: stroke survivors can benefit from immersion in a virtual environment where their loss of function is not readily visible. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3122&quot;&gt;Burn victims feel pain relief by immersing themselves in a cool environment&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1545968317751677&quot;&gt;People with visual hemi-neglect can benefit from a functional evaluation in an ecologically relevant environment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Consumer hardware&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s really changed is the new opportunities brought by cheap consumer and prosumer headsets. I’m talking specifically about headsets with 6 degrees of freedom (6dof) tracking, that track both the orientation and the position of the hand, and are available for anywhere between 500 and 3000$ US. These headsets come in a variety of shapes and sizes, with some popular examples including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Oculus Quest All-in-one VR Gaming Headset - 128GB - Windows - Oculus Quest - 128GB Edition&quot; src=&quot;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71D9OsZmWxL._SX679_.jpg&quot; /&gt;The Oculus Quest standalone VR product&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oculus.com/quest/?locale=en_US&quot;&gt;The Oculus Quest&lt;/a&gt;. This standalone headset doesn’t require a computer and can be carried in a cereal-box-sized carrying case with a total weight of less than 2 lbs. That makes it the most portable 6dof headset on the market right now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oculus.com/rift-s/&quot;&gt;Oculus Rift S&lt;/a&gt; and Windows MR headsets such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/hmd/windows-mixed-reality/hmd-odyssey-windows-mixed-reality-headset-xe800zba-hc1us/&quot;&gt;Samsung Odyssey&lt;/a&gt;, which are tethered to a computer with a beefy GPU. These use inside-out tracking, which means there’s no extra equipment (i.e. lighthouses) to install. They can be still be somewhat mobile with a gaming laptop. Access to a beefy GPU, however, means development can be easier because we are not resource-constrained.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex&quot;&gt;Valve Index&lt;/a&gt;, a higher end headset with controllers that don’t need to be constantly gripped, allowing a larger range of applications when looking a motor skill acquisition. This one requires lighthouses and therefore is not very portable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://enterprise.vive.com/ca/product/vive-pro-eye/&quot;&gt;HTC Vive Pro Eye&lt;/a&gt;. This brings eye tracking to the table, important for visual neuroscience applications. It also supports affordable foot representation and representing real objects in the virtual world with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vive.com/eu/vive-tracker/&quot;&gt;extra trackers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/em&gt;: I worked for Oculus Research/FRL for two years, so I’m more familiar with Oculus products. Please mention it if I’ve missed an important piece of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These can be connected to many accessories that can potentially improve the range of opportunities, for instance treadmills, external tracking sensors for full body tracking, and devices that bring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leapmotion.com/&quot;&gt;hand presence without controllers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What does VR commodification mean for the lab?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Better tools&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many old reviews of VR in neuroscience state that the tools are hard to use. I dinstinctly remember sitting in an undergrad class well over ten years ago with &lt;a href=&quot;https://douglas.research.mcgill.ca/veronique-bohbot&quot;&gt;Dr. Veronique Bohbot&lt;/a&gt; sharing how she struggled with Unreal tournament to implement an 8-arm maze.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7187&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7187&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/image.png?w=748&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/image.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/image.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;2072,1092&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/image.png?w=1024&quot; /&gt;Valem developing a Beat Saber clone in Unity&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tools have come a long way since then. To give you a concrete example of this, this tutorial shows Valem &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh4k0Q1Pl7E&quot;&gt;making a Beat Saber clone in VR in Unity3d in 10 minutes&lt;/a&gt;! Experiences can be developed in a GUI and immediately tried on a development PC. They’re accessible for someone with a programming background, and are often free for personal or academic use. The most commonly used tools are game engines with support for VR experiences:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unity.com/&quot;&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt;, which is programmed in C# and is quite approachable for beginners. There is a framework built on top of Unity called &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-019-01242-0&quot;&gt;the Unity Experiment Framework&lt;/a&gt; to help create human behaviour experiments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/&quot;&gt;Unreal Engine&lt;/a&gt;, which is scripted in C++. It tends to have a steeper learning curve but the rendering is top-notch, which can be important for immersion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are tools that are built especially for researchers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldviz.com/vizard-virtual-reality-software&quot;&gt;Vizard is a research platform&lt;/a&gt; that allows one to script experiences in Python. It has plugins for a lot of specialized research-grade hardware (extra trackers, data gloves) and has comprehensive data management features built-in, e.g. replaying interactions, processing data in realtime with numpy/scipy, and streaming data out in realtime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more specialized visual psychophysics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychopy.org/api/visual/rift.html&quot;&gt;PsychoPy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://psychtoolbox.org/docs/PsychVRToolbox&quot;&gt;Psychtoolbox&lt;/a&gt; support the Oculus Rift, Rift S and the Quest via the Oculus Link. Rounding out the picture is WebVR and frameworks built on top of it like &lt;a href=&quot;https://aframe.io/&quot;&gt;aframe&lt;/a&gt;, which allow VR content to be authored in HTML and delivered via a web browser. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;More content&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Programmers and grad students don’t often have a background in 3d modeling. Nevertheless, complex environments and situations can be created with existing tools. The Unity store contains a wide range of free assets for download, from trees to grass textures to fully developed games. &lt;a href=&quot;https://poly.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Poly showcases pre-built objects&lt;/a&gt; that can be readily imported into Unity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.esri.com/content/dam/esrisites/en-us/arcgis/products/city-engine/assets/city-engine-tabcontent-5-steps-3-add-3d.jpg&quot; /&gt;A city generated from within &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/esri-cityengine/overview&quot;&gt;CityEngine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The content can be personalized to the subject to make it emotionally  salient when that’s relevant. If you’re studying navigation, for example, you can recreate the neighborhood or even the whole city you’re in, complete with buildings and textures, with tools like CityEngine and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citygen3d.com/&quot;&gt;CityGen3d&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Subjects themselves may have emotionally salient content that they can use, in particular 360 degree panoramas which can be taken with commodity mobile phones. I remember vividly the first time I viewed a panorama taken in Sequoia National Park three years prior – I felt transported. I cried. This is exactly the kind of stimuli you’d want if you’re studying the interaction of emotion, memory, and navigation, and it had been sitting in my Google Photos for 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7190&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7190&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Nexus 5&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;1429295129&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;pano_20150417_182239&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/pano_20150417_182239.jpg?w=748&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/pano_20150417_182239.jpg?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/pano_20150417_182239.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;10415,1536&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/pano_20150417_182239/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/pano_20150417_182239.jpg?w=1024&quot; /&gt;Sequoia National Park. My photo,&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3d scanning and 360 degree cameras also allow content to be created. There’s a big ecosystem of tools to create VR content so students and postdocs don’t have to become artists to make their experiments work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Better apps&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Beat Saber splash page&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f-td44JfPbcZ9C8VFzUOZNwUTDc=/0x0:780x439/1200x800/filters:focal(540x73:664x197)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65779656/EKVBFK7WoAAuRaM.0.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://beatsaber.com/&quot;&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;VR has already had its first million seller with Beat Saber. Hundreds of available VR games and experiences can potentially be used fruitfully in neuroscience research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cneuromod?lang=en&quot;&gt;The Courtois Neuromod project&lt;/a&gt; aims to record hundreds of hours of fMRI and MEG data from a dozen subjects. Subjects play 16-bit era games in a scanner, engaging a wide range of cognitive processes: visual and auditory sensory, planning, 2d navigation, reward, motor commands, etc. This turns the concept of gamification on its head: the game is the experiment. The subjects don’t fall asleep, and do they do actions which are ecologically relevant. VR games could add to the mix 3d navigation, locomotion, embodiment, tool use, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One issue with applying this to VR game is that researchers will want to have access to the source code to hook into existing games and export useful information, e.g. position of the hands, head, and world. Many clones of popular games  are available on the Unity Store, with their source, for a pittance. Researchers may also consider reaching out to game development studios to add features to their games to allow this exporting, or even to develop games made for research from the ground up, as the success of Sea &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seaheroquest.com/site/en/&quot;&gt;Hero Quest&lt;/a&gt; shows. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;At-home experiments&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Installing VR has become much simpler with inside out tracking. That’s especially the case with the Oculus Quest, which doesn’t require a computer. It’s not impossible to think of lending a subject a headset for a multi-day task, for example to look at learning effects in visual or motor tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can think of it as a smaller scale version of crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. Here, however, the hardware is tightly controlled. This could be especially useful for people studying rehabilitation, e.g. in the case of stroke – the progression of rehabilitation can be tracked every day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;VR commodification means is that you don’t have to be a &lt;em&gt;VR lab&lt;/em&gt; to do VR in your lab. Development is straightforward and the equipment is cheap, so it can be integrated as one component into a larger project. That offers many  new opportunities for enterprising labs to learn more about the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/digital-detoxes-are-a-solution-looking-for-a-problem-106460&quot;&gt;digital detoxes&lt;/a&gt; to the recent Silicon Valley fad of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/11/13/20959424/dopamine-fasting-silicon-valley-trend-neuroscience&quot;&gt;dopamine fasting&lt;/a&gt;”, it seems more fashionable than ever to attempt to abstain from consuming digital media. Underlying all of these trends is the assumption that using digital devices — and being on social media in particular — is somehow unhealthy, and that if we abstain, we might become happier, more fulfilled people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is there any truth to this belief? When it comes to social media, at least, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15213269.2019.1688171&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Media Psychology &lt;/em&gt;suggests not.  In one of the few experimental studies in the field, researchers have found that quitting social media for up to four weeks does nothing to improve our well-being or quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38626&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many past psychological studies into social media have relied on correlational data, looking at how individual differences in social media use (&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/02/researchers-find-the-most-plausible-cause-of-wellbeing-decline-in-youth-is-increased-screen-time/&quot;&gt;or “screen time” more generally&lt;/a&gt;) relate to well-being. That makes sense: it’s far easier to look at existing patterns of use than to conduct a controlled experiment, particularly in a world where we are all using digital media every day. But it also makes it hard to separate out cause-and-effect — even if social media use is associated with poorer well-being, how can we be sure that already unhappy people are not simply using social media more often, for instance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in their new study, Jeffrey Hall and colleagues at the University of Kansas decided to add to the fairly sparse experimental literature by looking at what happens when people actively avoid using social media. The researchers assigned participants to one of five groups: one was told to simply continue using social media as normal (specifically Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram), while the others were told to abstain from all four platforms for periods of 7, 14, 21 or 28 days. The researchers set up accounts to follow each participant and check that they were not posting or engaging with other people’s posts during this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of each day for the entire four week period, participants recorded the proportion of time they had spent doing various activities (e.g. eating, working, watching TV, using the internet and so on). They also completed short questionnaires measuring well-being, quality of life and loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After excluding those who had used social media during the days they were supposed to abstain, the researchers were left with 130 participants. They then fed all of the participants’ data into statistical models, to figure out whether there were any differences in the measures of well-being between abstinence and control days, and if so, whether these effects depended on how long people abstained for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the team found that there were no significant effects, regardless of how many weeks participants were off social media. “[D]ays when participants were free to use four types of social media and days when they abstained from using social media were indistinguishable in terms of end of day loneliness, affective well-being, and quality of day,” they conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding is not entirely surprising. The results of the few other experimental studies conducted so far have been mixed: abstaining from social media (or decreasing use) has resulted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751&quot;&gt;small reductions in loneliness&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30334650&quot;&gt;greater “cravings” to be back online&lt;/a&gt;, but also a lack of significant effects on several other measures of well-being. Taken together, these findings suggest that “correlational research that reports a negative influence of social media should be interpreted with greater scrutiny,” write the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study is not without limitations: in particular, the sample size wasn’t huge, and the authors acknowledge that they did not have enough participants to detect any small effects that might have been present. On the other hand, if abstaining from social media does produce tiny effects that are only apparent when looking across massive samples, then those effects might have &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/31/link-between-teens-time-on-digital-devices-and-lower-wellbeing-is-too-small-to-merit-substantial-scientific-discussion/&quot;&gt;little practical relevance in the real world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more importantly, the researchers had no way of making sure people were not passively using social media on their abstinence days, scrolling through their Twitter or Instagram feeds without actually posting anything themselves, for example. And while the study indicates that quitting social media may &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; be of little psychological benefit, it’s unclear whether certain individuals might get more out of abstaining than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the research does suggest that panics linking social media use to poor mental health are overblown. Of course, there may be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974832/facebook-google-surveillance-data-assault-privacy-amnesty-international&quot;&gt;plenty&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/11/04/i-worked-political-ads-facebook-they-profit-by-manipulating-us/&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/22/sacha-baron-cohen-facebook-propaganda&quot;&gt;reasons&lt;/a&gt; to go cold turkey on social media — but for now, it’s not clear that our psychological well-being is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15213269.2019.1688171&quot;&gt;Experimentally manipulating social media abstinence: results of a four-week diary study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;If you are left revolted by the sight of someone failing to wash their hands after visiting the bathroom, or by the idea of people engaging in sexual acts that you consider unacceptable, you’re more likely to be politically conservative than liberal, according to previous research. But now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167219880191&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink0&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, challenges the idea that disgust is an especially conservative emotion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Julia Elad-Strenger at Bar-Ilan University, Israel, and her colleagues found that some scenarios in fact make liberals more disgusted than conservatives. “Taken together, our findings suggest that the differences between conservatives and liberals in disgust sensitivity are context-dependent rather than a stable personality difference,” the team writes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38615&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Disgust is thought to have evolved to aid in the detection and avoidance of pathogens before they can enter the body. It entails a feeling of revulsion as well as thoughts of potential contamination of the body. And it’s thought that moral disgust developed from this biologically-focused response: faeces and rotten meat (which could harbour disease-causing bacteria) are disgusting, but so are perceived moral transgressions (incest, for example).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past ten years, studies have found that people who are more readily disgusted by a variety of triggers are more likely to be politically conservative. Researchers have suggested that this is because conservatives are more concerned with “purity”-related moral transgressions than liberals, and so are more sensitive to potential “contaminators” within this realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;To test these ideas, &lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;Elad-Strenger and her colleagues initially studied groups of German students. These groups consisted of roughly equal numbers leftists (most liberal), centrists and rightists (most conservative). The participants completed a general disgust sensitivity questionnaire, which assessed how often and how much they felt disgusted in daily life, and were also presented with various potentially disgust-eliciting scenarios. Some of these were designed to be “liberal” disgust-elicitors (scenarios concerning tax evasion, racism, xenophobia and capitalism, for example) while others were potentially more disgusting to conservatives (those referring to homosexuality, the consumption of illegal drugs and a homeless person begging for money, for instance). The participants were asked to rate how disgusted and angry each of these scenarios made them feel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The team found no relationship between scores on the general disgust scale and political orientation. Neither did the conservatives report more disgust overall than the liberals. However, liberals were more affected by the liberal-disgust scenarios, while conservatives were more disgusted by the conservative-disgust selection (especially those relating to homosexuality). “Taken together, these results challenge the notion that conservatives are generally more disgust-sensitive than liberals,” the researchers note.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;A further study of 190 German students explored scenarios involving body-related disgust (for example, seeing dog faeces or seeing someone not washing their hands after going to the bathroom), and also “pathogen disgust” (standing close to someone with body odour, for example). Overall, there was a positive correlation between conservatism and total disgust scores, but this was small. A closer analysis revealed that it was only the scenarios involving bad personal hygiene that triggered more disgust among conservatives, suggesting conservatives aren’t generally more disgusted than liberals, but perhaps experience more disgust in a few specific cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a further study, the team looked at the responses of 202 American participants. The American liberals and conservatives responded in much the same way to the various individual scenarios as the Germans — with liberals more disgusted than conservatives by xenophobia and capitalism, for example, and conservatives more disgusted by homosexuality, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;This study “provides further evidence that the relation between conservatism and disgust sensitivity can be positive, negative or nonsignificant depending on the nature and content of the disgust sensitivity measure,” the researchers write. Overall, their work suggests that claims that conservatives are more easily disgusted stem from an over-generalisation of findings related to specific triggers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167219880191&quot;&gt;Is Disgust a “Conservative” Emotion?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Today a group of editorial leaders from several  publishers, including PLOS, have co-published an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003014&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Editorial &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;highlighting concerns about the “Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science” rule proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This comes eighteen months after the same group published an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/eaau0116&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Editorial &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;when the rule was first proposed, in April 2018. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Our concern is that the EPA proposal will eliminate from consideration in policy-making evidence from many peer-reviewed studies of prime importance to public health. The new proposed requirements do not reflect the norms or capabilities of the field and overreach even PLOS’ progressive data sharing policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS has always supported open sharing of research data.The 2014 update to the PLOS Data policy introduced a requirement for data sharing at publication and was the first of its kind to be applied by a publisher broadly across many disciplines. Since then, PLOS journals have published more than 124,000 articles with a data availability statement indicating where and how relevant data can be accessed, and many other journals have followed suit by adopting encompassing data policies. We continue to champion data sharing as an essential practice of Open Science that supports reproducibility and re-analysis thereby increasing trust and fostering faster scientific developments. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;But our policy also recognizes that open public sharing of research data is not always possible, especially in studies where participant privacy can be at risk. Where that may be the case, we &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-acceptable-data-sharing-methods&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;consider exceptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and we work with authors, editors and reviewers to find ways to satisfy the need for scientific scrutiny while protecting research participants’ privacy. This sometimes means that the data cannot be made publicly available and our experience shows that finding appropriate solutions can be challenging and costly. Too often, researchers are faced with the limitations of the existing infrastructure available to them for sharing and managing data derived from research on human health. We acknowledge these challenges and will continue to work with stakeholders towards better infrastructure to responsibly share sensitive data. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;While the EPA proposed rule recognizes the value of transparency in research, it is designed to apply beyond publishing research into that of regulatory decision-making. Rule making should be informed by the best available evidence, weighted appropriately on the basis of factors that may affect its level of uncertainty or readiness for generalization. Imposing a stringent standard of full data availability for scientific evidence before it can be considered by the EPA would have the consequence of limiting the pool of relevant, peer-reviewed scientific evidence that informs policy-making, both in its number and its diversity. This would have disastrous consequences for public health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For these reasons, and while we reaffirm our commitment to championing open data sharing, we feel compelled to express our concerns about the EPA proposed rule in this Editorial and we encourage US-based readers to submit their own opinions through relevant legislative channels. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In recent years, the term &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinx&quot;&gt;Latinx&lt;/a&gt; has become popular in academic settings in English to designate a group of people without reference to gender, which is designated by -o and -a endings in some Romance languages. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://medium.com/@ThinkNowTweets/progressive-latino-pollster-trust-me-latinos-do-not-identify-with-latinx-63229adebcea&quot;&gt;While academics and Twitter users have begun to use the term, only 2% of the U.S. population actually identifies with this word.&lt;/a&gt; Latinx has become so widely used that Elizabeth Warren has taken to using it on the campaign trail. This has led to a reflection on its political implications in a recent Ross Douthat piece &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://nyti.ms/2JSDPcK&quot;&gt;in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; The interesting question is why a term that is thought to help unify a large group of people would fail to gain wider traction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Spanish is my mother tongue, I can understand why this term would befuddle Spanish speakers. From a linguistic perspective, it makes no sense to create a genderless word in a gender-marked language. Yes, the -o and -a endings signal the grammatical gender, such as in the terms &lt;em&gt;niño and niña. &lt;/em&gt;But the endings for the adult form are not always straightforward, such as in &lt;em&gt;el&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;hombre&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;la mujer.&lt;/em&gt; In fact, all nouns carry grammatical gender and some of these end in -o/a (i.e. &lt;em&gt;la tierra)&lt;/em&gt; and others do not (i.e. &lt;em&gt;el arbol&lt;/em&gt;). Finally, even within categories that have similar meanings there can be variation. In Spanish, it’s &lt;em&gt;el puma&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;la pantera.&lt;/em&gt; But in Italian, one would say &lt;em&gt;la tigre.&lt;/em&gt; Confused yet? Grammatical gender is confusing, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://lightonspanish.com/the-gender-of-animals-in-spanish/&quot;&gt;especially with regard to animals.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all this confusion, Spanish speakers lose a connection between sex and gender. No one would be insulted if they are considered part of &lt;em&gt;el pueblo Latino&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;la gente Latina.&lt;/em&gt; Just because someone says I am part of &lt;em&gt;la gente Latina&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t make me feel that they are referring only to women. For a speaker of this class of Romance languages, the notion that gender and sex are the same thing makes little sense. Yes, gender originates in sex but it is not the same thing when it comes to non-sexed nouns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem arises when we use a gender-marked Romance language term in English contexts. For example, one day I ran across a cover for &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; that characterizes Selena as “&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onnewsstandsnow.com/collections/newsweek/products/newsweek-selena-the-life-and-legacy-of-tejanos-queen?variant=7841788788789&quot;&gt;Tejano’s Queen&lt;/a&gt;.” I was confused by this. Did they mean &lt;em&gt;Tejano’s&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. people from Texas) music? The word music was never used so I kept on reading. I found that the special issue was “proud to present Selena, a 100-page tribute to the most beloved Tejano singer of all time.” Oh, so she was a Tejano singer and the reference was to music. But, in fact, she would be &lt;em&gt;una cantante de musica &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tejana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;or &lt;em&gt;una cantante &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tejana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Either way, the gender would be feminine not masculine. &lt;em&gt;Tejana&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Tejano&lt;/em&gt; had been masculinized to the latter. This is not unusual for Anglophones. You might remember the once Terminator, and now ex-Governator, Arnold Schwarzenegger stating “No problemo.” The problem (no pun intended) is that it should be &lt;em&gt;No hay problema.&lt;/em&gt; Again, an Anglophone (probably the scriptwriters) “masculinizes” a Spanish noun. Spanish has two genders but for some reason Anglophones think there is only one. Thus, what grammatical gender is and is not becomes entirely lost when moving to a language where gender and sex are the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let’s leave my linguistic perch for a second and think about the implications of the term &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is. The term &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is sought as one that would be all inclusive. The term reminds me of algebra where &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; represents a variable that has no defined meaning. As such it is perfectly suited for equations where a term is unknown. In this case, it can take on any value and in human terms would represent a more inclusive term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with creating a new genderless word, is that it already exists in gender-marked languages that have a true neuter. In Latin, &lt;em&gt;-a&lt;/em&gt; is the plural neuter. In this language, the inclusive term would be Latina, plural without reference to gender. The tricky part is that Latina is also used for feminine singular nouns in many Romance languages, and therefore would not be interpreted as gender neutral. In recent years, some Spanish speakers facing the same dilemma have preferred the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://remezcla.com/culture/latinx-latine-comic/&quot;&gt;ending &lt;em&gt;-e&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to create a more inclusive term. Rather than using a synthetically, anglophonically derived ending such as &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, we could opt for a more organic one that arises from a gender-marked language. In that sense, &lt;em&gt;Latine&lt;/em&gt; is all-inclusive and derives from a language that sought to create a genderless ending system. Spanish is after all a descendant of Latin, the natural language of science and the one used to represent complex concepts in English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you miss the &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, you could tune in for reruns of &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;. Here, you would be presented with the motto “The truth is out there,” which also applies to our search for a genderless all-inclusive term. If modernization is what we seek, we could opt for the new term in Spanish &lt;em&gt;Latine&lt;/em&gt;. Alternatively, we could choose &lt;em&gt;Latina&lt;/em&gt;, the original word from Latin. Which one do you prefer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/a-linguists-perspective-on-the-popularity-of-the-word-latinx/&quot;&gt;earlier version&lt;/a&gt; of this article incorrectly stated that the plural neuter term in Latin is “Latinae.” The author has offered this updated article to address this. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: “Spanish Dictionary” by Abigail Luke.

 &lt;p&gt;The term “open adoption” is unfamiliar to much of the general public, and yet it describes the reality of adoption today. These are adoptions in which there is some contact or exchange of information between birth families and adoptive families, before or after the adoption. With growing awareness of the benefits of openness for children and families, the vast majority of adoption agencies—95%—do not facilitate closed adoptions (the old adoption arrangements, where no identifying information was shared between adoptive and birth families).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, many people have surmised that a clean break between adopted children and their birth families enables both parties to move on. We now know that is not true. Openness benefits kids by providing them with biological continuity and not denying them the truth of their origins and background, thus aiding in identity development. It benefits birth parents as well. Given that birth parents are unlikely to forget the children they place for adoption, openness may help to alleviate their pain and guilt. For adoptive parents, openness can ease fears and questions, reassuring them about the permanency of the adoption, and promote empathy toward the birth parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was research on the benefits of open adoption—and the downsides of closed adoptions—that, over time, moved adoption agencies to gradually shift their practices towards that of facilitating open adoptions. So what does open adoption look like in practice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The realities of open adoption are complex. Some adoptive and birth families exchange basic information through the adoption agency, either before adoption or on an ongoing basis. No information is shared directly between parties. Adoptive parents send photos and updates to the agency, which pass these on to birth families, who can respond in kind—again, through the agency. Other families have direct contact with one another. Contact of any type may range from fairly regular and frequent to infrequent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among families who are initially hesitant about the idea of open adoptions, most ultimately embrace it, as they grow to understand and appreciate the benefits of openness—and to view it as less unfamiliar and scary. Far more common than stories of adoptive parents who wish for less contact are stories of adoptive parents who long for more contact, especially over time, as their children grow older. Indeed, sometimes birth parents drop out of contact (due to mental health, substance abuse, or housing issues, or pain and loss associated with the placement), and this is typically very challenging for adoptive parents, who recognize that the birth parents’ presence (or absence) would likely become more significant for their children over time—not less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one lesbian adoptive mom, Mariette, puts it: “It’s been very disappointing for me because we did an open adoption and we&lt;em&gt; really&lt;/em&gt; wanted there to be more of a connection.” A heterosexual adoptive dad named Matt describes how his 8 year-old son was struggling with a loss of contact with his birth mother: “That realization of, ‘Why doesn’t she want to have contact with me?’ We’re getting those questions now. We tell him, ‘We wish we had contact with her too.’ Recently we’ve been involving him in the letters that we send to her. We ask, ‘Is there anything you want to add?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family relationships are complex—and those between adoptive families and birth families are no exception. Sometimes adoptive parents express sadness or even frustration with birth parents—such as surrounding their ongoing mental health or substance abuse struggles, which are often among the issues that had led them to make an adoption plan in the first place. Yet alongside feelings of sadness, disappointment, or frustration, these adoptive parents are often also deeply committed to and appreciative of their children’s birth parents, recognizing all that they are up against and continuing to value them their children’s first, and birth, parents. Deb, a lesbian adoptive mother, has a particularly nuanced set of feelings about her daughter Marlo’s birth parents, explaining that,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact [is] that they have certain issues that might impact their ability for a healthy relationship with Marlo [child]. That’s part of why they chose us to raise her. I think there will be some sad lessons ahead, but I think one thing that makes it easier is their decision to place her with us was a decision made out of love. They loved her.  . .and they made one of the toughest decisions of their lives. We feel that every time we talk with them in person or on the phone; you can feel that pain still. It’s awful to witness and it must be horrible to feel, but that pain comes from the fact that they do love her. If we can help her know that they love her, that she wasn’t abandoned, that would be one of the greatest gifts I think we could give her”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deb’s quote illustrates what so many stories reveal: the power of acknowledging, in all its complexity, the pain and the beauty in adoption. Open adoption, in its best sense, means acknowledging and embracing complexity, rather than wishing it or willing it away. It means a both/and perspective, not an either/or perspective. It means staying present to loss—and inviting in connection. It means doing family in a way that is authentic and real, and not the stuff of storybooks. All families are complex. Families in open adoptions are perhaps especially complex—and, in an ideal world, deeply aware of and in conversation with that complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Ben Kerckx from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/heart-love-romance-valentine-700141/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixabay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/connecting-families-through-open-adoption/&quot;&gt;Connecting families through open adoption&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/610230020/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/610230020/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/610230020/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/610230020/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/610230020/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/610230020/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/610230020/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/610230020/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/610230020/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/610230020/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/the-truth-about-latinx/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The truth about ‘Latinx’ [a revision]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/a-linguists-perspective-on-the-popularity-of-the-word-latinx/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The truth about ‘Latinx’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/fake-news-gone-viral-how-misunderstanding-scientific-uncertainty-leads-epidemics/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fake news gone viral: How misunderstanding scientific uncertainty leads to epidemics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Having a bit of a fuzzy memory is not an uncommon side effect of having had too much to drink the night before — and the details we do remember are often somewhat limited. The same can also be true for our attention when drunk: we’re only able to concentrate on what’s going on in front of us and not what’s happening elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon has been termed “alcohol myopia”: attentional shortsightedness related to alcohol consumption. A new &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269881119882856&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt; suggests this shortsightedness may apply to human faces, too — and that it could have an impact on how well people can identify perpetrators of crimes they witness while drunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38599&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the idea, Alistair Harvey and Danny Tomlinson recruited 76 students from a particularly apposite place — a university bar. Participants, all of whom had normal or corrected to normal vision, were first shown twenty-one photographs of young white adult male faces. Then five minutes later, they saw a selection of these “old” faces again, amongst a number of previously unseen “new” faces of the same demographic and description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some faces were shown in full, while others showed only “external” features such as hair and face shape, or direct “internal” facial features like the eyes and mouth. Participants were asked to identify which photographs showed old faces and which showed new ones, and indicate how confident they were in their identifications on a scale of one to nine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; data-shortcode=&quot;caption&quot; id=&quot;attachment_38604&quot; style=&quot;width: 445px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;faces&quot; class=&quot; size-full wp-image-38604 aligncenter&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;38604&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;faces&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/faces.png?w=445&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/faces.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/faces.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;445,187&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/26/drinking-alcohol-focuses-our-attention-on-the-external-features-of-faces-with-implications-for-eyewitness-memory/faces/&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/faces.png?w=845&quot; /&gt;Examples of full, external and internal faces shown to participants, &lt;em&gt;via &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269881119882856&quot;&gt;Harvey and Tomlinson (2019)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, full face recognition was not any worse in those who had been drinking alcohol compared to sober participants. But drinkers were more likely to recognise external faces than their internal facial features, and those with greater breath alcohol levels performed worse when it came to these internal faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfamiliar faces are normally encoded “holistically” — individual features and their relationship to each other are all integrated into a whole memory. But the team suggests that alcohol disrupts this process, thus making memory more feature-based than holistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the finding could have implications for how intoxicated witnesses later identify criminal suspects: the encoding bias towards external features could make witnesses less likely to identify a perpetrator who has changed or disguised their hair, for example — or more likely to falsely identify an innocent line-up filler with similar external features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How gender impacts this phenomenon is yet to be established: all photos were of men, but women tend to have more diverse hairstyles, so there may be differences in memory of male and female faces, as previous studies with sober participants have suggested. Would more diverse styles and colours of hair make external features more distinctive and therefore easier to remember, for instance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is obviously limited by its design: unrecorded drug consumption may also have impacted participants’ ability to remember faces, and their history and their relationship with alcohol wasn’t examined. How much and how frequently someone drinks could be an additional influence on memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the research does suggest that facial recognition is affected in subtle and often counter-intuitive ways by the consumption of alcohol. When it comes to remembering exactly who you met the night before, this might not seem like too big a deal. But when witnessing a crime, our ability to recall what we saw may not be so insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269881119882856&quot;&gt;Alcohol myopia and the distracting effects of hair in face recognition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Nematode-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helminth parasites, or parasitic worms, cause severe disease in grazing ruminants. Anthelmintic drugs are frequently used to control these infections, but this has resulted in the emergence of anthelmintic-resistant (AR) helminth populations. AR has been detected in all major helminth species across Europe and globally and threatens effective control of parasitic infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.combar-ca.eu/&quot;&gt;COST Action COMBAR – Combatting Anthelmintic Resistance in Ruminants&lt;/a&gt; – is a European based working group that aims to advance research on the prevention of anthelmintic resistance (AR) in helminth parasites of ruminants in Europe and disseminate current knowledge amongst stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11467&quot; style=&quot;width: 409px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-11467&quot; height=&quot;210&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/COMBAR-2019-300x158.jpg&quot; width=&quot;399&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Group photo of third COMBAR Joint Working Group meeting, Ghent, Belgium (27-29 August 2019)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third joint Working Group and Management Committee meeting of COMBAR was held between 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-29&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; August 2019 at Het Pand situated in the historical center of Ghent, Belgium. 125 participants from 31 countries and 5 continents attended the three-day meeting. Key opinion leaders and specialists discussed their research and innovations for sustainable helminth control with the central theme being “Anthelmintic resistance in ruminants: Who cares?”. This topic was addressed through four main themes with keynote and oral presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theme 1: Diagnosing the impact of anthelmintic resistance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Domino, Hand, Stop, Corruption&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;260&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/03/09/11/49/domino-665547_960_720.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is globally one of the most important societal challenges and economics plays an important role in combatting antimicrobial resistance”, said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.luke.fi/en/henkilosto/jarkko-niemi/&quot;&gt;Jarkko Niemi&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Natural Resources Institute Finland&lt;/em&gt;. Although AR may be considered part of the bigger AMR problem, it should not be confused with antibiotic resistance as the involved pathogens, drugs, impacts, and mechanisms are different. The financial impacts of AR to farming can nevertheless be substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theme 2: Sustainable parasite control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everybody has a role to play in sustainable parasite control&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everybody has a role to play in sustainable parasite control”, said Gustavo Sabatini of &lt;em&gt;Boehringer-Ingelheim Animal Health&lt;/em&gt;. The pharmaceutical industry has an important role in directing investments towards the development of efficacious parasite control solutions that are both safe to the environment and food consumer. If every stakeholder plays its role accordingly, it will be possible to extend the lifetime of current antiparasitics with negligible harm to the environment and, at the same time, to develop the solutions for sustainable and effective parasite control programs in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theme 3: Enhancing transatlantic collaboration on helminth research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Microscope, Research, Scientific, Lab&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;271&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/02/27/00/32/microscope-3184432_960_720.jpg&quot; width=&quot;405&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Consideration of the many factors that affect the outcome and interpretation of the current field test for AR &lt;em&gt;[the fecal egg count reduction test]&lt;/em&gt; has made it obvious that a simple protocol leads to significant variation between test outcome”, said &lt;a href=&quot;https://vet.uga.edu/person/ray_m-_kaplan/&quot;&gt;Ray Kaplan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;University of Georgia&lt;/em&gt;, USA. Ray leads a group of specialists developing new guidelines for field diagnosis of AR. He proposed that separate procedures should be followed for field and research use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theme 4: Preserving drug efficacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Ireland, Sheep, Lambs, Livestock, Animals, Closeup&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;299&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/01/16/19/54/ireland-1985088_960_720.jpg&quot; width=&quot;399&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deborah Maxwell of &lt;em&gt;ParaBoss &lt;/em&gt;said that “In Australia, they have eight regional programs based on a cohesive set of anthelmintic resistance management principles that are adapted to regional conditions”. Adapting grazing management results in immediate reductions in the need to use anthelmintics, while genetic breeding for sheep resistance has not given clear results so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A session was also devoted to young scientists to report on their short-term scientific missions (STSM). Six young scientists had the opportunity to present the outcome of their STSM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This experience was important for my personal and scientific growth because it was a great opportunity to learn and improve techniques for the diagnosis of worm infections in cattle.”  – Alessandra Amadesi, University of Naples Federico II, Italy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Knowledge and skills acquired during this STSM enabled me to introduce new anthelmintic resistance diagnostic methods to our laboratory” – Marcin Mickiewicz, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, Poland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What progress has COMBAR achieved so far? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the mid-point of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cost.eu/&quot;&gt;European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)&lt;/a&gt; action, COMBAR has made considerable progress in fulfilling its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.combar-ca.eu/about#objectives&quot;&gt;aims&lt;/a&gt;. To date, 32 countries are part of the action with 180 working group members, with nearly 40% of participants being early-career researchers. Fourteen STSMs have been completed so far involving 12 countries. Two successful training schools have been held on advances in diagnosis of helminth infections and AR, and the socio-economic aspects of helminth infections and AR. To date, COMBAR continues to disseminate information to the veterinary community and has published five scientific articles, including two key-opinion papers “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/trends/parasitology/fulltext/S1471-4922(18)30237-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS147149221830237X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&quot;&gt;100 Questions in Livestock Helminthology Research&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/parasitology/article/control-of-helminth-ruminant-infections-by-2030/5E2B8A7B2CFF4E9A7AEA35E33FC7AD9A&quot;&gt;Control of helminth ruminant infections by 2030&lt;/a&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Ankur Sinha's journal club where he discusses his results from his Ph.D. research documented in the preprint: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/810846v1&quot;&gt;Growth rules for the repair of asynchronous irregular neuronal networks after peripheral lesions (Sinha et al. 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. The abstract is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several homeostatic mechanisms enable the brain to maintain desired levels of neuronal activity. One of these, homeostatic structural plasticity, has been reported to restore activity in networks disrupted by peripheral lesions by altering their neuronal connectivity. While multiple lesion experiments have studied the changes in neurite morphology that underlie modifications of synapses in these networks, the underlying mechanisms that drive these changes are yet to be explained. Evidence suggests that neuronal activity modulates neurite morphology and may stimulate neurites to selective sprout or retract to restore network activity levels. We developed a new spiking network model, simulations of which accurately reproduce network rewiring after peripheral lesions as reported in experiments, to study these activity dependent growth regimes of neurites. To ensure that our simulations closely resemble the behaviour of networks in the brain, we deafferent a biologically realistic network model that exhibits low frequency Asynchronous Irregular (AI) activity as observed in cerebral cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our simulation results indicate that the re-establishment of activity in neurons both within and outside the deprived region, the Lesion Projection Zone (LPZ), requires opposite activity dependent growth rules for excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic elements. Analysis of these growth regimes indicates that they also contribute to the maintenance of activity levels in individual neurons. Furthermore, in our model, the directional formation of synapses that is observed in experiments requires that pre-synaptic excitatory and inhibitory elements also follow opposite growth rules. Lastly, we observe that our proposed model of homeostatic structural plasticity and the inhibitory synaptic plasticity mechanism that also balances our AI network are both necessary for successful rewiring of the network.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Geriatrics-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced vascular access planning and use of an AVF versus a tunneled catheter has previously been associated with better outcomes and less mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large proportion of time in late chronic kidney disease (CKD) care is devoted to dialysis preparation and, for those pursuing hemodialysis, establishment of a vascular access.  Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are considered the gold standard given their longevity and lower risk of infection.  Guidelines from &lt;a href=&quot;https://kdigo.org/&quot;&gt;Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)&lt;/a&gt; and international nephrology societies advocate for advanced planning for dialysis vascular access, including the consideration of preserving arm veins, vein mapping prior to surgery, and early referral for vascular surgery. Advanced vascular access planning and use of an AVF versus a tunneled catheter &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.2004090748&quot;&gt;has previously been associated&lt;/a&gt; with better outcomes and less mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11460 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Consultation-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nephrology providers, the creation of an AVF access has become a checkbox exercise in the pre-dialysis management of patients with advance CKD, and the consideration of the impact this vascular access has on patient’s kidney function can be lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-019-1607-4&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; by Benard &lt;em&gt;et al., &lt;/em&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt; looked at the impact of AVF creation on the rate of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline in pre-dialysis patients.  Within this retrospective cohort of 146 patients, crude annual estimated GFR (eGFR) decline rates were -3.6ml+/-4ml/min/1.73m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; pre-AVF and -2.28+/- 3.56ml/min/1.73m&lt;sup&gt;2 &lt;/sup&gt;post-AVF creation, suggesting that the AVF creation may have a reno-protective effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparative findings have previously been reported in the literature. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfv082&quot;&gt;retrospective study&lt;/a&gt;, 123 CKD patients undergoing AVF creation experienced a drop in the GFR decline rate from 5.9 to 0.5ml/min/year when looking at the 2 years prior and after AVF creation. Similarly, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfw220&quot;&gt;cohort&lt;/a&gt; of 3026 CKD veterans, the rate of GFR decline decreased from -5.6ml/min/year to -4.1ml/min/year.  This highlights a need for future work into understanding the possible underlying mechanisms contributing to the reduction of GFR decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that the AVF functions as a low resistance circuit that provides afterload reduction and increased cardiac output. But is it possible that these hemodynamic changes help with blood pressure reduction and increased renal perfusion, slowing the rate of patient’s GFR decline?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11459 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Arteriovenous-Fistula-300x225.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possible benefits of AVF creation on kidney function may promote their use for slowing progression of CKD in addition to the recommended guidelines for managing pre-dialysis patients. Furthermore, if future studies demonstrate AVFs slowing GFR decline, there may be a greater acceptance by patients to move forward earlier with dialysis planning, to preserve their kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While more prospective studies in this area are needed to determine the mechanisms and impact of AVF on kidney function, these recent findings from Benard &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;highlight a need for Nephrologists to consider the impact of AVF creation beyond their primary role as a hemodialysis vascular access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though fidget spinners have been around since the early 1990s, it was 2017 when they really started to make a stir, becoming a seemingly overnight sensation and starting to appear in offices, classrooms, public transport and pretty much anywhere else they were permitted. The actual provenance of the design has been debated, but many companies market the toys as a tool for concentration, particularly for those who have anxiety, ADHD or autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calming — and fun — they may be, but do they actually work when it comes to keeping attention? Julia S. Soares &amp;amp; Benjamin C. Storm from the University of California, Santa Cruz think not. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/acp.3610&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, they look at the marketing of fidget spinners as attentional aides — and come to the conclusion that they may be actively distracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38584&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine the effect of fidget spinners on attention, the team asked 98 undergraduates to watch an educational video lecture about the process of baking bread while either using a fidget spinner or not; a further half of those not using a fidget spinner watched the lecture near someone who was. They were then asked to report any lapses in attention, and took a memory test for the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the logic of the marketing held, those playing with fidget spinners should have outperformed those who were not. But in fact they did not report any fewer lapses of attention than participants from the non-spinning condition, and actually performed significantly worse in the memory test (those who were only &lt;em&gt;near&lt;/em&gt; others using them didn’t show a drop in performance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But could this result have been because participants weren’t used to using the toys? In the second experiment, the team recruited participants who had neutral or positive views of fidget-spinners, removing any potential participants who had negative opinions in a pre-study screening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 48 participants then replicated the first experiment, this time while watching ten minute videos about Hawaiian ruler Kamehameha the Great and Australian bushranger Ned Kelly. Afterwards, they completed a fifteen-item memory test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results seemed to suggest that positive attitudes towards fidget spinners had no impact on how distracting they were: again, those in the spinner condition performed worse on the memory test overall than those in the no spinner condition, and reported more lapses of attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team says their findings add to a growing literature on the potentially negative impact of fidget-spinners on attention. Other studies have shown increased attentional impairment due to fidget spinner use — in some cases, this was even true for those with ADHD, a group that the toy is allegedly meant to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of those involved in the study were using fidget spinners for the first time; results may be different for those who no longer attach any novelty value to the objects and who may be less likely to become distracted by their use. But parts of the second experiment, which specifically focused on those with a positive attitude towards the toys, do seem to suggest that this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Soares and Storm stress in the paper’s conclusion, such findings don’t mean fidget spinners have no worth, nor that they should be completely banned from the classroom. But perhaps ironically for an object often used so mindlessly, it may be worth thinking more carefully about what impact they’re having.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acp.3610?af=R&quot;&gt;Putting a negative spin on it: Using a fidget spinner can impair memory for a video lecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers might be surprised to learn that, despite their diminutive size, spiders have been the focus of intensive study on such variation in animal personality.  Some spider species exhibit a suite of coordinated behavioral traits that vary among individuals but are remarkably consistent within a given individual over time. These behaviors generally fall along a continuum between ‘boldness’ and ‘shyness’. Bold individuals recover quickly from feigned attacks and have a short latency to attack a newly entangled prey item, while shy individuals tend to play dead for longer and take more time before attacking prey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, these personality traits have been investigated in a variety of ecological and social contexts in spiders of the genus &lt;em&gt;Anelosimus&lt;/em&gt;. Although previous multi-generational studies provided evidence that some personality traits are likely to be passed from parents to offspring, we lacked an understanding of the genetic basis of these complex behavioral traits. Even beyond spiders, studies of the genetics of behavioral traits lag behind those investigating physical traits, such as coloration. There are several reasons for this. First, measuring behaviors is challenging since it must be done with living organisms. Second, researchers expect that behaviors will be shaped by both genes and the previous experience of each individual, so there is unlikely to be a perfect association between genetic variation and behavioral traits. Finally, given the complexity of many behavioral traits, we expect them to be influenced by multiple genes, and our ability to detect such a pattern is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spiders exhibit behaviors that are consistent in each individual over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, identifying genetic markers associated with a trait of interest is important because it allows us to investigate the origin and underlying causes of a behavior. Genetic markers also become a valuable tool for future studies. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-019-6172-5&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new study in &lt;em&gt;BMC Genomics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; seeks to bridge this knowledge gap by identifying genetic markers associated with personality traits in the spider &lt;em&gt;Anelosimus studiosus. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, advances in genomics facilitate genetic association studies in organisms that have not been the focus of previous genetic research. To use these emerging tools, Jonathan Pruitt and I sampled spiders along rivers and lakes in eastern Tennessee. We used standard behavioral assays, called ‘startle tests’, to determine the recovery time of each individual after a disturbance (in this instance, puffs of air applied to the spider’s body). Individuals that moved very quickly after this treatment were considered to be bold, while those that played dead for several minutes were considered to be shy. Since this species dwells either in multi-female social groups or in solitary nests in this environment, we also noted the social structure of each source colony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Anelosimus group&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11454 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Anelosimus-group-300x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Pruitt and his colleagues previously demonstrated that social groups are comprised of both bold and shy individuals, so these two variables (sociality and boldness) were considered separately. After we scored these behavioral traits, we used double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing (or ddRADseq) to sequence approximately 0.1% of the genome of each of more than 200 spiders. In parallel, we sequenced and assembled the whole genome of one individual. Although the genome assembly remains highly fragmented due to challenging characteristics of spider genomes, including large size and high content of repetitive DNA sequences, this genome helped us to determine the relative positions of our ddRADseq markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we identified a cluster of seven genetic markers that were associated with boldness in spiders. At each marker, individuals carrying two copies of one sequence (= homozygotes) tend to be bolder, while those homozygous for the other sequence tend to be shier. Heterozygous individuals (in other words, those with one copy of each sequence) tend to exhibit an intermediate recovery time. These markers are associated with one another, and this region of the genome explains 11% of variation in boldness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic markers link to each other to shape the individual ‘personality’ of each animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicates that this genomic region has a pronounced effect on personality, but also suggests that this is not the only portion of the genome that influences personality. We do not yet know whether these markers are within a gene, or whether this genomic region instead influences gene regulation. We did not find any marker associated with the social structure of each individual. For both social structure and personality, our genome scan likely missed interesting variation, since we only surveyed a portion of each individual’s genome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the discovery of a genetic basis for personality traits in spiders opens up a variety of new research directions. Characterizing the genes near the newly identified genomic region and investigating their function will start to reveal how they shape behavior. At the level of the organism, we can measure how each genetic variant influences the success of individuals and groups. At the population level, we can investigate the mechanisms that maintain this genetic variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this study takes an exciting first step toward merging contemporary animal behavior and genetics research in this widespread and fascinating species. More broadly, this discovery helps open the door to understanding animal personality in a broader group of organisms, since the phenomenon is so pervasive in animals.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of excitement at the intersection of neuroscience and AI right now. I had a chance to go to the MAIN2019 conference (Montreal AI and neuroscience), and saw an amazing line-up of people and interesting talks it was. This is a tour of the main ideas that caught my attention at the conference. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7169&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7169&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;EJl1R4LW4AEN3Bk&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/ejl1r4lw4aen3bk.jpeg?w=748&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/ejl1r4lw4aen3bk.jpeg?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/ejl1r4lw4aen3bk.jpeg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;2048,1200&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2019/11/22/ai-and-neuroscience-main2019/ejl1r4lw4aen3bk/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/ejl1r4lw4aen3bk.jpeg?w=748&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MAIN_Community/status/1196116134585606151/photo/1&quot;&gt;From MAIN community twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;From natural to artificial intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Humans are intelligent, and by emulating humans, whether at the level of circuits, algorithms, affordances or objectives, we could create intelligent machines. There’s a cogent explanation of how that’s worked in the past and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30509-3&quot;&gt;how that might work in the future in this editorial from Deepmind&lt;/a&gt;. There’s two concrete examples that people often point to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Convolutional neural nets, which are inspired by the visual system, ultimately from the work of Hubel and Wiesel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reinforcement learning, loosely inspired by the behaviour of the basal ganglia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, there’s a long tail of smaller ideas; for instance, the idea of using &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450&quot;&gt;different types of normalization&lt;/a&gt; to facilitate gradient based learning (whether the role is the same in the brain and in machines is another question, but that’s a story for another day). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Constraining deep neural nets with brain data&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a lot easier to name instances where neuroscience has inspired AI almost by accident than to make a coherent research program based off of that idea. But some people are trying.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One idea is to use brain data (neurophysiological recordings or fMRI) to constrain deep neural nets to a good subspace with high performance. Leila Wehbe from CMU presented some ideas along these lines, fitting a language model pooling both fMRI and text doccuments. She mentioned that right now, joint training predicts the fMRI data well but the results are equivocal on language tasks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It might just be a question of the vastly larger amount of text data than brain data. Pierre Bellec aims to collect hundreds of hours of brain data (MEG and fMRI) from a dozen subjects as part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cneuromod?lang=en&quot;&gt;the Courtois Neuromod project&lt;/a&gt;. These large scale projects could generate the vast amounts of data necessary to train ANNs with brain data exclusively. Very recently there was a proof of concept that showed more robust classification &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05072&quot;&gt;using brain data from mouse visual cortex as a prior on image classification&lt;/a&gt;. These are very early days but I think this approach will work eventually. The only question is whether it will ever be economical to use this method (i.e. 500$ an hour to run an MRI scanner versus pennies per classification on mturk). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Genes as an information bottleneck&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another very popular idea that has been put forward by many groups is that there are two scales of learning in human brains:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a human lifetime scale, i.e. a lot of unsupervised learning, a sprinkle of reinforcement learning, and the tiniest sliver of supervised learning that happens over a single person’s lifetime. This timescale might involve changing billions of &lt;em&gt;weights&lt;/em&gt; (synapses) in the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the evolutionary timescale, i.e. the massive information bottleneck that comes from the tens of thousands of genes we have to encode a nervous system composed of billions of neurons. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s an underlying sub0idea that many individual neurons don’t matter all that much in this context. This is a point that’s been made by many recently, most notably &lt;a href=&quot;http://See also this recent paper for a collection of related ideas.&quot;&gt;in an editorial in Nature Neuroscience by a huge group with Konrad Kording as the senior author&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tony Zador had a talk provocatively titled “a critique of pure learning” that made the point (see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/582643v1&quot;&gt;his paper&lt;/a&gt;) that humans and animals don’t really learn all that much. Instead, they have a number of built-in behaviours that get refined after birth; most of the intelligence is innate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evolution follows fundamentally different dynamics than the common gradient-based learning algorithms that are commonly used in deep learning. Instead of an objective that is optimized by nudging the current estimate of weights, an ensemble of learners carry forward traits that can mutate or be exchanged. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One interesting consequence is that different kinds of emergent collective behaviours with high fitness can emerge: cooperative, individualistic, etc. Evolution moves the whole population towards one of many deep local optima. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2969154&quot;&gt;These are not the benign saddlepoint extrema&lt;/a&gt; or relabeling equivalences of deep learning that can be dealt with stochastic gradient descent. You need new mathematical machinery to understand these ensembles, namely complexity theory (aka complex systems). It’s a really fascinating area of mathematical physics (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RCF2WSV/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1&quot;&gt;here’s a book on the subject&lt;/a&gt;) that is ripe to be explored more in the context of neuroscience. Blaise Aguera y Arcas showed some very early work on this problem and I think it will prove ebullient in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Artificial to natural intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was also a number of talks on improving neuroscience research with the tools of AI. Many of the student posters followed the basic template:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used machine learning method X to solve neuroscience subtask Y and got results Z&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think this is a good first step. The bigger impacts come when we create generic machine learning systems that can used for a lot of different problems. For instance, Mackenzie Mathis spoke about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut&quot;&gt;DeepLabCut, which can segment animal videos to quantify behaviour&lt;/a&gt; in the lab and which has already had a huge impact. We also saw Gael Varoqueux, one of the people behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://scikit-learn.org/stable/&quot;&gt;sklearn&lt;/a&gt;. Just think of the number of papers that use the logistic regression implementation in sklearn – that is some high impact! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yannick Roy presented a poster on a Kaggle-like environment quantifying performance for a wide range of EEG datasets and algorithms. The competition should reveal which models achieve state-of-the-art performance; these models can and boxed so people can download a pre-trained models. This will unlock state-of-the-art performance for non-experts, e.g. clinical researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Separability and manifolds&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People are starting to ask whether artificial neural networks and real neural networks work similarly to solve the same kinds of problems. Sue Yeon Chong presented some interesting work continuing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17631409?dopt=Abstract&quot;&gt;the thread that Jim DiCarlo&lt;/a&gt; started several years back, namely that linear separability increases in natural and artificial neural nets as a function of depth, creating a reservoir of linearly separable manifolds [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/644658v1.full&quot;&gt;see this recent related paper&lt;/a&gt;]. She pulled straight from the old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapnik%E2%80%93Chervonenkis_theory&quot;&gt;VC theory&lt;/a&gt; on complexity and capacity to define the capacity of a neural population in terms of convex hulls and pairwise linear separability. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There were also some strong claims about the importance of neural manifolds in understanding neural responses. Someone (I didn’t jot down whom) claimed that neurons are random projections from the neural manifolds. Do single neurons not matter anymore? Sara Solla showed some beautiful neural manifolds in the context of the control of a cursor via motor cortex. There was a linear projection of the neural activity preserved over days despite neurons dropping in and out of recording; furthermore, there was a linear transformation from neural space to manifold space preserving the spatial structure of the task, which is quite cool. My impression, however, is that in the context of the control of a cursor, only 3 variables matter: x, y and t. So we can embed a task that lives in 3 dimensions in a 3 dimensional neural space – what have we learned? I feel like making higher dimensional version of these tasks will be crucial to make strong claims about the importance of neural manifolds. People have started working on this in the context of vision, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/374090v2.full&quot;&gt;manifolds there are much higher dimensional&lt;/a&gt;, which must reflect the statistics of the task itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Causality&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One thing that kept creeping into many talks is the idea of the usefulness of the tools of causality in research. Patricia Conrod presented very interesting and controversial results on computational psychiatry. She made a causal claim that marijuana use in adolescents decreased their grades, using observational data and the tools Judea Pearl’s do-calculus. I have rarely seen an audience so visibly upset! It felt like listening to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22691267&quot;&gt;Rite of Spring in 1913 Paris&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Causality is hugely important in epidemiology research, and people are starting to really hone in on its role in neuroscience at large. Konrad Kording &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0466-5?WT.feed_name=subjects_social-science&quot;&gt;recently wrote an article on the use of causality in neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, focused on the tools of econometrics. Recently, it’s been shown that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/253351v4&quot;&gt;there’s a link between causal estimation and the credit assignment problem&lt;/a&gt;. This suggests that neurons could perform something similar to gradient descent without global, symmetric signals; see &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01689&quot;&gt;this paper from Blake Richards about this line of work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;BCI&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have massive imposter’s syndrome for applying to jobs after seeing this talk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Postdoc friend&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amy Orsborn presented a really impressive body of work on BCI, following from her work at Bijan Pesaran’s and Jose Carmena’s labs. The basic idea is that BCIs allow one to perform manipulations of the brain that separate different learning processes that often conflated. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5660637/&quot;&gt;Take a look at this editorial for more info&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can we all just define consciousness before talking about it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Suzanne Still&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I heard the C-word (consciousness) from Yoshua Bengio. The counterpoint is that we don’t really what consciousness is and in the absence of knowledge we’re having a circular discussion. I think it’s a – very – interesting discussion to have over a glass of wine but my TL;DR is it’s not science yet and it’s unlikely it will be in my lifetime. But it was still cool!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Verdict: really great food for thought here. Creeping up to top three conferences (with Photonics West and CCN). If you’re on the East Coast by all means come next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38574&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The psychedelic drug DMT produces brain activity that looks like a “waking dream”&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/new-brain-wave-study-shows-how-dmt-alters-our-conscious-1839966771&quot;&gt;reports Ryan F. Mandelbaum at &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. After participants received an intravenous injection of the drug, EEG recordings showed a drop in alpha and beta activity — normally seen during wakefulness — and spikes of delta and theta activity, associated with sleep and dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive psychology promises to help people live better, more fulfilling lives — but some say the movement has become &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;almost like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; a religion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Happiness researcher Joseph Smith &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/11/13/20955328/positive-psychology-martin-seligman-happiness-religion-secularism&quot;&gt;explores some of the criticisms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Nature and nurture are traditionally set in opposition to each other. But in truth, the effects of environment and experience often tend to amplify our innate predispositions.” &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/nature-versus-nurture-how-modern-science-is-rewriting-it-127472&quot;&gt;Kevin Mitchell and Uta Frith explain&lt;/a&gt; why we should stop thinking of nature and nurture as “adversaries”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many women feel “phantom” fetal kicks long after they’ve given birth&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2224235-some-women-feel-fetal-kicks-years-after-theyve-given-birth/&quot;&gt;reports Grace Browne at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers in Australia found that 40% of women surveyed had experienced these kicks, which continued for around 7 years on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After childhood surgery to remove one side of the brain, many patients recover surprisingly well — and now scientists have a better idea why&lt;/strong&gt;.  Researchers found that patients who’d had a hemispherectomy — which is performed to treat rare neurological conditions — showed stronger connectivity within brain networks than controls, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/health/brain-removal-hemispherectomies-scans.html&quot;&gt;writes Knvul Sheikh at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The study suggests that these surviving brain regions are compensating for the parts that have been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, if you recoil when you see bubbling batter or an empty wasps’ nest, perhaps you have trypophobia — the fear of clusters of holes and cracks&lt;/strong&gt;. But is it a “proper” phobia? Or is the experience better described as a manifestation of disgust, or even a “social contagion”? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/nov/19/whats-behind-a-phobia-of-holes&quot;&gt;Chrissie Giles has the answers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Thanks to Blake Alec Miranda from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/myassa/&quot;&gt;Yassa Translational Neurobiology Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; at the University of California, Irvine for this article on resistance training and brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I (Blake) live in Los Angeles where it seems like everyone and their grandmother is obsessed with fighting fat and building muscle. It’s a stereotype that we SoCal lifers embrace, but don’t take too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, I didn’t realize how ubiquitous exercising had become until my actual grandmother messaged me over Instagram a few months ago asking about a brand of running shoes. Rather than question how my 75-year-old grandma made an Instagram (and why she still hasn’t followed me back, for that matter), it got me thinking about the effect exercise can have on the lives of our oldest adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking with Dr Sarah McKay, it was almost serendipitous that we got to talking about the Study of Mental and Resistance Training (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2016/10/25/increasing-muscle-strength-can-improve-brain-function--study.html&quot;&gt;SMART&lt;/a&gt;) study that examined resistance training and its relationship to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clinical trial suggest lifting weights protects against dementia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Study of Mental and Resistance Training (SMART) is a clinical trial conducted by Maria Fiatarone Singh and collaborators at the University of New South Wales and the University of Adelaide. Singh recruited 100 adults aged 55-86 from the surrounding community diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with MCI suffer from significant memory impairment but they’re still able to live independently. It is often considered a precursor to dementia as neurodegeneration progresses with advanced age, and many clinical trials are interested in slowing this decline at the MCI stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh and her team assigned their recruits to one of four training groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;computer cognitive training + stretching exercises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;computer cognitive training + resistance training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watched videos/quizzes + resistance training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watched videos/quizzes + stretching exercises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For six months the over-55s come into the lab-gym for closely supervised weight training two or three days a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The over-55s cognitive outcomes were tracked using the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive scale (ADAS-Cog) and multiple measures of working memory. A follow up at 18 months was conducted after study completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After six months, those who lifted weights with sham cognitive training (group 3) showed improvement in their ADAS-Cog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Yorgi Mavros one of the researchers involved says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we found in this follow up study is that the improvement in cognition function was related to their muscle strength gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stronger people became, the greater the benefit for their brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot; title=&quot;Page 7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot; title=&quot;Page 7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;layoutArea&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to expected, group 2 who received full doses of resistance training + cognitive training performed &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; than those lifting weights alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh suggests he combined intervention, which was both mentally and physically challenging, could have resulted in excessive stress, less engagement in-home or community-based activities, or other changes that inhibited rather than promoted neural plasticity and cognitive benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Should everyone with mild cognitive decline lift weights?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, should we all encourage our tech-savvy grandmothers to take up weight training?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It depends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMART makes a strong case for resistance training, but it’s not the end of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular exercise alone has also shown similar promise in protecting against cognitive decline, and the degree to which physical fitness interacts with genetics, sex, and other risk factors for dementia is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step now is to determine if the increases in muscle strength are also related to increases in brain size that we saw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers make a compelling case for introducing resistance training into our lives, and we can all benefit from a healthy lifestyle that balances cardio, weights and diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more we can get people doing resistance training like weight lifting, the more likely we are to have a healthier ageing population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;says Mavros,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key however is to make sure you are doing it frequently, at least twice a week, and at a high intensity so that you are maximising your strength gains. This will give you the maximum benefit for your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of Sarah’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/staying-younger-for-longer-brain/11430770&quot;&gt;ABC Catalyst show&lt;/a&gt; on healthy brain ageing, she met Neils who took part in the SMART trial. Neils joined the trial a few years ago and &lt;em&gt;reversed&lt;/em&gt; his mild cognitive decline by lifting weights!  He hasn’t looked back and still lifts weekly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger &lt;/em&gt;Freddy Parker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did you sleep last night? If the answer is “badly” followed by an uninvited pang of anxiety, look no further for an explanation than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0754-8&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; published this month in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lack of sleep is known to lead to feelings of anxiety, even among healthy people. But the new paper reveals that the amount of “deep” or slow-wave sleep is most pertinent to this relationship. That, the authors conclude, is because slow-wave brain oscillations offer an “ameliorating, anxiolytic benefit” on brain networks associated with emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38556&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this link, Eti Ben Simon and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley, ran a series of experiments. First, the team recruited 18 students to come into the lab: once for a full night of shut eye, and again for a night of no sleep. In the evening and the following morning, participants filled in a questionnaire to measure their anxiety levels. And in the morning they also viewed emotionally-charged, aversive videos while the researchers looked at brain activity using functional MRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to a night of sleep, after the all-nighter scans revealed reduced activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-16700-010?casa_token=Cq4OT_7nj1QAAAAA:vEFCoyTkqVb6tDJgygt25c4ngpTrrDmuNlOy3HSGxfFiON5nJWdd4fVCHg7bKV2UNI1BJFEhwZKzWJLZrLabwfs&quot;&gt;typically responsible for emotional regulation&lt;/a&gt;, whereas deeper emotional centres of the limbic system, such as the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.ne.15.030192.002033?casa_token=gT8VIPTXCPEAAAAA%3AGa9j6WnArUoVMz-VF7k2I-p2usCzF23hCKIgSSlCk6dzkUCVAfem8TsLLDWLGQUttNiCTNnbwxk_5A&quot;&gt; amygdala&lt;/a&gt;, appeared hyperactive. That is akin to the brain pressing “heavy on the emotional accelerator pedal, without enough brake”, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-11/uoc--stt110419.php&quot;&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;senior author Matthew Walker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite remarkably, half of these sleep-deprived students reported anxiety scores that would normally signal a clinical anxiety disorder. In fact, these scores were directly related to changes in brain activity: those with the steepest drop in mPFC activity reported the greatest spike in anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How was sleep protecting against these changes? In the video-watching session where participants slept beforehand, those who &lt;span&gt;had&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;managed more slow-wave sleep had greater activity in the mPFC, and less in the limbic system. It thus appears that deep sleep had restored the brain’s prefrontal capacity to regulate emotions and prevent the escalation of anxiety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t end there. The team also conducted an online study in which 154 people of all ages recorded their sleep and anxiety levels over four days. Respondents’ data showed that the quality of sleep predicted anxiety levels the following day, with even subtle disruptions during sleep elevating feelings of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the high prevalence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rsph.org.uk/uploads/assets/uploaded/a565b58a-67d1-4491-ab9112ca414f7ee4.pdf&quot;&gt;poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4610617/&quot;&gt;anxiety disorders&lt;/a&gt; in much of the Western world, understanding the mechanisms that link the two is important. By implication the authors support strategies to improve sleep quality in anxious and sleep deprived populations, and suggest sleep could be an overlooked “non-pharmacological intervention for anxiety”. It’s certainly an admirable agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the knowledge that a lack of sleep worsens anxiety is hardly soporific. Indeed, having read Walker’s eye-opening book &lt;em&gt;Why We Sleep&lt;/em&gt;, by passing it to my mother I had unknowingly triggered her own worries about sleep. Regrettably, she now finds it more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So could it be that, in some cases, research like this inadvertently exacerbates the problems scientists set out to resolve? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796717301638?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;Reviews suggest&lt;/a&gt; that worrying about sleep can do more harm than a lack of sleep itself — so it’s important to consider how we communicate these sorts of findings. As a start, it might be wise to bear in mind the bigger picture: sometimes poor sleep is inevitable and does not necessarily signal disaster. It’s also worth remembering that there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.1080/07420520601100971?scroll=top&amp;amp;needAccess=true&quot;&gt; individual differences that buffer against the negative effects of sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt;, while others even have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(19)30652-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS089662731930652X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&quot;&gt;genetic propensity to need less sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these arguments shouldn’t let people, or societies, off the hook. Good sleep serves myriad vital functions, not least keeping anxiety at bay. And future research will doubtless continue to highlight the need to teach people about healthy sleep. It just might also be important to figure out how best to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0754-8&quot;&gt;Overanxious and underslept&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Samuel Sutton will talk about the paper &quot;Efficient codes and balanced networks&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen a growing interest in inhibitory interneurons and their circuits. A striking property of cortical inhibition
is how tightly it balances excitation. Inhibitory currents not only match excitatory currents on average, but track them on a
millisecond time scale, whether they are caused by external stimuli or spontaneous fluctuations. We review, together with
experimental evidence, recent theoretical approaches that investigate the advantages of such tight balance for coding and
computation. These studies suggest a possible revision of the dominant view that neurons represent information with firing rates
corrupted by Poisson noise. Instead, tight excitatory/inhibitory balance may be a signature of a highly cooperative code, orders of
magnitude more precise than a Poisson rate code. Moreover, tight balance may provide a template that allows cortical neurons to
construct high-dimensional population codes and learn complex functions of their inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;The climate crisis is a defining challenge of the 21st century. If we keep on the same emissions path, we expect a sea rise of 2 meters, hundreds of millions of climate refugees, a mass extinction of over half of animal species, and decreases agricultural productivity that could leave a billion people starving by 2100. The IPCC report shows 4 paths of carbon reduction that keep warming to 1.5 degrees, each requiring massive changes in personal behaviours, political structure, economy and technology. Every sector of society will need to join the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists are taking notice. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScA7q3Ob5CiKmub1UPKa1bIIB18mz2p-2Eo2ZDvfsW-0V9Z7g/viewform&quot;&gt;The Society for Neuroscience (SFN) recently hosted a satellite event about tackling climate change – more than 80 people participated&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thefreemanlab/status/1182379104110120960&quot;&gt;Jeremy Freeman stepped down from CZI to focus on climate change&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/swaziadam&quot;&gt;Adam Aron&lt;/a&gt; at UCSD &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(19)30202-5#.XW8Fxc-2-Z8.twitter&quot;&gt;published an editorial on why climate change needs attention from cognitive neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt;; and people like &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05433&quot;&gt;Konrad Kording, Demis Hassabis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adammarblestone.org/&quot;&gt;Adam Marblestone&lt;/a&gt; are publishing detailed breakdowns of the climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can a neuroscientist do about climate change? Neuroscience is not an engineering discipline, so it’s easy to feel powerless, but I’m going to try to show here we have a surprising amount of agency: personal agency, the power to convince, and the power to invent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Personal agency&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScA7q3Ob5CiKmub1UPKa1bIIB18mz2p-2Eo2ZDvfsW-0V9Z7g/viewform&quot;&gt;The SFN event ended in a petition to decarbonize the conference&lt;/a&gt;. This includes suggestions such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hosting satellite events closer to home to limit the amount of travel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;skipping the conference every other year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;integrating teleconferencing to attend remotely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As academics, much of our carbon footprint stems from flight. Assuming that the 30,000 attendees travel on average 10,000 kilometers to get to the conference, it’s roughly 70,000 tons of carbon in the atmosphere from air travel only – or the average annual CO2 emitted by 10,000 EU citizens. In research universities, air travel accounts for a large proportion of the carbon footprint of the institutions; for example, it’s estimated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab33e6/meta&quot;&gt;over 50% of the carbon footprint of Université de Montréal is from air travel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://hiltner.english.ucsb.edu/index.php/ncnc-guide/&quot;&gt;There are already excellent models for zero-carbon conferences&lt;/a&gt;. Traditional international conferences don’t make sense in a carbon-constrained world, and we can refuse to participate in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flying is one of most carbon-intensive behaviours scientists participate in, and one of the highest leverage items. Neuroscientists also consume resources to run their labs, and these resources – and the embodied carbon – are wasted when the products of the research are not shared. This is a strong argument for open science. A salient example of resource use is training state-of-the-art deep learning models, trading GPU cycles for classification accuracy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243&quot;&gt;One recent analysis estimated a carbon footprint of half a ton of CO2 for training a single NLP model (BERT); an architecture search over different networks yielded numbers in the hundreds of thousands of tons&lt;/a&gt;. Computational neuroscientists should share their trained models to prevent the wasted resources from re-training. Experimentalists should also share their data for the same reason. Data carries an embodied carbon footprint from the materials used to collect it (plastics, animal facilities, the carbon used to ship materials across borders, etc.), and publishing the existing data makes more use of the same amount of resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I’ve focused on activities specific to scientists, we can participate in the same carbon-cutting behaviours recommended for everyone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having fewer children&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;living car-less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eating a plant-based diet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using green energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;living in more modest houses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; data-shortcode=&quot;caption&quot; id=&quot;attachment_7152&quot; style=&quot;width: 758px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7152 size-large&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7152&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;The most effective individual actions&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/themosteffec.jpg?w=748&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/themosteffec.jpg?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/themosteffec.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1500,872&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2019/11/20/what-can-a-neuroscientist-do-about-climate-change/themosteffec/&quot; height=&quot;435&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/themosteffec.jpg?w=748&quot; width=&quot;748&quot; /&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/news/2017-07-effective-individual-tackle-climate-discussed.html&quot;&gt;Wynes and Nicolas (2017)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The power to convince&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 70% of people in the US believe that climate change is happening; that leaves 30% of people that remain to be convinced. Furthermore, only a small fraction of believers act. Neuroscientists, as teachers and science communicators, can help people graduate from disbelief to disengagement to action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have a lot of influence. They are consistently ranked among the most trusted professions in the US, and they can bring attention to important matters via teaching, their online presence and their political influence. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(19)30202-5#.XW8Fxc-2-Z8.twitter&quot;&gt;As Adam Aron points out in his editorial&lt;/a&gt;, people are more convinced about the urgency of the climate crisis when communicators adopt themselves a low-carbon lifestyle. So scientists’ power to convince is gated by their own adoption of the behaviours they want to see in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As academics, we have a higher standard of what it means to understand something, so before we go convincing, we have the duty to become well-informed. I think we can all take time to better understand the mechanisms of climate, the evidence for it, and its consequences. Plenty of resources are available to learn these materials; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edx.org/course/climate-change-the-science-and-global-impact&quot;&gt;a very good starting point is Michael Mann’s class on edX&lt;/a&gt;. Those more inclined to learn about the solution space should read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.withouthotair.com/&quot;&gt;late David Mackay’s book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that we’ve changed our own behaviours and learned how climate change works, we need to find ways to amplify our own actions and convince others to act. This forum can be the classroom; &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/t8s4k/&quot;&gt;Adam Aron’s class on climate change psychology&lt;/a&gt; gives us a template. This also has to include political activism; we can vote for parties that support carbon taxes and decarbonization; join grassroots advocacy groups; and support and participate in civil disobedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the research level, Adam Aron argues that cognitive neuroscientists can help the climate crisis by studying the mechanisms by which people acquire beliefs about climate change, how they propagate through their social networks, what kinds of messages they best respond to, and what motivates them to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mila.quebec/en/ai-society/visualizing-climate-change/&quot;&gt;For example, a group at MILA is working on generating flooded images&lt;/a&gt; of people’s homes so they can experience for themselves what it will be like to live in with a 6 foot sea level rise. The hypothesis is that people are emotional decision makers and will respond best to emotionally-loaded messages. These kinds of approaches are ripe to be studied from both a neuroscientific decision-making perspective and an econometric efficacy perspective. What causes people to graduate for disbelievers to believers? What causes people to move from belief to action? And how many tons of CO2 could we keep in the ground if we convinced 1,000 people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The power to invent&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many readers of this blog are technologists, engineers and programmers in addition to neuroscientists. Technological innovation will be crucial to limit climate change to 1.5 degrees. Software allows us to communicate climate change, to visualize it, predict it, plan for it, and mitigate it. Physical engineering will allow us to build the large-scale structures required to keep carbon in the ground. &lt;a href=&quot;http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/&quot;&gt;Bret Victor wrote an excellent blog post&lt;/a&gt; on how technologists can help climate change, and it is a very encouraging read. A  consortium of machine learning researchers, including Yoshua Bengio, Demis Hassabis and Konrad Kording wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.climatechange.ai/&quot;&gt;a sprawling 100-page paper with a companion website&lt;/a&gt; on how artificial intelligence can help climate change. By all means, if you’re a machine learning expert, pick a section in the paper labeled high leverage, and go work on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering is a very small part of neuroscience today, but it will grow in near future. Mainstream (i.e. 10M+ units) consumer-grade BCIs will likely appear on the market in the next 10 years. Meanwhile, decarbonization scenarios that will keep warming to 1.5 degrees will require sustained efforts over the next 80 years. Neuroscience research that might be considered far out has the potential to have massive impact in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning: speculation, thought experiments, future episodes of Black Mirror ahead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are opportunities at the growing convergence of AI and neuroscience. Suppose, for instance, that by studying the brain, we discover an algorithm that opens up a rich area of AI (e.g. reinforcement learning, multi-agent learning, few-shot learning, causal inference, etc.). Some of the applications of this algorithm could be used effectively to mitigate climate change. For instance, suppose one of the downstream applications is counterfactual reasoning in life-cycle analysis; then we could very easily optimize a supply chain to minimize the carbon footprint of a given product. In this case, we’re augmenting human reasoning using AI, itself inspired by human reasoning, with the end goal of tackling climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers are cognitive enhancers – Steve Jobs called them bicycles for the mind. People also use drugs to make themselves smarter, caffeine being the most salient example. People working on climate change may choose – indeed, may feel a moral imperative – to enhance themselves cognitively. The enhancement of well people (whether with nootropics, psychedelics or empathogens) is a taboo subject, but neuroscientists working on these areas  enhance the human potential to solve problems. The same point can be made about invasive BCIs for cognitive enhancement. Supplementing our memory, or having immediate access to a library of all human knowledge, could make us radically smarter, and more effective at fighting climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, humans could eventually choose to radically decrease their carbon footprint by leaving their physical bodies and uploading themselves to the cloud. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading&quot;&gt;While the capacity to emulate a single human brain in real-time using simplified biophysical models is not here yet, it should be feasible within the next 15 years&lt;/a&gt;. The cost of that simulation with today’s efficiency would be around a tenth of the power envelope of the United States. However, efficiency follows a similar trend to Moore’s law, with a doubling in operations per second every 1.5 years or so. At this rate, we could have whole brain emulation at a carbon intensity similar to that of 2019 human by 2055 – at which point uploading becomes carbon efficient, and rapidly more so over time. The carbon-negative technologies introduced in the 2060s might thus include foregoing our physical bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve highlighted three ways in which neuroscientists can help tackle the climate crisis: by changing their personal habits, by convincing others, and by inventing new ways to a carbonless future. We have to soberly evaluate our actions with respect to their causal impact, and live our lives accordingly. Neuroscience, like every sector of society, will have to change to tackle the defining challenge of this century.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;i style=&quot;color: #2c3338; background-color: #ffffff;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;“The sense of self is a hallmark of human experience. Each of us maintains a constellation of personal memories and personality traits that collectively define ‘who we really are'”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;So begins a &lt;span class=&quot;Hyperlink0&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-23055-001&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, which reveals that who you “are” can easily be manipulated. Just imagining somebody else can alter all kinds of aspects of how you see yourself, even including your personality and memories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38542&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meghan Meyer at Dartmouth College and colleagues first asked 185 adults to recall a series of personal memories — a time they received good news or helped a friend in need, for example — and rate how they had felt during that event (on a scale ranging from completely negative to completely positive). Using the same scale, participants were prompted to imagine how others would have felt in reaction to the same events: both an “average American” and also a genuine friend who was similar to them in in personality, temperament, major likes and dislikes, beliefs and values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The participants were then given the original prompts again and asked to rate for a second time their own feelings at the time of the events. The team found these ratings had changed, to become closer to each participant’s assessments of how the others would feel. This effect was particularly strong when the other person was more similar to them — a friend, rather than an “average American”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;For the next study, a fresh group of participants rated themselves on 60 character traits (such as “charming” and “unreliable”), then rated both a friend who was similar to them and also an actual other person — in this case, Walter Cronkite, a former US news anchor — on a subset of 20 of these traits. Next, they rated themselves again. As in the previous study, the participants’ self-ratings changed, becoming closer to those for their friend in particular.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;In a second, remarkable part to this study, a very similar result was found when people were asked to imagine the characteristics of something radically different to themselves: the Empire State Building. The participants first rated themselves on various physical traits, such as being “clean” and “asymmetrical”, and then rated a similar friend and the Empire State Building. Finally, they rated themselves again — and as before, their own ratings had become more similar to those given for the two targets (and especially the friend). The team then went on to find that these “simulation-induced” changes in self-knowledge can still be in place 24 hours on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;How might thinking about other people, or even buildings, reshape your own self-knowledge? The researchers suspect that it happens because when you imagine how someone else looks or would feel and act in a given situation, you’re simultaneously retrieving memories about how you look and how you have felt and behaved in such situations in the past. When your own memories are retrieved, they become vulnerable to modification, which means those imagined reactions can influence your own real ones. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;For example, in thinking about how a friend might respond to being dumped, you may find yourself thinking, “Claire tends to be pretty thick-skinned”. When that knowledge and your relevant self-knowledge (eg. “I was embarrassed when I got dumped last year”) are retrieved simultaneously, considering your friend’s predicted response can tweak your own pre-existing self-knowledge. You might then recollect being less embarrassed about your own experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect might be especially potent when you’re considering someone who is similar (rather than different) to you, because thinking about such a person should trigger more self-related memories, which would then be vulnerable to being altered, the researchers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;So far, the researchers have only checked whether the changes they observed were still in place after a day. It’s not clear yet how long they might last, or whether they would result in any meaningful differences in behaviour. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;But the work does suggest that self-knowledge is just as susceptible to misinformation effects as other types of knowledge, the researchers conclude, adding: “Such findings offer a qualification to the argument that the self is ‘special’.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-23055-001&quot;&gt;Simulating other people changes the self&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 More than five years after comments appeared on PubPeer about a 2012 paper in PLoS ONE with a raft of problematic images — and a deceased member of the group whom the corresponding author suggests might have been able to support the validity of the data — the journal has retracted the article.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gender inequality in the business world has been much discussed over the last few years, with a host of mentoring schemes, grants, business books and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/treasury-launches-review-into-barriers-for-women-in-business&quot;&gt;political activity&lt;/a&gt; all aimed at getting women into leadership positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens when this goal is achieved? According to new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspa0000176.pdf&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, unequal gender dynamics still prevail even at the very top. Nicole Votolato Montgomery and Amanda P. Cowen from the University of Virginia found that women CEOs are judged far more harshly than their male counterparts when a business fails ethically. However, when a failure is down to incompetence, they find, women receive less negative backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38534&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first experiment, 512 participants were given a news article to read about a car manufacturer, and then asked to fill out a survey on whether or not they would buy from the company. A third of participants read about an &lt;em&gt;ethical&lt;/em&gt; failure (the company had known of a vehicle’s defect but done nothing about it), a third read about a &lt;em&gt;competence&lt;/em&gt; failure (the company had not known about the failure) and a third simply read a description of the company. Gender of the company’s CEO was varied: some participants read that the CEO was named Adam, whilst others read they were named Abigail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were then asked how likely they were to buy a vehicle from the company, answered questions on the organisation’s competency, dependability and trust, and rated how severe they felt the failure was on a seven point scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an ethical failure had taken place, participants expressed less intent to buy a car from the company if they had read that the CEO was a woman than if they had read it was a man. But when the company &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; aware of the defect, they were more likely to report intent to buy if a woman was at the helm. There was no difference in intent for participants who read just the company description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second experiment, 416 participants read the same news article as those in the first — but in this piece of writing, female and male CEOs were described with either “communal” traits, stereotypically associated with women — e.g. “helpful”, “sensitive”, and “good at listening” —  or “agentic” traits associated with men — e.g. “independent”, and “works well under pressure”. Participants were then given the same survey questions as in the first experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When participants read about an ethical failure where the CEO’s traits were congruent with stereotypes — women as helpful, men as strong, for example — results from the first experiment held: intent to buy from the female-led company was lower. But this changed when the stereotypes were inconsistent with the CEO’s gender: participants were less likely to buy from an organisation led by a man described as “helpful” and “sensitive” than one led by a “independent” and “strong” woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team suggests that highlighting such traits in female leaders can “reduce the penalties for female-led organisations”. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2015/02/12/women-shouldnt-have-to-lead-like-men-to-be-successful/&quot;&gt;others argue&lt;/a&gt; that women leaders shouldn’t give in to the pressure of adopting typically “male” traits, and that being helpful and community-focused are actually positive things to bring to the board room. Leaning into stereotypes may not be the best way, long-term, to break them — but either way, it’s clear there’s still a way to go for women in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspa0000176.pdf&quot;&gt;How Leader Gender Influences External Audience Response to Organizational Failures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/Comment_preprint-image_blog-bubble3-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was co-written by Dan Morgan, Director of Community Relations; Rebecca Kirk, Associate Editorial Director, Madison Crystal, Brand Communications Manager; and Veronique Kiermer; Publisher and Executive Editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preprints enable authors to share their work early, openly, and in a way that is free from journal influence or stylistic preferences. They also open up possibilities for pre-publication commentary that have previously been limited to a group of trusted confidants and hand-selected (often anonymous) peer reviewers invited by the editors. The opening up of comments via email, Twitter, or on the preprint server has the potential to expand the number of voices involved in the peer review of manuscripts, to allow the development of a preprint in parallel with the formal peer review, and to accelerate the research process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore these opportunities, we recently launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/&quot;&gt;preprint commenting pilot&lt;/a&gt;, which will enable handling editors at PLOS Journals* to better access and utilize comments left on preprinted submissions for consideration in their review of the manuscript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the announcement speaks for itself, we also wanted to give more context for our work in engaging with preprints and facilitating comments more broadly. Driven by our work alongside the research community, these fall into three major strategic directions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. A more equitable platform for community review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS has always sought the most equitable systems of publishing, for all research and researchers. In preprints we have a posting and reviewing infrastructure that is not based on a closed database of reviewers end editorial board members, but open to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one conversation we might hear from editors who say they struggle to find reviewers for papers, and in another conversation we hear from scientists, especially early career researchers, who are looking for an opportunity to review or edit for a journal, but are not being invited. Editorial work is often labeled as a “volunteer” activity, but it is less a system of volunteering and more a system of being known and &lt;em&gt;chosen&lt;/em&gt;, in the current setup. And the best chance of being chosen, of course, lies with those who have been chosen in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By promoting preprints and their commenting infrastructure, PLOS is attempting to even more equitably open up editorial activity to all who have something to offer. And the various tools, vendors, publishers companies (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cshl.edu/transparent-review-in-preprints/&quot;&gt;TRiP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plaudit.pub/&quot;&gt;plaudit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.hypothes.is/&quot;&gt;hypothes.is&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006971333-Peer-Review&quot;&gt;ORCiD&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) are developing the infrastructure to enable it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Published outputs should be shaped by the &lt;em&gt;scholarly process&lt;/em&gt;, and not by publishers’ preferences or requirements. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS has long empowered scientists to publish great science. Our work as a publisher is essential and important, but it is not a proxy to judge the quality of our authors’ articles. Our journals are selective against a spectrum of criteria, but our efforts are always in &lt;em&gt;partnership with the community&lt;/em&gt; whose activities we facilitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some publishers, while they allow submissions that have been preprints, do not engage with them because they view them as a force that is too publisher- or journal-independent — a publishing movement that may one day reduce or even remove the need for journal brands completely. We see an opportunity to learn from our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, preprints represent the purest form of published output. While authors generally still follow standard article conventions, and many preprints have emerged from parallel posting alongside submission to PLOS, this is not a requirement. For PLOS it is extremely interesting to see how authors choose to write up their work when it is being posted on a preprint server, and not being “prepared” for a specific journal or editorial approach. Our hope is that a preprint culture helps empower authors to share their work early, often, and in their preferred way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. More editorial activity is better for all concerned, including researchers but also publishers, and may save everyone time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our pilot for flagging bioRxiv comments to editors is an attempt to see how useful such comments on preprints are for handling editors, how easy it is for us to identify and push them to the attention of editors, and whether this activity speeds up the reviewing process, increases the diversity of voices reviewing, AND encourages more people to comment on preprints. But the manuscript peer review will not solely rely on this new process–it is in parallel with the standard process and editors will consider the comments at their own discretion, based on how useful they determine the comments to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, for publishers, we believe there is always a need for more reviewers and more editors (especially when you operate one of the biggest journals in the world in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;!). We can’t think of a better way to expand the universe of relevant editorial activity than by both enabling a training &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;providing an open ground for new reviewers to demonstrate their expertise. The availability and openness of preprint comments, in conjunction with our new &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/&quot;&gt;published peer review history option&lt;/a&gt;, is finally surfacing the richness of these activities and resources and. And, as such, we look forward to the training and empowering of more diverse voices and to ever more early career reviewers to joining the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are expecting the results of the pilot to be mostly qualitative — the reality being that at the moment only 10% of bioRxiv preprints receive comments — but we will seek opinions from editors and authors about their experience and we will share our learnings broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/tweet.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-8897&quot; height=&quot;226&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/tweet-300x164.png&quot; width=&quot;413&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/siminevazire/status/1143465254980149248&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/siminevazire/status/1143465254980149248&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three strategic directions above focus on how engaging with preprints and comments may improve the publishing and reviewing process itself, and move it closer to a fully equitable, community-driven practice. But it would be remiss to not also mention the importance of the increased potential for credit for all research activity, which we will focus on in a future blog post. In short, and in advance, there are many ways that these preprint initiatives are natural extensions of our passion for surfacing credit for all researchers in their activities, already including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/07/author-credit-plos-and-credit-update/&quot;&gt;CRediT taxonomy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/06/youve-completed-your-review-now-get-credit-with-orcid/&quot;&gt;ORCID for Reviewers&lt;/a&gt;. More in due course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of open, please do leave us comments and questions below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*The commenting trial is available on submissions to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/&quot;&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/&quot;&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ntds/&quot;&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/pathogens/&quot;&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Body image can be a tricky enough thing to navigate in adulthood: for young people, it can be even more difficult. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4554432/&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that adolescence is a “pivotal time” for the development of positive or negative body image — and that poor body image can in turn have a devastating impact on overall self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how someone looks doesn’t just change how they feel about themselves — it can change the way other people treat them, too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.20171&quot;&gt;One 2013&lt;/a&gt; study found that weight was a factor in graduate school admissions, with overweight applicants less likely to receive an offer. And now &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjep.12322?af=R&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Educational Psychology&lt;/em&gt; suggests this bias can start before students are even in their teens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38519&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past research has found that obesity is related to poorer educational achievement, though exactly why has not been established. Kristin Finn and colleagues at Canisius College wondered whether it might come down to discrimination and stigma, pointing to several other studies that suggest this could be the case. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22531092&quot;&gt;2013 paper,&lt;/a&gt; for instance, found that obesity was related to &lt;em&gt;assessment&lt;/em&gt; of academic performance but not to standardised test scores: overweight children were just as smart but not as successful, as that research put it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this hypothesis further, the team recruited 133 teachers from suburban middle and high schools in New York State; the teachers were a variety of ages and &lt;span&gt;taught a range of subjects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Recruited at staff meetings, participants were asked to take part in a study ostensibly looking at the validity of school grading, and were given a short, handwritten essay on health and fitness to evaluate, written by an eleven-year-old student. The essays had been gathered from a separate classroom writing exercise and chosen precisely because they were of average quality — external educators had rated them neither excellent nor poor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were also provided with a picture of a young girl, purportedly the author of the essay — in one condition, a picture of a ‘healthy’ weight child, and in the other a picture of an overweight child. Photographs were, in fact, of the same girl — one was simply a digitally altered version, designed to add 20 pounds of weight.  After reading the essay, participants filled in a brief survey assessing the student and their essay, and also described their own beliefs about  biases in grading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, the team found that teachers believed characteristics such as race, gender, weight or attractiveness had “very little influence” on the grades they gave their students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But weight did in fact have a significant effect on the scores students received. Teachers were significantly more likely to recommend overweight students for tutoring or remedial help, judged their work as less neat than their non-overweight counterparts, and gave their essays lower grades overall — even though the essays were exactly the same. They also judged overweight students to have worked much harder than non-overweight students — perhaps because they were seen as less capable and therefore in greater need to try. Interestingly, even though teachers gave the overweight students lower grades, they didn’t consider the &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; of their essays to be any lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team suggests their findings illustrate the “weight-biased attitudes” often present in teachers: that although students can try just as hard or produce work of equally high quality, stereotypes about what it means to be overweight warp educators’ perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study only used images of white girls, so the way that weight interacts with other identities would be worth further research — how does weight interact with race, for example, and do the findings hold for male students, too? The team also notes that their research could be replicated with photographs that were not digitally altered or were full length, and the weight of teacher was also not taken into consideration: would an overweight teacher still hold the same biases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tackling bad body image in teenagers is a vital step towards the nurturing of happy, healthy adults. But to do that, deeply enmeshed attitudes towards weight will have to be undone. The first step may simply be acknowledging they exist — it’s notable that teachers were not aware that such biases affected the way they graded. Becoming more cognisant of the various factors that influence how we see other people is key. Overweight students are just as good: they should be treated as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjep.12322?af=R&quot;&gt;Weight bias and grading among middle and high school teachers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/609393366/0/oupblogpsychology/"/>
		<id>https://blog.oup.com/?p=143047</id>
		<updated>2019-11-16T14:30:07+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: An updated version of this article addresses the error where the author incorrectly states that the plural neuter term in Latin is “Latinae.” &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/the-truth-about-latinx/&quot;&gt;Please read the updated article here.&lt;/a&gt; We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the term &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinx&quot;&gt;Latinx&lt;/a&gt; has become popular in academic settings in English to designate a group of people without reference to gender, which is designated by -o and -a endings in some Romance languages. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://medium.com/@ThinkNowTweets/progressive-latino-pollster-trust-me-latinos-do-not-identify-with-latinx-63229adebcea&quot;&gt;While academics and Twitter users have begun to use the term, only 2% of the U.S. population actually identifies with this word. &lt;/a&gt; Latinx has become so widely used that Elizabeth Warren has taken to using it on the campaign trail.  This has led to a reflection on its political implications in a recent Ross Douthat piece &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://nyti.ms/2JSDPcK&quot;&gt;in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/a&gt; The interesting question is why a term that is thought to help unify a large group of people would fail to gain wider traction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Spanish is my mother tongue, I can understand why this term would befuddle Spanish speakers.  From a linguistic perspective, it makes no sense to create a genderless word in a gender-marked language. Yes, the -o and -a endings signal the grammatical gender, such as in the terms &lt;em&gt;niño and niña. &lt;/em&gt;But the endings for the adult form are not always straightforward, such as in &lt;em&gt;el&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;hombre &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;la&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;mujer.&lt;/em&gt; In fact, all nouns carry grammatical gender and some of these end in -o/a (i.e. &lt;em&gt;la tierra)&lt;/em&gt; and others do not (i.e. &lt;em&gt;el arbol&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Finally, even within categories that have similar meanings there can be variation. In Spanish, it’s &lt;em&gt;el puma &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; la pantera. &lt;/em&gt;But in Italian, one would say &lt;em&gt;la tigre. &lt;/em&gt;Confused yet? Grammatical gender is confusing, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://lightonspanish.com/the-gender-of-animals-in-spanish/&quot;&gt;especially with regard to animals.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all this confusion, Spanish speakers lose a connection between sex and gender. No one would be insulted if they are considered part of &lt;em&gt;el pueblo Latino &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;la gente Latina. &lt;/em&gt;Just because someone says I am part of &lt;em&gt;la gente Latina&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t make me feel that they are referring only to women. For a speaker of this class of Romance languages, the notion that gender and sex are the same thing makes little sense. Yes, gender originates in sex but it is not the same thing when it comes to non-sexed nouns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem arises when we use a gender-marked Romance language term in English contexts. For example, one day I ran across a cover for &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; that characterizes Selena as “&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onnewsstandsnow.com/collections/newsweek/products/newsweek-selena-the-life-and-legacy-of-tejanos-queen?variant=7841788788789&quot;&gt;Tejano’s Queen&lt;/a&gt;.” I was confused by this. Did they mean &lt;em&gt;Tejano’s&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. people from Texas) music?  The word music was never used so I kept on reading.  I found that the special issue was “proud to present Selena, a 100-page tribute to the most beloved Tejano singer of all time.” Oh, so she was a Tejano singer and the reference was to music.  But, in fact, she would be &lt;em&gt;una cantante de musica&lt;strong&gt;Tejana&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;una cantante &lt;strong&gt;Tejana&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Either way, the gender would be feminine not masculine. &lt;em&gt;Tejana&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Tejano &lt;/em&gt;had been masculinized to the latter. This is not unusual for Anglophones. You might remember the once Terminator, and now ex-Governator, Arnold Schwarzenegger stating “No problemo.” The problem (no pun intended) is that it should be &lt;em&gt;No hay problema.&lt;/em&gt; Again, an Anglophone (probably the scriptwriters) masculinizes a Spanish noun. Spanish has two genders but for some reason Anglophones think there is only one. Thus, what grammatical gender is and is not becomes entirely lost when moving to a language where gender and sex are the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let’s leave my linguistic perch for a second and think about the implications of the term &lt;em&gt;X &lt;/em&gt;is. The term &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is sought as one that would be all inclusive. The term reminds me of algebra where &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; represents a variable that has no defined meaning.  As such it is perfectly suited for equations where a term is unknown.  In this case, it can take on any value and in human terms would represent a more inclusive term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with creating a new genderless word, is that it already exists in gender-marked languages that have a true neuter. There are two languages that come to mind when thinking about the lexical origins of English. One is German and the other is Latin. Of these two languages, Latin has the perfect solution. Not only does it contain a neuter but it also has a plural neuter, &lt;em&gt;Latinae.&lt;/em&gt; Rather than using a synthetically and anglophonically derived ending such as &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, we could opt for a more organic one that has its roots in the language that has influenced speakers across the planet. In that sense, &lt;em&gt;Latinae&lt;/em&gt; is all-inclusive and derives from a language that sought to create a genderless ending system. Latin is the natural language of science and the one used to represent complex concepts in English. &lt;em&gt;Latinae &lt;/em&gt;gets rid of a sex and gender bias, it is inclusive, and was actually used for that reason. Let’s go with a genderless solution from a gender-marked language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you miss the &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, you could tune in for reruns of &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;. Here, you would be presented with the motto “The truth is out there,” which also applies to our search for a genderless all-inclusive term &lt;em&gt;Latinae&lt;/em&gt; to replace &lt;em&gt;Latino/a/x.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verum illic&lt;/em&gt;, the truth is out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: An updated version of this article addresses the error where the author incorrectly states that the plural neuter term in Latin is “Latinae.” &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/the-truth-about-latinx/&quot;&gt;Please read the updated article here.&lt;/a&gt; We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feature image credit:”Spanish dictionary” by Abigail Luke via &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.flickr.com/photos/185598731@N04/49090327886/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Flickr &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/a-linguists-perspective-on-the-popularity-of-the-word-latinx/&quot;&gt;The truth about ‘Latinx’&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/609393366/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/609393366/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/609393366/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/609393366/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/609393366/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/609393366/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/609393366/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/609393366/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/609393366/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/609393366/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/etymology-and-delusion-part-1/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Etymology and delusion, Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/completing-your-verbs-infinitive-and-gerunds/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Completing your verbs—infinitive and gerunds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2019/11/what-lies-behind-asias-thriving-shadow-education-industry/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;What lies behind Asia’s thriving shadow education industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Dialysis-140x110.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an open access BMC Series journal that publishes original peer-reviewed articles on all aspects of the prevention, diagnosis, and management of kidney and associated disorders. The journal has been publishing articles for almost 20 years and has amassed more than 2,500 articles specific to the medical field of nephrology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journal is proudly affiliated with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://renal.org/&quot;&gt;Renal Association&lt;/a&gt;, a UK-based kidney-specific professional body, which has published guidance on best practice in the management of patients with kidney disease since 1995. These guidelines have been accredited by the UK’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nice.org.uk/&quot;&gt;National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/RACPG&quot;&gt;selection of these guidelines&lt;/a&gt; continue to be published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mark the journal’s 20th year of publishing, members of the journal’s Editorial Board and the Editors are delighted to announce that we will be launching a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/tag/bmc-nephrology/&quot;&gt;journal-specific blog&lt;/a&gt; to highlight the journal’s high-quality and topical published articles, which are of broad interest to nephrologists and researchers in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is involved in &lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt; blogs? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce that the journal has welcomed two Blog Editors to the Editorial Board, Daphne Harrington Knicely and Su Thavarajah, from John Hopkins University School of Medicine. Su and Daphne will be selecting journal content to highlight and writing the blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; “I’m excited to collaborate with Su on the BMC Nephrology Blog.  We look forward to highlighting the innovative articles from &lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt; and connecting them to clinical practice and patient care.” – Daphne Harrington Knicely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11444&quot; style=&quot;width: 169px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-11444&quot; height=&quot;199&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Daphne-Knicely-240x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;159&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Dr. Daphne Harrington Knicely&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Daphne Harrington Knicely is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Daphne is committed to medical education with involvement in multiple teaching programs at Johns Hopkins. Daphne has a special interest in patient education and outcomes and is the co-director of patient education within the Division of Nephrology at Johns Hopkins. She helped establish the Johns Hopkins Nephrology Patient Education Program and is dedicated to improving kidney disease awareness. Daphne is a member of several committees for the National Kidney Foundation serving Maryland and Delaware and has special expertise in diabetic kidney disease, solitary kidney, and renal replacement therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope that the blog will serve as a great conversation starter and introduce these publications to a broader audience.  There is so much exciting work being done in the nephrology field that many of our colleagues are not aware of. We hope this blog brings this work to the forefront” – Su Thavarajah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11445&quot; style=&quot;width: 168px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-11445&quot; height=&quot;198&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Sumeska-Thavarajah-240x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;158&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Dr. Sumeska Thavarajah&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sumeska Thavarajah is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Su is committed to education and dedicated to bringing community awareness on kidney disease through her work with the National Kidney Foundation serving Maryland and Delaware. Su has served as the Chairman of its Medical Advisory Board for the last six years and has been a member of the board since 2012. Much of Su’s work has focused on the development of patient education programs for dialysis and transplant options. She has been honored with the National Kidney Foundation’s Linda Cameron Award for Patient Services, for donating her time at community health screenings and assisting the Programs &amp;amp; Advocacy committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adding a blog to &lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt; seems to be the natural next step to promote the journal, highlight our new scientific publications, and putting them in context of current scientific trend with the help of our experienced blog editors, Daphne and Su.” – Bernard Jaar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11446&quot; style=&quot;width: 166px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-11446&quot; height=&quot;206&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Bernard-Jaar-227x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;156&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Dr. Bernard Jaar&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also supporting this project will be Dr. Bernard Jaar, also an Assistant Professor at John Hopkins University Medical School and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He is an associate faculty of the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research and a Senior Staff nephrologist at the Nephrology Center of Maryland. Bernard has been a Section Editor for &lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt; since 2012 and has been committed to promoting the journal’s success since he was appointed. Bernard is actively involved in supporting the Editor team with peer review adjudication, journal development, and advocacy. For his dedication to the journal, he won Section Editor of the Year in 2014. Bernard leads the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/sections/epidemiology-and-health-outcomes&quot;&gt;Epidemiology and health outcomes&lt;/a&gt; section of the journal, with Deputy Section Editor, Dr. Laura Plantinga. Bernard is especially interested in the epidemiology of chronic kidney disease, survival in dialysis patients, and associated cardiovascular disease but also environmental factors and their effect on the kidney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I access the blogs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blogs will be posted regularly on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/tag/bmc-nephrology/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology &lt;/em&gt;blogs page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; We will also provide links to this page on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;journal’s homepage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could greater empathy help heal our current political divisions?&lt;/strong&gt; Not according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/empathy-is-tearing-us-apart/&quot;&gt;this &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; by Robert Wright. Researchers have found that more empathy for an “in group” may actually relate to greater hostility towards the “out group”. People with higher levels of empathy were more likely to be support no-platforming a speaker from an opposing party, for instance, and even showed more amusement when they read that a bystander in favour of that speaker had been hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38507&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Guardian’s&lt;/em&gt; “Science Weekly” podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2019/nov/08/taking-on-eysenck-one-mans-mission-to-challenge-a-giant-of-psychology-science-weekly-podcast&quot;&gt;focuses on the controversy surrounding work by Hans Eysenck&lt;/a&gt;, which purported to find strong links between personality and cancer risk&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s a great place to start if you haven’t been following the saga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/it-is-okay-to-lose-confidence-in-your-previous-research&quot;&gt;story by Dalmeet Singh Chawla&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Index &lt;/em&gt;highlights recent research from the “Loss of Confidence Project”, which aims to encourage scientists to declare when they’ve lost confidence in their past findings&lt;/strong&gt;. Half of respondents to an online survey said they’d lost confidence in some of their previous results, due to a combination of mistakes, misjudgements, and questionable research practices. However, less than 20% had publicly reported these doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The latest trend to sweep Silicon Valley is so-called “dopamine fasting,” in which people abstain from pleasurable or stimulating experiences for a period of time&lt;/strong&gt;. Is it perhaps just a fancy way of saying “taking a break”, couched in some pseudo-neuroscientific language? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/11/13/20959424/dopamine-fasting-silicon-valley-trend-neuroscience&quot;&gt;Sigal Samuel has the answers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media has changed the way we interact and communicate with each other — and in doing so, has threatened democracy as we know it&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s the argument of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/12/social-media-democracy/600763/&quot;&gt;feature in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Jonathan Haidt and Tobias Rose-Stockwell, which touches on some of the same issues we’ve explored here at &lt;em&gt;Research Digest&lt;/em&gt; this week, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/13/the-paradox-of-viral-outrage-public-shaming-inspires-further-outrage-but-also-increases-sympathy-for-the-offender/&quot;&gt;outrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/14/psychological-study-of-moral-grandstanding-helps-explain-why-social-media-is-so-toxic/&quot;&gt;moral grandstanding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pigs can now be added to the elite group of animals that are able to use tools&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/add-another-animal-to-the-list-of-tool-users-pigs/&quot;&gt;reports Karinna Hurley&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers at a zoo in Paris observed a Visayan warty pig called Priscilla using bits of bark to help dig out a nest. Other pigs even seemed to have learned the skill from her, they found. Check &lt;span&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the digging pigs in this video:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And finally, we recently reported on a study &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/15/the-stereotype-of-the-narcissistic-only-child-is-widespread-but-its-wrong/&quot;&gt;debunking the myth&lt;/a&gt; of the narcissistic only child — but there are also&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; other incorrect stereotypes that only children face. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;At &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Ana Aznar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/myths-about-only-children-debunked-126127&quot;&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that whether or not we have siblings makes very little difference to our personality, social skills or mental health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 In what the editor of a psychiatry journal says in an unusual case, the authors of a paper on treatments for depression have retracted it after being alerted to “inconsistencies” stemming from a change to their study design that the peer reviewers had requested.  Here’s the retraction notice, in The Journal of Nervous and Mental … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2019/11/15/reviewers-asked-authors-to-change-their-study-design-it-apparently-didnt-go-well/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Reviewers asked authors to change their study design.

&lt;p&gt;What is it about social media that makes discussions about controversial topics so caustic and unpleasant? A variety of reasons have been put forward — such as the tendency for outrage to self-perpetuate, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/13/the-paradox-of-viral-outrage-public-shaming-inspires-further-outrage-but-also-increases-sympathy-for-the-offender/&quot;&gt;we reported earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;. But now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223749&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;PLoS One&lt;/em&gt;, implicates a concept so far explored in philosophy rather than psychology. This is “moral grandstanding” — publicly opining on morality and politics to impress others, and so to seek social status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38492&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;To engage in moral grandstanding, it’s the motivation behind the comments or statements that really matters: the individual is seeking to gain status, rather than simply to express their sincerely-held beliefs. Moral grandstanding can take many forms, the researchers write: “in a quest to impress peers, someone may trump up moral charges, pile on in cases of public shaming, announce that anyone who disagrees with them is obviously wrong, or exaggerate emotional displays in taking ideological positions.” They may also ramp up the situation, seeking to out-do others in their outrage. This concern with increasing one’s influence, rank or social status is, of course, a common characteristic of discourse on social media.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Given its relationship with status-seeking, Joshua Grubbs at Bowling Green State University and colleagues figured that moral grandstanding should also be amenable to examination as a psychological phenomenon. They hypothesised that it would be characterised by strivings for dominance or prestige, and may be associated with personality traits related to status-seeking, such as narcissism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The team first designed a questionnaire to assess dominance- and prestige-seeking as sub-scales of “moral grandstanding motivations”. The ultimate short-form, 10-item scale asks participants the extent to which they agree or disagree (on a 7-point scale) with statements including “My moral/political beliefs should be inspiring to others” (relating to prestige) and “I share my moral/political beliefs to make people who disagree with me feel bad” (relating to dominance).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;In the first three studies — two on groups of students, and one on a nationally representative group of more than 1,000 US participants — the team administered their scale, plus a battery of other tests, including personality tests, questions about political affiliation and measures of the participants’ experience of political or moral conflict (whether — and how often — they’d experienced conflict in the home or got into fights on social media, for example, because of their political and moral beliefs).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;They found consistent results. Higher scores on prestige-seeking were associated with narcissistic extraversion and extraversion more generally, while the dominance aspects were strongly associated with narcissistic antagonism (a willingness to exploit others for personal gains), and related to lower conscientiousness, agreeableness and openness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Political ideology had no relationship with moral grandstanding scores. But higher scores on both sub-scales did correlate with greater reported conflict with people holding different political and moral views (and this wasn’t simply because of differences in participants’ personality traits).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further, month-long study provided preliminary evidence that individual differences in moral grandstanding are relatively stable over time. In this study, the team also found evidence that while dominance-related motivations predicted conflict with people with differing views on political and moral issues, prestige-seekers reported growing closer to other people with the same views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final study of 1,776 US adults revealed that both prestige- and dominance-strivings were associated with more self-reported social media behaviours consistent with grandstanding — re-posting something that a participant disagreed with to make fun of it, or reposting something that they agreed with to make themselves look good, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;“Collectively, these findings provide support for an account of moral grandstanding that conceptualises it as a status-seeking behaviour that is driven by status-seeking motives,” and that could explain some of the problems with social discourse, especially on social media, the team writes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;None&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The researchers do acknowledge limitations to their study. It relied on self-reports of conflicts and social media behaviour, for example. More work should now be done to build on the preliminary evidence, they argue, in part because of the urgent need to understand the potential real-world implications. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The long-term implications of grandstanding are not yet known,” they write, “though, should philosophical speculation hold true, it is likely that this phenomenon is associated with polarisation and break-downs in effective communication, particularly with outgroup members or in-group members whom one perceives as a rival.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223749&quot;&gt;Moral grandstanding in public discourse: Status-seeking motives as a potential explanatory mechanism in predicting conflict&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/smartphone-586944-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social Media platforms, primarily used for networking, also serve as an invaluable source of knowledge on variety of topics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM11/paper/view/2880/3264&quot;&gt;including health of the population&lt;/a&gt;. Such knowledge can be effectively utilised by healthcare professionals and decision makers if the appropriate techniques are employed to deal with high-volume, high-velocity, high-variety, and often arguable veracity user-generated content online. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-019-0921-x&quot;&gt;research article&lt;/a&gt;, published this month in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making&lt;/a&gt;, the authors aimed to investigate the potential of Twitter data for Hay Fever surveillance purposes and validate the effectiveness of &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;relevant&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; content curation using state-of-the-art Deep Learning models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11415 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/cell-phone-1245663_960_720-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why health surveillance from Social Media?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2014.01.002&quot;&gt;Numerous studies&lt;/a&gt; have already demonstrated that Twitter users openly share health-related information (i.e. symptoms, treatments) with their online networks. So far, real-time surveillance of infectious diseases (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2145600&amp;amp;picked=formats&quot;&gt;Influenza&lt;/a&gt;) from Social Media has been extensively investigated in literature, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7403639&quot;&gt;while allergic conditions still remain largely unexplored&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/chronic-respiratory-conditions/allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever/contents/allergic-rhinitis&quot;&gt;1 in 5 Australian suffered from Hay Fever in 2014-15&lt;/a&gt;, becoming one of the most common chronic respiratory diseases. Due to environmental changes and increasing pollution, Pollen Allergy is dangerously on the rise, not only in Australia, but also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldallergy.org/wao-white-book-on-allergy&quot;&gt;worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current attempts to Hay Fever estimation include either official statistics or marketing polls. More recently, the data obtained from GP prescriptions, hospital admissions, pollen rates, and antihistamine sales have been utilised. Existing approaches are both time-consuming and cost-intensive, and provide only a high level of detail about the condition (usually answers to pre-specified questions). Given the limitations, Social Media has become an attractive alternative as the real-time data is extracted automatically in an unobtrusive manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11416 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/allergy-1738191_960_720-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;Challenges associated with user-generated content&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the wealth of knowledge available on Social Media platforms, the raw form of user-generated content proves highly challenging in &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;relevant&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; content extraction (i.e. &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Hay Fever self-reports) due to a large number of advertisements, news, warnings, etc. (even though still related to Hay Fever). What is more, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/educ.1120.0105&quot;&gt;user-written posts frequently abound in grammatical errors, ambiguous phrases, creative expressions, and so on&lt;/a&gt;. For example, how to automatically identify that tweet &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘I’m not crying, it’s my Hay Fever playing up’ &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt;refers to the most common Hay Fever symptom (watery eyes)? Or how to train the system to recognise that &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;Telfast&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is the commercial name of popular Hay Fever medication without the extensive list of &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of the potential medications provided a priori?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deep Learning as promising solution for challenging content curation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in Machine Learning, in particular its sub-field called Deep Learning, show great promise in highly challenging user-generated content curation. Providing system with even relatively small sample of class positive and class negative examples (in natural language), and letting the model to identify the most distinctive features between both classes, has already proved successful in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29155996&quot;&gt;healthcare domain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.3390/app9061123&quot;&gt;beyond&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the implementation of state-of-the-art in Natural Language Processing word embeddings into the model training further improves the accuracy and robustness of the approach. That is, word-to-vector representation (word embedding) allows to account for syntactic and semantic linkages between words (&lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;similar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; words occur in &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;similar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; contexts). This is due to a nearby position of the conceptually-related terms in the projected vector space (e.g. &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;bee&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;honey&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are closer to &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;pollen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;spores&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;fossils&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt;). As a result, &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;tears&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; can be linked to &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;watery eyes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;sniffles&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;runny nose&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; without explicit rules definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;Case study of Hay Fever surveillance from Twitter in Australia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study conducted in Australia aimed to investigate the potential of Twitter data for Hay Fever surveillance purposes and validate the effectiveness of &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;relevant&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; content curation using state-of-the-art Deep Learning models (still in infancy in health informatics domain). The primary data was extracted over the 6-month period, covering the high pollen season. The number Hay Fever self-reports from Twitter users peaked around October and November, as expected. The accuracy of relevant posts detection (e.g. symptoms, treatments) was up to 88% for the highest performing model (GRU) and pre-trained word embeddings (GloVe). The major contribution of our work includes the implicit symptoms and emerging treatments automatic detection, without pre-defined rules specification. The results prove promising for real-time health surveillance from an alternative source such as Social Media source, and serves as an attractive complement to currently limited approaches to Pollen Allergy prevalence and severity estimation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-019-4621-0&quot;&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Health Services Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that locating Independent Domestic Violence Advisors (IDVAs) in hospitals is an effective  response to domestic violence and abuse (DVA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DVA includes a range of types of abuse, including, but not limited to, physical, psychological, financial, sexual or emotional abuse. DVA can have severe health consequences, with survivors at higher risk of experiencing anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, loss of trust, suicidal behaviours and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halliwell &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;present findings from a multi-site evaluation of hospital-based IDVAs conducted in the UK. Hospital IDVAs provide immediate support and advice to victims of domestic abuse, link victims to community-based support and provide hospital staff with expert training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study highlights the advantages of locating IDVAs in hospitals: IDVAs are more likely to engage with survivors at an earlier point in the abusive relationship, identify “hidden” survivors not visible to other services and provide access to longer-term community interventions and health-based services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of hospital-based IDVAs, however the study suggests these services offer a unique opportunity of effectively helping victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Geriatrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;strong&gt;Anticholinergic and benzodiazepine medication use and risk of incidence of dementia: a UK cohort study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recurrent prescribing of some common anticholinergic drugs may increase dementia risk, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1280-2&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; reveals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is at present no cure for dementia. However, dementia can be prevented by acting on modifiable risk factors. Long-term use of several medications such as anticholinergics and benzodiazepines has been suggested to increase dementia risk. These medications are highly used among adults for conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, depression, epilepsy and insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11425 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/old-walking-2-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Geriatrics &lt;/a&gt;gathers data from a UK prospective, multicentre cohort study, specifically designed to estimate the prevalence, risk factors and course of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings demonstrate that at 10 year follow-up, recurrent use of anticholinergic medications classed as ACB3 according to the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden scale (medications that may cause delirium) are associated with dementia. The cognitive decline particularly affects patients with a good baseline cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study indicates that long-term anticholinergic use should be avoided in older people. Anticholinergic use represents therefore a potentially important modifiable risk factor for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– &lt;strong&gt;How organisations promoting vaccination respond to misinformation on social media: a qualitative investigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organisations promoting vaccines face multiple challenges on social media, including spread of false information and anti-science attitudes. Misinformation relating to vaccines poses a significant health threat. It is associated with decrease in vaccination rates and a risk of disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media is a place where you don’t need to support your claims…It’s kind of like the Wild West in terms of making claims about immunisation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-7659-3&quot;&gt;Steffens &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; explored the strategies, perspectives and experiences of Australian professionals working to promote vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/a&gt; provides a better understanding of the current vaccine hesitancy and provides clear recommendations to address vaccine misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on their findings, the authors highlighted the need to engage with audiences to build trust, to respond to concerns about risks and communicate with openness prioritizing facts. The study also encourages partnership with organisations sharing similar values to create a strong collective pro-vaccine voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– &lt;strong&gt;A prospective study of maternal postnatal depressive symptoms with infant-feeding practices in a Chinese birth cohort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postnatal depression (PND) is a mental disorder characterized by a persistent low mood in new mothers. It is a serious condition that can affect mother´s ability to bond with the baby and have long-term consequences for the infant development and cognition.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11427 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/baby-feeding-200x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2559-1&quot;&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/a&gt; explored infant feeding behaviours among women who experienced PND in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results show that women with symptoms of PND have shorter breastfeeding duration, are at higher risk of exclusive breastfeeding cessation at 6 months and more likely to provide the supplementary formula to their infants in the first year of life. The study highlights the importance of screening for symptoms of PND as one of the possible factors of adverse feeding outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Bioinformatics&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– &lt;strong&gt;PlantSimLab: a modelling and simulation web tool for plant biologists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the molecular level, complex molecular networks control many biological processes. Integration of experimental biology and mathematical modelling is a valuable approach to study biological systems. However, one of the challenges faced by life scientists, is they usually lack the expertise to use mathematical models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11429 alignright&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/scientists-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-3094-9&quot;&gt;Ha &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; present a new tool that helps plant scientists use mathematical models for hypothesis generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PlantSimLab software was developed with the focus on plant biology with a team of plant biologist determining the different features and functionalities. This tool can be used by biologists without direct assistance from mathematicians or computer science specialists. The tool enables users to build, validate and use dynamic models to test hypothesis and explore results.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-6094&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/woman-sitting-on-chair-while-looking-upwards-3126016-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;On February 21, 1875, one year before Alexander Graham Bell filed his patent for the telephone, a baby girl, Jeanne Louise Calment, was born in Arles, France. She was alive to witness the invention of the aeroplane, the cinema, on a trip to Paris, saw the Eiffel Tower being built and she reported she met Vincent Van Gogh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In 1997, the same year Princess Diana died, Calment finally passed away. She was 122 years and 164 days old. Although blind, almost deaf and confined to a wheelchair, Calment reportedly remained spirited and ‘alert as a hummingbird’ till the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The French called her ‘la doyenne de l’humanitè’ (the elder of humankind). Despite the occasional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/study-questions-age-worlds-oldest-woman-180971153/&quot;&gt;counter-claim&lt;/a&gt;, she still holds the &lt;a href=&quot;http://guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-person-(female)&quot;&gt;record&lt;/a&gt; for the world’s longest-ever living human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the final article of a series of lessons in brain health from our elders — those folk who lived the longest and healthiest. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calment lived an extraordinary life for a woman of her generation. She attended school until the age of sixteen and graduated with a diploma. At twenty-one she married a wealthy distant cousin and recounted to biographers the details of their active lifestyle within the upper society of Arles, pursuing hobbies such as fencing, cycling, mountaineering, swimming, hunting, playing piano and painting, and going to the opera in Marseilles. ‘I had fun; I am having fun,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her life was not without sadness. Calment survived her husband, her daughter Yvonne who died at thirty-six in 1934 and her grandson Frédéric who died in 1963.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked her secret to old age, Jeanne Calment attributed her longevity to immunity to stress and a good attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t afraid of anything. I was often reproached for that. I took pleasure when I could, I acted clearly and morally and without regret. I’m very lucky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calment reportedly ate more than two pounds of chocolate a week, treated her skin with olive oil, rode a bicycle until she was 100, and only quit smoking when she was 117 because she became too proud to ask someone else to light her cigarettes! Known for her wit, she is widely reported as saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve never had but one wrinkle, and I’m sitting on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard work, raw eggs, biking and no regrets. We clamour to learn their secrets, and typically the oldest of the old love to share their long-won wisdom. Calment once quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wait. For death and journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In an impressive feat of brain plasticity, an enriching life experience changed Jeanne Calment’s brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;When she was 118, the neuropsychologist, Karen Ritchie, visited a number of times over a six-month period to examine Calment and submit her to a battery of neuropsychological tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ritchie &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/drm/007/3-4.pdf&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Until this programme of testing was commenced J.C. had no contact with the outside world apart from the occasional greeting from medical staff and an annual visit from journalists on the occasion of her birthday. For the last three years she has spent her days alone in her room in her armchair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to records, Calment enjoyed contributing to the study by recalling the poems, fables and songs she had learned as a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;I don’t lack for anything. I have everything I need. I’ve had a good life. I live in my dreams, in my memories, beautiful memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Brain scans showed atrophy of Calment’s cortex, but her overall cognitive performance was, in fact, far better than might have been predicted from the extent of brain loss observed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There is no evidence at present of senile dementia . . . Executive functions (principally controlled by frontal areas), while having deteriorated from young adult levels, appear to be relatively spared . . . This raises the question of whether an initially high level of intellectual ability may have been a protective factor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Remarkably, over the six months of Ritchie conducting the testing program, Calment’s test scores &lt;em&gt;improved&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Her verbal recall, narrative recall, verbal fluency and mathematics scores improved from baseline to match those of the average seventy-five to eighty-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Environmental enrichment by way of social interaction from Ritchie and her team activated the latent plasticity in Calment’s exceptionally long-lived brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Jeanne Calment no doubt had memories that she didn’t share but there was one secret that she wanted to pass on: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Always keep your sense of humour. That’s what I attribute my long life to. I think I’ll die laughing. That’s part of my program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/bats-ntds_Image-4-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8883 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/bats-ntds_Image-4-1-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In the Northwest Indian state of Nagaland, local ethnic groups have conducted bat harvests for many generations as a source of food and traditional medicine. Now, authors of a recent PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0007733&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; show that these Nagaland bats may carry Ebola viruses, with the first report of filovirus reactive antibodies in both humans and bats in a region with no historical record of Ebola virus disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors note: “Our results reinforce the need to select sentinel sites for virus surveillance at the human-animal interface and highlights some of the gaps in our understanding of filovirus transmission and ecology,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/iceman-image_oct-blog.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8884 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/iceman-image_oct-blog-300x169.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ötzi the Iceman is a 5,300-year-old human mummy found frozen in ice approximately 3,200 meters above sea level in the Italian Alps. The preservation of his body, clothing, and gear is remarkable—and that’s not all. He was found alongside an abundant assemblage of plants and fungi, the subject of this recent PLOS ONE study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tiny flora provide big clues to the Iceman’s fate: 70% of the identified plant and fungi species are non-local and were transported to the spot in Ötzi’s gut and clothing or by mammalian herbivores whose droppings ended up frozen alongside the Iceman. These non-local species help confirm the path Ötzi took to his final resting place: several of the identified moss species thrive today in the lower Schnalstal valley, suggesting that Ötzi traveled along the valley during his ascent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author James Dickson adds: “Most members of the public are unlikely to be knowledgeable about bryophytes (mosses and liverworts). However, no fewer than 75 species of these important investigative clues were found when the Iceman (aka Ötzi) was removed from the ice. They were recovered as mostly small scraps from the ice around him, from his clothes and gear, and even from his alimentary tract. Those findings prompted the questions: Where did the fragments come from? How precisely did they get there? How do they help our understanding of the Iceman?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors painted two cows with white zebra-like stripes, two with black stripes, and left two cows unpainted as controls. After nine days, a mere 55 flies were observed on the zebra cows, compared with 111 on the black-painted cows and 128 on the control cows. Furthermore, the zebra-striped cows demonstrated fewer fly-repelling behaviors (like flicking their tails and shaking their heads) compared with the black-striped and control cows. These results suggest that painting zebra-esque stripes on cattle can prevent biting fly attacks without the use of pesticide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spend any amount of time online and you’re likely to see the same patterns repeat themselves over and over again: somebody says something offensive or controversial on social media, they’re met with anger and disgust, and they either apologise or double down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some, this cycle has become somewhat of a career, with the garnering of outrage forming the backbone of their (often incredibly tedious) public personas. But does responding to such toxic or offensive remarks, especially en masse, actually work? Or does it simply increase sympathy for the offender, no matter how bigoted their remarks were to begin with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550619853595&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science,&lt;/em&gt; the latter is more likely. The paper looked at the impact of viral outrage on convincing observers that an offender is blameworthy — and found that as outrage increased, observers believed it was “more normative” to express condemnation, but simultaneously believed that outrage was excessive and felt more sympathy for the offender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38476&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across seven studies, Takuya Sawaoka and Benoît Monin from Stanford University showed 3,406 participants offensive social media posts, such as a woman taking a selfie at a concentration camp and a man making a sexist comment about the Women’s March in 2017 — all inspired by things that had really gone viral. The number of outraged reactions was manipulated across conditions — in the non-viral outrage condition, participants read two outraged responses, with those in the other condition were shown ten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first few studies, participants were shown the post and asked to indicate how offensive and how funny they found it on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 7 (very). They then read the responses condemning the post, also inspired by real comments on the event, and were asked another set of questions. These included questions about intentionality, such as “how much do you think the poster intended to hurt people with what they said?”, and others relating to whether the participant believed the poster should be punished by the social media platform or by their friends and employers. Participants were also asked how sympathetic and outraged they were by the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that viral outrage was frequently perceived as disproportionate, leading to increased sympathy for the poster compared to the non-viral condition. But despite their sympathy, participants didn’t express any less condemnation for the poster when outrage was viral. That seemed to be because higher levels of outrage also meant participants felt condemnation was the norm, making them both &lt;span&gt;feel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;more outrage themselves and more likely to express it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In further studies, the team found the same pattern of results, regardless of how offensive the original post was, and whether the poster was a lay person or a high-status public figure. And interestingly, one study also showed that participants believed others were less sympathetic and more outraged than they were themselves — meaning concerns over so-called “outrage culture” may be overlooking how sympathetic we really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research highlights what the team describes as the “strange bedfellows” of outrage and sympathy: the complex, sometimes counterintuitive, interaction between the two. And while it may be a common way of expressing moral judgement, the team concludes that outrage has “limited efficacy” when it comes to actually persuading people that someone has committed a moral misstep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the research couldn’t reveal is how people respond when outraged comments don’t just number in the tens but in the thousands. When posts really do go viral, they have significantly more &lt;span&gt;than just two or ten &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;responses, and it’s unclear how this changes the way we respond — though the team speculates that it would only strengthen people’s beliefs that condemnation was excessive and increase their sympathy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would also be interesting to understand how viral outrage impacts social norms in a broader sense: whilst sympathy may increase in individual cases, does widespread, vocal outrage actually help change wider attitudes around sexism, racism or transphobia, for example?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might not be able to stop yourself responding to the next outrageous thing you see on your Twitter or Facebook feed — and when it comes to bigotry, that instinct is probably a good one. But, as this study shows, it may also be worth thinking of other strategies to ensure that deeply offensive beliefs are stamped out of public life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550619853595&quot;&gt;Outraged but Sympathetic: Ambivalent Emotions Limit the Influence of Viral Outrage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a short notification that the two neuroscience planets have moved to the
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; URL space. They can now be found at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuroblog.fedoraproject.org/planet-neuroscientists/&quot;&gt;Planet Neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuroblog.fedoraproject.org/planet-neuroscience/&quot;&gt;Planet Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planet instances on my personal space will remain functional for the next
few weeks till the end of November, after which I'll stop updating them. Please
update your links/bookmarks. Since this is all hosted on Github pages, setting
up permanent redirects is not easy but we'll see what we can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuroblog.fedoraproject.org/planet-neuroscientists/&quot;&gt;Planet Neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt; collects RSS feeds from various neuroscience blogs
and web-sites. This is a good read for non-experts. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuroblog.fedoraproject.org/planet-neuroscience/&quot;&gt;Planet Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, on
the other hand, collects RSS feeds from various publication sources. So, the
main content here will consists of peer-reviewed publications and pre-prints.
They are updated twice a day at the moment, which seems to work well enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add both these to your RSS feed reader by using the &quot;Feeds&quot; drop-down
in the top right hand corner. You can also download the complete blog-roll
there and choose individual feeds to add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are both hosted on the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/neurofedora&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora Github space&lt;/a&gt;. You can suggest more feeds to be added to
the planets too, either by opening an issue/pull request in the Github source
repositories, or by getting in touch with the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; team via any of our
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/communicating/&quot;&gt;communication channels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is volunteer driven initiative and contributions in any form always
welcome.  You can get in touch with us &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/overview/#_communicating_and_getting_help&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
We are happy to help you learn the skills needed to contribute to the project.
In fact, that is one of the major goals of the initiative---to spread technical
knowledge that is necessary to develop software for Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Deepak Panday will talk about the paper &quot;Unsupervised Feature Selection for Large Data sets&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last decade saw a considerable increase in the availability
of data. Unfortunately, this increase was overshadowed by various
technical difficulties that arise when analysing large data sets.
These include long processing times, large requirements for data
storage, and other technical issues related to the analysis of
high-dimensional data sets. By consequence, reducing the cardinality
of data sets (with minimum information loss) has become of interest
to virtually any data scientist. Many feature selection algorithms
have been introduced in the literature, however, there are two main
issues with these. First, the vast majority of such algorithms
require labelled samples to learn from. One should note it is often
too expensive to label a meaningful amount of data, particularly
when dealing with large data sets. Second, these algorithms were
not designed to deal with the volume of data we have nowadays.
This paper introduces a novel unsupervised feature selection
algorithm designed specifically to deal with large data sets.
Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Molecular_model_of_the_pre-pore_form_of_a_MACPF_protein_based_upon_the_structure_of_pneunolysin-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11383&quot; style=&quot;width: 294px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-11383&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/one.png&quot; width=&quot;284&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Fig 1: Lipids phase separate into hydrophobic bilayers&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipids are insoluble in water, so they are synthesized in a membrane bilayer that makes a separate phase, like a layer of oil forming on water (Figure 1). Since most lipid-synthesizing enzymes are localised to just one membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotic cells or the inner membrane of bacteria, there is a major question: how can lipids transfer to another membrane? A method that might work on the face of it is traffic of vesicles made&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from membrane patches. However, the data do not support this. Traffic of vesicles in eukaryotic cells cannot provide lipids to organelles such as lipid droplets, mitochondria and peroxisomes. Even more definitively, the vast majority of cells that require lipid traffic are bacteria with 2 membranes (such as &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;), which have no membrane vesicles. This means that life on earth solved the question of lipid traffic long before vesicular traffic evolved. This paper is part of a trend to return the field of lipid transfer back to it’s roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11384&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11384&quot; height=&quot;163&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/two-300x163.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Fig 2: Lipids, by analogy with crude oil, can be transported in small discrete amounts (barrels) or larger continuous amounts in pipes&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipids are trafficked to their intended location by Lipid Transfer Proteins (LTPs). These come in two types: ‘boxy’ LTPs that resemble lidded boxes that can select cargo lipids for transport across water filled gaps such as the cytosol, like an oil barrel that can be filled with crude oil; and ‘groovy’ LTPs that resemble half-pipes through which large quantities of cargo can flow (Figure 2). The pipes are relative new discoveries that suggest the intriguing possibility that lipids can simply slide from one membrane to another at so-called “membrane contact sites” where membranes come closest together. The typical gaps at these sites is 15-20 nm, which matches the lengths of the known half-pipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11385&quot; style=&quot;width: 315px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-11385&quot; height=&quot;414&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/three-221x300.png&quot; width=&quot;305&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Fig 3: LEFT: four types of “Groovy” LTPs have been identified in the intermembrane space (IMS) of bacteria: two pure TULIPs, one Chorein-N, which combines with a -taco rod, and one mixed. RIGHT: eukaryotic cells contain many TULIPs and Chorein-N LTPs at membrane contact sites, for example at ER-mitochondrial junctions. Mitochondria in some species have homologues of the bacterial Chorein-N protein. Transmembrane domains and protein receptors anchor LTPs to membranes to stabilise them in bridging conformations&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The featured paper by Tim Levine (UCL, United Kingdom) predicts the existence of multiple bacterial homologues of the two LTPs folds known to form “groovy” LTPs inside eukaryotic cells. One fold is the &lt;u&gt;tu&lt;/u&gt;bular &lt;u&gt;lip&lt;/u&gt;id binding (TULIP) superfamily, which have quite short hydrophobic grooves (up to 7 nm long) – too short to stretch all the way between two membranes where they contact one another. The other “groovy” fold is the Chorein-N domain found at the N-terminus of various proteins including the human protein chorein. The first description of this protein as a half-pipe in 2018 revolutionised thinking about lipid transfer. Chorein has the internal capacity to hold many lipids (&amp;gt;20), forms rods 20 nm long, and is localised to sites where two membranes come very close together. The featured paper shows that domains that are strongly homologous either to TULIPs or Chorein-N (and in some cases both) are widespread in bacteria (Figure 3). In addition, there are previously unknown homologues in mitochondria, presumably inherited from the bacterial ancestor of these symbiotic organelles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prediction of likely bacterial homologues of these LTPs points to what experiments should be done next to investigate modes of “groovy” lipid transfer in bacteria, the most simple and tractable cellular system. This can bring us a lot closer to working out how lipids reach their destinations in all cells.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/11/OS-blog_Nov-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog is part of our series on the Future of Open Science. Read previous posts &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/category/future-of-open-series/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Open Access has provided us the opportunity—and the responsibility—to think about how scientific inquiry and discoveries are presented to a broader community. So how can we ensure credibility in research communication &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;assessment? One answer to that is preregistration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Preregistration enables authors to deposit their hypothesis and study design or submit it for peer review at a journal before they begin conducting experiments. Why is that important? Earlier documentation and review can help address two persistent scientific problems: increasing the credibility of results and reducing the amount of time it takes to make scientific knowledge available. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More Complete Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Scientific discovery often begins with a question. Researchers then design a study that will test this hypothesis and ultimately inform the work of future researchers. But that work is not evaluated until the experiment is complete. Staging peer review at the end of research cycle puts a lot of focus on the results, and introduces the potential for bias.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Whether it’s the publisher’s inclination to give surprising results more consideration, the reviewers’ tendency to give more credence to results that support their own views, or the author’s inclination to highlight positive results and leave out null or negative outcomes; focusing on results can leave a lot of excellent research and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5696751/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;hard-earned knowledge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; on the cutting room floor. In so doing, we forget the aim of science is to investigate and ultimately add to our understanding of a subject—whether or not the outcome is what we expected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;By documenting this initial phase of research and opening it up to peer review, researchers get earlier feedback and the opportunity to collaboratively craft the best study design possible before conducting their experiments. By depositing or publishing this initial work, researchers are committing to follow a certain approach and ensuring that the final article—whatever the outcome may be—will be evaluated for its thoroughness and rigor. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Less Time to Publish&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Science is happening everyday, but we don’t have access to that knowledge until the work is complete. Scientific investigation is often under-way for years before researchers are able to write up their findings and submit a research article to a journal for peer review. That can take some time too. Between review, revision, and the possibility of submitting to multiple journals before your work finds the right home, it can take several additional months for that work to publish. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Not only does earlier assessment through preregistration make sense for producing the best science, it can also reduce the amount of time from completion to publication. Authors who receive a provisional acceptance at a journal based on their hypothesis and approach won’t need to shop their final article around to multiple publishers in order to find the right fit for their work, streamlining the submission and publication process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Increasing Trust in Science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Even if you’re not a scientist, preregistration has its benefits. As readers, policymakers, and professionals who rely on scientific research, preregistration provides an extra assurance of the credibility of the results. By counteracting implicit biases in the review process and encouraging authors and publishers to present more complete findings, we also get access to an unfiltered scientific record. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Preregistration is still in its early days, but it’s something we’ve been thinking about a lot at PLOS, and you can expect to hear more updates from us soon. Until then, stay tuned for next month’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/category/future-of-open-series/&quot;&gt;Open Science&lt;/a&gt; post where we look at how Open helps increase reproducibility. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By guest blogger &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rhi_willmot?lang=en&quot;&gt;Rhi Willmot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is your mental library a haven of accurate and well-informed facts, or are there mistruths hiding on the shelves? It’s natural to assume that we update our beliefs in line with the most recent and well-established evidence. But what really happens to our views when a celebrity endorses a product that becomes discredited by science, or when a newspaper publishes a story which is later retracted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcpy.1135?casa_token=vTrfj0IhcAQAAAAA%3AZszrlG9yF_KC10vGTmS2AQ6A3WzOUtRQDDD7Fs77OQu6J0TN12DqpLDH5Pf6tnDhA-wjT-fkMqziQSl5AA&quot;&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/em&gt; presents a novel take on this topic, by investigating the &lt;em&gt;continued influence effect. &lt;/em&gt;Anne Hamby and colleagues suggest that our likelihood of continuing to believe retracted information depends on whether or not it helps us to understand the cause-and-effect structure of an event. Crucially, the team proposes, we would rather have a complete understanding of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; things happen than a perspective which is more accurate, but less complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38462&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first study, participants read a scenario in which an unwell character takes medication that fails to cure him. Whilst one group was informed the drug was ineffective because the character took it at the wrong time, the other group was given no explanation. Both groups were told the character took the medication with a glass of lemonade, and were then informed the drug is ineffective if consumed with citrus-based drinks. Later, all participants were notified that this last fact was untrue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day later, participants were asked to recall why the drug had been ineffective. Those who received no explanation for the drug failure in the original anecdote were more likely to incorrectly reference the lemonade drink as the reason why the medication didn’t work — even though most remembered that this information had later been retracted. This suggests information we later discover to be false is harder to ignore when it fills an explanatory “gap” in a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea was further supported by a second study, in which participants read the following extract from a successful poker player: “I reach down and pull out my bottle of kombucha which I like to drink at poker matches. I take a long deep swig from the bottle. And I have clarity of mind. I fold.” One group of participants was informed kombucha supports mental performance whilst another group was told the drink increases muscular function. This allowed those in the mental performance group to infer a link between kombucha drinking and poker success, whereas the muscular performance group could not. Later, all individuals were told the link between kombucha and mental performance or muscular function was untrue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants who read that kombucha was related to mental performance were more likely to recall the false information as true, and more likely to attribute it to the poker player’s win. When offered a selection of beverages to drink after the experiment, this group was also more likely to select kombucha. Again, it seems that when information supports our understanding of a story’s cause-and-effect structure, it is particularly “sticky”, even when we are told it isn’t true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a final study, the team repeated the original failed-medication scenario, but gave half the sample a positive ending to the story, in which the patient changes other aspects of his routine and improves. The other half were given a negative ending, in which the patient is unable to receive further treatment and does not get better. The researchers found the retracted information about citrus drinks had less of a continued influence on those who read the negative ending. They suggest this is because we are more motivated to accurately understand what leads to negative outcomes, as this will help us survive similar experiences in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a whole, it seems we have a general bias toward creating a complete mental picture of an event, rather than one that is factually accurate but lacking a cause-and-effect explanation. However, Hamby and colleagues also indicate this bias can be overcome when we recognise that prioritising accuracy over completeness will help us in future, or when a retraction offers an alternative explanation for the cause-and-effect structure of an event. Research such as this therefore makes us more aware of the chinks in our mental armour — and better equipped to defend them.&lt;/p&gt;

 In May of this year, François-Xavier Coudert, a chemist at PSL University in Paris, had a question about a paper in Chemistry: A European Journal. Several days later, he had an answer — sort of — along with an apology for readers from Haymo Ross, the journal’s editor in chief. It turns out that there … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2019/11/12/after-ten-years-of-being-in-limbo-a-chemistry-paper-is-retracted/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;After ten years of being in limbo, a chemistry paper is retracted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

The health reporter at &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/smell-dating-4/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt; wrote about the underlying science in detail (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;major histocompatibility complex&lt;/a&gt;) and interviewed smell scientists, including Dr. Noam Sobel (founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smellspace.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SmellSpace.com&lt;/a&gt;), Dr. Richard Doty (author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/great-pheromone-myth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Great Pheromone Myth&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and Dr. Gary Beauchamp (Emeritus Director of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.monell.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Monell Chemical Senses Center&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creators of Smell Dating (&lt;a href=&quot;http://tegabrain.com/Smell-Dating&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tega Brain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://lav.io/projects/smell-dating/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sam Levine&lt;/a&gt;) consulted with olfactory scientists and provided an extensive reading list on the web site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most everyone agrees that  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3794443/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;odors evoke emotion&lt;/a&gt;, and the sense of smell has a unique relationship to &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13423-018-1545-3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;autobiographical memory&lt;/a&gt;. But, as Richard Doty asks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK200980/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;do human pheromones exist?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;While it is apparent that, like music and lighting, odors and fragrances  can alter mood states and physiological arousal, is there evidence that  unique agents exist, namely pheromones, which specifically alter such  states?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that scientific opinion on this matter is decidedly mixed, even polarizing, as I'll discuss in the next post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reference&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doty RL.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You wouldn’t like me when I’m angry”: for the more mild-mannered among us, Bruce Banner’s famous catchphrase may not resonate. But add some hunger — “you wouldn’t like me when I’m &lt;em&gt;hangry”&lt;/em&gt; — and many of us can start to relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being hungry, whilst a daily occurrence, can have multiple negative psychological impacts. For one, and most obviously, it simply doesn’t feel good, often leading us to the aforementioned rattiness of “hanger”. But acute hunger has also been &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.44.3.513&quot;&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to an increase in self-interest and a decrease in helping behaviour, too. If your resources are low, the theory goes, you’re much less likely to cooperate with others as you want to keep food for yourself and are unwilling to expend valuable resources like time and energy on helping others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t always the case — at least not according to a new piece of research from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12579-7&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt; Communications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The team argues that acute hunger doesn’t always have an impact on prosociality, even though people strongly believe it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38443&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Together with their colleagues, Jan Häusser and Christina Stahlecker from Justus-Liebig-University Gießen conducted four studies to examine the phenomenon. In the first, acute hunger was experimentally manipulated, with participants instructed not to eat anything after 10pm the previous night. Those in the control condition were given food before completing tasks, whilst those in the hunger condition were not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants completed the Public Goods Game, a task which sees players deciding whether or not to contribute money to a shared pool. A prosocial response would be the contribution of everything to the shared pot to maximise resources. But those who don’t behave in a prosocial way would also profit, receiving both contributions from the shared pot and their own resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite the first group’s hunger, they didn’t significantly differ in their contributions compared to the control group. This was even true in a second study, where sessions were scheduled later to make participants even hungrier, and control participants given a higher level of sugar before completing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third and fourth studies, students were recruited in front of a cafe before and after lunch, and had levels of prosociality measured through several tasks. These included a request to participate in a future, follow-up study — for absolutely no financial compensation. And again, the team found that hunger did not predict participants’ levels of prosociality: 45% of hungry participants agreed to volunteer for this future study compared to 47% of sated participants. Another task showed that these participants were &lt;span&gt;also&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;just as willing to share money with a partner as the non-hungry participants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite these findings, our beliefs about what happens when we need food are somewhat different. In an online survey, the team found that people &lt;em&gt;expected&lt;/em&gt; hungry people to be more selfish, less helpful and less cooperative. They also believed the same of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why the disparity? The team suggests such beliefs are grounded in the “widespread myth of self-interest” — the idea that people are essentially and inherently selfish. If we ascribe to this belief, of course it makes sense that we think people would shed all prosociality when times get tough: underneath the surface, after all, we care about ourselves more than anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, as the team points out, only apply to hunger “within the upper boundaries of the natural daily fluctuation typical in Western industrialized societies” — in other words, the results may not be relevant when considering the sort of existential hunger that many experience through poverty, war or natural disasters. The cafe studies also depended on subjective measurements of hunger, making it difficult to tell exactly how hungry participants were and therefore how this may affect their behaviour and choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the idea that people are not inherently selfish — even when going through unpleasant or uncomfortable experiences — may be a valuable takeaway. And as we continue to experience political and environmental turmoil, it may be a lesson we sorely need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12579-7&quot;&gt;Acute hunger does not always undermine prosociality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

With LIQs, you get to initiate the interaction, which can greatly expedite your order by reducing lead time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For instance, you’ve been discussing the scope of work with a customer over email or phone.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/drugs-2793133-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who inject drugs face many health challenges. Aside from the highly publicized overdose epidemic, people who inject drugs are at risk for several infectious diseases due to the unsterile nature of injecting drugs. These infections range from hepatitis C and HIV to bacterial and fungal infections. Some infections are limited to the skin, like abscesses. Other more serious infections occur when bacteria or fungus penetrate deeper into the blood stream. When these infections get into the blood stream, they have the potential to infect bones, the central nervous system or the heart, among many other sites. When the heart is infected, the heart valves are the main sites that become affected. This condition we term infective endocarditis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infective endocarditis is a serious condition with a high likelihood of death or other complications. Examples of these complications include heart failure or embolism – clots that break off the valve and block blood vessels. These clots can block blood vessels in organs such as the kidneys, lungs or brain, leading to death of a part of that organ. The mainstay of treatment are antibiotics and under certain conditions some patients may need surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We estimated that people who inject drugs were 47% more likely to die than people who do not inject drugs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the recent increase in the United States and elsewhere of injection drug use and, consequently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2717121/drug-associated-infective-endocarditis-trends-what-s-all-buzz-about&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;infective endocarditis&lt;/a&gt;, a debate has unfurled in the mainstream and academic literature investigating what to do when people who inject drugs need surgery for infective endocarditis. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/29/health/drugs-opioids-addiction-heart-endocarditis.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;public debate&lt;/a&gt; echoes the concerns doctors and surgeons face on a day-to-day basis when dealing with these cases. Health care providers attempt to improve health and therefore try to do everything possible for all patients, however, the recidivism of drug use poses some unique challenges to surgical intervention, even when otherwise medically indicated in this specific set of circumstances. Some providers have chosen to defer or deny surgery even when indicated, although others have proposed strategies that include signed-contracts agreeing to abstinence, multidisciplinary-team treatment approaches, and even a “three-strike rule.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11420 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;199&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/heart-2607178-300x199.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many studies from diverse medical centers around the world have provided some evidence of the risks of death and reinfection after surgery in people who inject drugs. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/69/7/1120/5257358?searchresult=1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; summarized many of these studies in a systematic review and meta-analysis. The authors reported that people who inject drugs have a similar risk of death compared to people who do not inject drugs at 30 days after cardiac surgery for infective endocarditis. In this type of study – meta-analyses – the published results of many studies are pooled using different statistical techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our objective was to estimate the risk of death and re-operation of people who inject drugs after cardiac surgery for infective endocarditis over a longer period of time. We also performed a systematic review and meta-analysis but extended our analysis to 5 and 10 years. We estimated that people who inject drugs were 47% more likely to die than people who do not inject drugs. We also estimated that people who inject drugs were more than twice as likely to require re-operation over the studied time period. Based on these estimates, at 5 years, people who inject drugs had a 62% chance of being alive compared to a 70% chance in people who do not inject drugs. Further, the average age of people who inject drugs in the included studies was 35 years compared to 51 years in people who do no inject drugs. This is concerning as people who inject drugs were younger, and hence, are less likely to suffer from other chronic diseases, they were still more likely to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;people who inject drugs were more than twice as likely to require re-operation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot know from the included studies why people who inject drugs were more likely to die or have a re-operation. We do have a major thought as to why and how to prevent it. Traditionally, people who inject drugs rarely receive treatment for their substance use disorders at acute care hospitals. Treatments like methadone, buprenorphine or long-acting naltrexone, exist and have been proven to be effective. The hospital visit is a lost moment when treatment for substance use could be provided but was not. Without treatment for the underlying substance use disorder, people who inject drugs are likely to continue injecting drugs after being discharged from the hospital, in turn, increasing their chance of reinfection and death. The source of the infection has not been addressed. We need to offer treatment to every patient with a substance use disorder at every chance we get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we provide evidence that people who inject drugs have worse outcomes after cardiac surgery than people who do not inject drugs. Although our data cannot answer the question of whether people who inject drugs should get surgery or not, we do know that interventions are urgently needed to bridge the gap in outcomes after cardiac surgery between people who do and do not inject drugs. Every effort should be made to provide evidence-based therapy for substance use disorders to people with these disorders when engaging medical settings. With the ever-increasing number of people who inject drugs engaging with our medical centers we should be ready to provide these treatments, and further develop strategies to improve on these treatments. This would save the lives of many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting kids to sit still during brain scans is notoriously difficult — but now researchers have developed an MEG scanner that is essentially a modified bike helmet. &lt;/strong&gt;The device could make it easier to measure brain activity in young children, as well as scan older participants as they perform activities they wouldn’t be able to do in a standard MEG scanner, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2019/11/05/to-help-fidgety-kids-researchers-made-a-brain-scanner-that-fits-in-a-bike-helmet/#.XcUgWTP7SUl&quot;&gt;writes Jennifer Walter at &lt;em&gt;Discover Magazine’s&lt;/em&gt; “D-Brief” blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38421&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some women apparently lack part of the brain that is key for processing odour, yet are still able to smell&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-women-who-lack-olfactory-bulbs-can-still-sense-smell&quot;&gt;Sofie Bates reports at &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers estimate that around 4% of left-handed women are missing the brain’s olfactory bulbs, &lt;span&gt;based on MRI scans that show no sign of the structures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The fact these people can still smell suggests that other areas of the brain may be able to compensate for the absence of olfactory bulbs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Animal owners may believe that ineffective treatments work on their pets because of a phenomenon known as the “caregiver placebo effect”&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/11/danger-pet-placebo/601489/?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;writes Emily Anthes at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; After giving a sick pet &lt;span&gt;medication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, people may be more likely to interpret ambiguous symptoms in a more positive way, for instance. Unfortunately, that can result in owners believing that their pets are responding to ineffective alternative therapies, and leave them blind to the continued suffering of their pets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a 1973 study, David Rosenham and seven other healthy volunteers pretended to be patients and got themselves admitted at psychiatric hospitals in the United States.&lt;/strong&gt; The experiment revealed the poor conditions of psychiatric care and the supposed unreliability of psychiatric diagnoses, and &lt;span&gt;has&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/20/textbook-fail-rosenhans-classic-on-being-sane-in-insane-places-covered-without-criticism/&quot;&gt;become a staple of psychology textbooks.&lt;/a&gt; But&lt;span&gt; in her new book “The Great Pretender”, Susannah Cahalan is left wondering whether the study really occurred as Rosenham claimed. Cahalan &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/11/02/stanford-professor-who-changed-america-with-just-one-study-was-also-a-liar/&quot;&gt;recounts her investigation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in an article at the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, while Alison Abbott &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03268-y&quot;&gt;reviews the book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychedelic drugs are receiving increased attention for their potential to treat depression and other mental health conditions&lt;/strong&gt;. But is the experience of a “trip” necessary for the effects of these drugs — or do they influence well-being through some other means? At &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa748k/psilocybin-for-depression-and-the-world-of-non-hallucinogenic-psychedelics&quot;&gt;Shayla Love talks to the researchers&lt;/a&gt; trying to untangle the mechanisms behind the drugs’ apparent clinical effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, we recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/08/29/further-evidence-that-acting-like-an-extravert-can-boost-wellbeing/&quot;&gt;reported on a new study&lt;/a&gt; suggesting (with some caveats) that acting like an extravert can boost well-being.&lt;/strong&gt; Now, over at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, introvert Sirin Kale &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/nov/07/faking-it-could-i-go-from-being-an-introvert-to-an-extrovert-in-one-week-&quot;&gt;performs an &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 1 replication&lt;/a&gt; of the study, going out of her comfort zone to spend an extraverted week attending gardening and walking groups, a dodgeball game and a Halloween party full of strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compiled by Matthew Warren (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@MattbWarren&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), Editor of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/&quot;&gt;BPS Research Digest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Break-ups are always hard, with love and companionship giving way to feelings of resentment and the souring of once treasured memories. Yet people often continue to harbour positive feelings towards their exes long after the relationship is over. And that may be particularly the case if you’re a man, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550619876633&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers have found that, in heterosexual relationships at least, men tend to view their exes more positively than do women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38408&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ursula Athenstaedt from the University of Graz and colleagues first discovered the effect when conducting research into whether people’s attitudes towards their exes could be altered. Across two studies, a total of almost 300 heterosexual participants completed a questionnaire about their attitudes towards their former partners, rating their agreement with 18 statements like “When I think about my ex-partner I get angry” and “My ex-partner has many positive traits”. The researchers’ experimental manipulation turned out to have no effect on these ratings — but instead they found that, overall, men tended to have slightly more positive attitudes towards their exes than women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team decided to further explore the finding in a third study. They gave the same attitude questionnaire to 612 new participants, all of whom had had a previous heterosexual relationship lasting at least 4 months; some were now in a new relationship while others were single. The participants also completed several other scales, such as rating the degree of social support they had received from their ex-partner, how much they used coping strategies like self-distraction or venting following their break-up, the reasons for breaking up, and their attitudes towards sex and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men again had more positive attitudes towards their exes than women, with an average score on the questionnaire of 3.57 (out of 5) compared to the women’s average of 3.11. But men and women also differed on several of the other measures as well. Men had a more “permissive” attitude towards sex (they were more likely to agree with statements like “I do not need to be committed to a person to have sex with her”), for example, and had received more social support from their exes than had women. On the other hand, women had used more coping strategies following their break-ups, and were more likely to say that their partner was the cause of the split. A subsequent analysis showed that these various factors could partly — but not completely — account for the differences between men and women in their attitudes towards exes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that the findings may stem from a combination of evolutionary and social factors. Men’s permissive sexual attitudes might make them &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/08/the-reasons-we-stay-friends-with-an-ex/&quot;&gt;more eager to keep open the possibility of sex with former partners&lt;/a&gt;, for instance — and so it makes sense to maintain a more positive attitude towards them. Similarly, men may hold a rosier view of their exes because they were a greater source of emotional support, whereas women tended to receive less support from their partners and more from other sources like friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whether these theories hold up remains to be seen. “While our studies document this stable gender difference, we do not know its specific origins. Even though both evolutionary and gender role theories provide some valuable insights, additional research is needed to pin down the key origins,” the authors acknowledge. And it’s also unclear how far the results generalise. Most notably, the study only included heterosexual participants, so doesn’t reveal much about the attitudes of men and women who are gay or bisexual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, having a more positive view of your ex may actually have a detrimental effect on subsequent romantic partnerships, the team suggests — so men’s new relationships may be particularly prone to difficulties. In other words, being grateful for your ex may actually make it harder to say “thank you, next”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550619876633&quot;&gt;Men View Their Ex-Partners More Favorably Than Women Do&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/featured2-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it important to include participants as partners? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal population-based cohort studies that assess health-related exposure outcomes can provide important knowledge about the needs of older adults, and are &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-842X.2006.tb00849.x&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;critical to our understanding&lt;/a&gt; of the aging process. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/hex.12158&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Listening to the voice of research participants&lt;/a&gt; is not new in ageing research. It is, however, important to distinguish between older adults as the subjects of research and older adults as &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40520-017-0750-7&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;partners in the research process&lt;/a&gt;. While issues of engagement can be similar, the relationship is quite different – involving older adults in decisions about the research process is about a shift in power – it is about building partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, we know relatively little about the priorities of older adults and the possible problems they experience when they participate in longitudinal population-based studies. Therefore, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1238-4?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our study&lt;/a&gt; aimed to explore older adults’ motives, understandings and experiences regarding participating in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10654-018-0459-8&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Studies&lt;/a&gt; (the H70 study) – multidisciplinary epidemiological studies examining representative birth cohorts of older populations in Gothenburg, Sweden, since 1971.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did we perform the study? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty-eight 70-year-old participants from the H70 study participated in nine &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9566.ep11347023&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;focus groups&lt;/a&gt; to discuss what made them agree to participate in the study and their experiences of the health examinations and questions, the self-report assessments they were asked to fill out, and the information that they had received prior to, during, and after the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, it was worth it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the H70 study was experienced on the one hand as intense, exhausting, and never-ending, and on the other hand as interesting, rewarding, challenging and beneficial – both for oneself and for others. Although the participants had critical opinions about the study as a whole, the results showed that they trusted the purpose of the study and the intentions of the researchers responsible for it. Research shows that &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11406-009-9218-0&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trust&lt;/a&gt; is considered an essential prerequisite for &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1525/jer.2008.3.4.35&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;involvement in health research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s new?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11400&quot; style=&quot;width: 303px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/fig1a-293x300.png&quot; width=&quot;293&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;from Dahlin-Ivanoff et al.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the focus groups, taking part in the H70 study was motivated by a perception that it would grant the participants access to thorough and systematic health examinations that they otherwise would not have access to due to their advanced age and seemingly ageist priorities in the Swedish healthcare system. If participation in research is a way to gain access to treatment, we must be concerned about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6939-14-40&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;context in which decisions on research participation are made&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the consequences this will have for research participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants also experienced limited control over the examinations, feeling that the information that they were given was insufficient, and that the purpose of various tests was hard to understand. This resulted in participants still having unanswered questions even while participating in the study. The H70 study is a complex environment that poses major challenges for participants’ ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0951484816639741&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;understand and use health information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some questions were also considered sensitive and difficult to answer. For example, the participants perceived certain questions as ageist, stereotyping and attributing certain characteristics to older adults based on their age. Other questions were perceived as heteronormative and discriminatory against all participants with other forms of sexuality and gender roles. However, our results also showed that if the participants felt safe and confident in the meeting with the person conducting the examinations, they did not find it difficult to be open and truthful when answering sensitive questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical implications &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study has provided us with knowledge concerning a number of problems that we have to consider in future follow-up examinations in the H70 study in order to ensure the quality of longitudinal studies of older adults. By including older adults as collaborators in research, their autonomy and self-determination can increase, as well as their ability to act on their own authority. For us as researchers, listening effectively to the experience and knowledge of older adults may lead to innovative lines of research, provide insight, and ensure that the research questions addressed are those that will benefit older adults the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to succeed with increased user involvement at all stages of the research process, we need to create supportive research environments with well-trained research staff that have access to the educational tools needed in order to secure the quality of the results the H70 study. This also includes development of tools needed to meet the needs of those older adults with lower health literacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many of us, saying thank you is a simple fact of life: someone does a nice thing, you express your gratitude. A lack of thanks when you feel it is due can certainly leave you feeling irritated, but on the whole we rarely think about the practice beyond the fact that it’s both considered polite and that it feels good to thank or be thanked. Indeed, much &lt;a href=&quot;https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/pdfs/GratitudePDFs/2Wood-GratitudeWell-BeingReview.pdf&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that expressing gratitude can lead to increased well-being and positive affect, including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-08033-003&quot;&gt;rise in happiness&lt;/a&gt;, and increased ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735810000413?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;recognise and adapt to various situational demands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But could giving thanks actually reinforce unequal power dynamics? The authors of a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167219879125&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin &lt;/em&gt;think so. They argue that expressing gratitude towards higher power groups can result in low-power groups ending up “pacified” and discouraged from advocating for their own interests, making saying “thank you” more problematic than we may have first assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-38395&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inna Ksenofontov and Julia Becker from the University of Osnabrück designed several studies to test this hypothesis. In the first, participants were assigned to a low-power position as an “employee”. They were then asked to collaborate with another employee and a manager through computerised tasks, the completion of which would enter them into a prize draw. But the manager behaved unfairly, assigning himself easy tasks and giving employees those that were difficult or impossible to complete — meaning he kept the lottery tickets for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the first set, the manager contacted the participants and offered to give them easier tasks in the next round. Participants in the experimental condition were given three response options, all expressing thanks (e.g. “thank you very much”); control participants were given neutral options (e.g. “I have read the message”). Participants then indicated how willing they would be to protest against the manager’s actions on the employees’ behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who had to express thanks were less likely to confront their manager than those given neutral options, suggesting that the act of saying thank you had, in effect, pacified them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These participants were either forced to give, or not give, thanks — but what about when they had a clear choice to say thank you? In the second study, &lt;em&gt;voluntary &lt;/em&gt;expressions of thanks to high-power groups were measured, again to test whether they were negatively associated with intention to protest. In an online study, 125 participants were asked to imagine themselves interacting with a professor who had transgressed (by advising them to make changes to an assignment, but then grading them lower than expected) but then helped (by eventually giving them a higher score). They were then asked whether they would thank the professor or simply leave the classroom, and whether they would forgive the professor or admonish him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that 33.6% of participants said they would thank the professor, and again an analysis showed those who thanked him were less likely to complain about the professor’s behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the final studies, conducted online and in the lab, scenarios were created in which female participants had to decide whether or not to thank a high-power colleague who behaved in a sexist way, and indicate how likely they were to complain about this behaviour. Again, researchers found that expressing thanks motivated forgiveness, which in turn undermined intent to protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means, the team argues, is that expressing thanks can have a pacifying effect in situations defined by social injustice or inequality: by saying thank you, members of the lower-power group essentially “forgive” the high-power person and end up less willing to protest. This can be particularly striking in issues of human rights — the authors use the example of immigrants resisting demands to be “grateful” for citizenship, believing that doing so puts them at the mercy of higher power groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research does have some limitations — the researchers didn’t look at what happens when low-power groups &lt;em&gt;receive&lt;/em&gt; gratitude from high-power groups, nor did they analyse exactly &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; a person might thank someone in a position of power. As the team acknowledges, disadvantaged groups may use expressions of gratitude in attempts to advance their own status within a power hierarchy, so saying “thanks” may not always reflect a passive acceptance of the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this study does make clear is that even those social interactions we take for granted can have different meanings and implications in different contexts. None of this is to say that we should stop saying thank you to each other — after all, it’s an important social tool. But thinking a little more carefully about what it means, particularly for disadvantaged groups, could prove to be more useful than you might first assume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167219879125&quot;&gt;The Harmful Side of Thanks: Thankful Responses to High-Power Group Help Undermine Low-Power Groups’ Protest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/teach-1968076-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Doctora, no soy bruta”&lt;/strong&gt; a patient confided in me. This means &lt;strong&gt;“Doctor, I’m not dumb”&lt;/strong&gt; She went on to describe how she feels the sting of discrimination for not speaking English and how she dedicates her time trying to navigate her way through life, even just to find a doctor, like myself, who can speak in her own language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language skills specific to the patient-doctor encounter are critical for those who engage in clinical medicine around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we, the authors, were superheroes and could choose to have any power, we would choose omnilingualism – the ability to communicate seamlessly across languages and cultural contexts. The United States, like many other countries, is becoming increasingly diverse with immigrants from all over the world finding a new home here. As physicians, we meet patients from all walks of life who speak different languages. Listening to their journeys is one of the most inspirational parts of our work and communicating directly with linguistically diverse patients is important for building rapport and cultivating trust in the patient-doctor relationship and the broader health system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-019-1807-4&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Debate&lt;/a&gt;, published this month in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BMC Medical Education&lt;/a&gt;, we argue for medical schools to increase opportunities for medical language courses and integrate them into the curriculum with evidence-based teaching strategies, content about health equity, and standardized language assessments. Language skills specific to the patient-doctor encounter are critical for physicians who practice in the United States and for those who engage in clinical medicine around the world. Given the unprecedented interest in global health work among medical students, it is time to professionalize language preparedness as part of global health education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;To achieve our mission, we are actively working to integrate cultural humility and health equity into our curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many other medical schools, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hms.harvard.edu/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt; (HMS) offers non-English language training as part of the undergraduate medical curriculum. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://meded.hms.harvard.edu/medical-languages&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Medical Language Program&lt;/a&gt; includes elective language courses in beginner, intermediate, and advanced Spanish, Portuguese, and Mandarin. We also offer opportunities for students to do electives in other countries to solidify their language skills in addition to their clinical skills. The first medical Spanish course was started in the 1970s, and there are over 1000 alumni who have taken a language elective at HMS since then. Our mission is to promote awareness of and skills to address language barriers to achieving health equity by equipping medical students with language skills to provide language-concordant and culturally-humble care for diverse patient populations. To achieve our mission, we are actively working to integrate cultural humility and health equity into our curriculum. In addition, we are working toward standardizing assessments of language competency suitable for clinical encounters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope our Debate sparks discussions among leaders in medical schools about the importance of language instruction as part of undergraduate medical education.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Muhammad Yaqoob will talk about the paper &quot;Towards Explainable Artificial Intelligence&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, machine learning (ML) has become a key enabling
technology for the sciences and industry. Especially through
improvements in methodology, the availability of large databases
and increased computational power, today's ML algorithms are able
to achieve excellent performance (at times even exceeding the
human level) on an increasing number of complex tasks. Deep
learning models are at the forefront of this development. However,
due to their nested non-linear structure, these powerful models
have been generally considered &quot;black boxes&quot;,  not providing
any information about what exactly makes them arrive at their
predictions. Since in many applications, e.g., in the medical
domain, such lack of transparency may be not acceptable, the
development of methods for visualizing, explaining and
interpreting deep learning models has recently attracted
increasing attention. This introductory paper presents recent
developments and applications in this field and makes a plea
for a wider use of explainable learning algorithms in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

Could the same community feedback also help improve the quality and speed of the review process at a journal? We’re launching a pilot to find out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Preprints are a valuable collaborative tool. They allow researchers to share their work earlier and more broadly, opening opportunities for the community to provide constructive comments before the work is formally published in a journal. However, the vast majority of preprint feedback is delivered in private communications to the authors, and this input is therefore happening independently from the journal peer review process. We want to change that by encouraging public community comments on preprints and exploring how they can complement formal peer review to help authors and editors develop articles more efficiently. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As part of our&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/05/power-to-the-preprint/&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;longstanding partnership&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), authors can opt-in to having PLOS post a preprint version of their manuscript to bioRxiv when they submit (nearly 4,000 preprints have been posted using this service!) Now, we’ve worked with CSHL to be alerted to the comments on those preprints posted by PLOS while they are under consideration at our journals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Starting today, PLOS staff will be checking comments left on preprinted submissions to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/&quot;&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/&quot;&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ntds/&quot;&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/pathogens/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; using the PLOS preprint posting service. Those comments that could be relevant to the scientific evaluation of the manuscript will be made available to the editor handling the peer review of the manuscript at PLOS. At the discretion of the handling editor, useful comments can then complement the peer reviews that they have commissioned. As they are communicated to authors by the editor, these comments can then become part of the published peer review history for the article upon publication—making the entire review process completely transparent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We hope this trial will provide greater opportunities for research communities to participate in reviews of preprints, while promoting transparency in peer review in general. We will be checking in with authors and editors to learn more about their experiences during this pilot, and look forward to sharing the results with you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of us crumble in the face of adversity, and struggle to recover, others quickly bounce back from even serious trauma. Psychological resilience is undeniably important in all kinds of areas of life, so understanding what underpins it, and how to train it – particularly in children — is of intense interest to psychologists.&lt;span id=&quot;more-38384&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Watch your language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Carol Dweck of growth mindset fame, to drive success in our children we should “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/12/how-praise-became-a-consolation-prize/510845/&quot;&gt;praise the effort that led to the outcome or learning progress; tie the praise to it&lt;/a&gt;,” as opposed to praising effort more broadly, or achievement alone. Research led by Victoria Sisk and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797617739704&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt; did challenge the idea that encouraging children to have a growth mindset (to believe that effort affects attributes like intelligence) increases academic achievement. However, there are certainly studies finding that focusing on a child’s actions, rather than who they “are”, helps them to withstand setbacks. As Emily Foster-Hanson and her fellow researchers at New York University note in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.13147&quot;&gt;study also published last year&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;em&gt;Child Development&lt;/em&gt;: “Setbacks and difficulties are common features of children’s experience throughout development and into adulthood,” so it’s important to examine the effects of category labelling — like “being smart” or “being a helper”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team’s study of four- and five-year-old visitors to the Children’s Museum of Manhattan found that setbacks were more detrimental to a child labelled “a helper” than a child asked “to help”. Children asked “to help” with tasks in which they were set up to fail (by being asked to put away a toy truck that fell apart as soon as they picked it up, for example) were more likely to go on to volunteer to help with other demanding situations. In contrast, the “helper” kids tended to avoid these and opt instead for low-effort tasks with a high chance of success, like putting away some crayons. Perhaps these kids were taking advantage of a quick, virtually-guaranteed way to restore a little of their dented “helper” image — one they weren’t about to risk even further by going for a challenging task. So, if you do want your kids to weather inevitable setbacks, resist asking them to “be” anything, like “my helper”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Engage in “strength-based parenting”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Strength-based parenting” entails deliberately identifying and cultivating positive states, processes and qualities in a child, explains Lea Waters at the University of Melbourne, Australia. “This style of parenting adds a ‘positive filter’ to the way a child reacts to stress. It also limits the likelihood of children using avoidance or aggressive coping responses,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Waters and her colleagues published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scirp.org/html/4-6901461_56129.htm&quot;&gt;preliminary study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Psychology&lt;/em&gt; that explored strength-based coping in a group of Australian primary school-age children. The team presented the kids with a few theoretical stressful scenarios — falling out with a friend over turns on a swing, and being the only one in class who hadn’t done a homework project that was due in the next day — and asked them to describe how they would respond. The children who came up with “positive” responses (like taking deep breaths to help them to cope with the homework challenge, and reminding themselves of happy times with the friend, or “using their kindness” and deciding to let the other child have more turns on the swing), and who indicated that their parents were aware of their strengths, and encouraged them to use them, also experienced less stress themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Waters and her team reported that &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41042-017-0007-x&quot;&gt;training in strength-based parenting could help parents, too&lt;/a&gt;. Parents who were taught how to identify and cultivate strengths in themselves and their children went on to feel more positively about their children and reported greater confidence in their ability to raise them successfully. Then in 2019, the team reported a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-018-9983-1&quot;&gt;link between strength-based coping and enhanced academic perseverance&lt;/a&gt; in adolescents. This work suggests that a “strength-based” approach may help with resilience to setbacks at school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try a strength-based approach with a child, the team recommends consciously identifying and fostering their abilities, talents and skills, and encouraging them to use them when faced with difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Don’t shield them from stress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennis Charney, a biological psychiatrist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai, New York, has studied all kinds of people who’ve been through traumatic experiences — from being a prisoner of war to suffering assault, or natural disaster — and identified factors that explain why some people bounce back, while others don’t. (His 2012 book, &lt;em&gt;Resilience&lt;/em&gt;, jointly-authored with Steven Southwick at Yale University, explains the findings in full. There’s also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://icahn.mssm.edu/about/leadership/resilience&quot;&gt;podcast based on the book&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being the kind of person who embraces tough challenges, rather than trying to avoid them, emerged as a key factor. To develop this, Charney recommends giving kids challenges that they can just about manage, and once they have achieved them, raising the bar a little each time. With his own five kids, he’d take them on long hikes, for instance, and get them just a little lost. During one of these trips, he recalls, one of his daughters told him that “out of her soul, she despised me”. (Now an adult, she willingly goes off hiking herself). Exposing kids to controlled stressful experiences allows them to develop a “psychological toolkit” of coping methods to draw upon in adulthood too, Charney maintains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Teach self-regulation skills &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explicitly teaching kids ways to regulate their responses to adversity builds resilience, helping them to do well in school and in life. This is the message from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00612/full&quot;&gt;a 2017 study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, of 365 Spanish children and young adults, aged 15-21, all of whom struggled academically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In research conducted for her &lt;a href=&quot;http://dadun.unav.edu/bitstream/10171/36188/4/TesisRaquelArtuch.pdf&quot;&gt;2014 PhD thesis&lt;/a&gt;, Raquel Artuch-Garde at the International University of La Rioja found that self-regulation and resilience are key factors that can determine academic success or failure. For the more recent study, she and her colleagues gave the participants a resilience scale (which asked about their perceptions of support and their ability to tolerate negative situations) and a self-regulation questionnaire (which explored their ability to make and stick to goals and to persevere at a task). They found a clear relationship between scores on both. Participants who were better able to learn from mistakes — which was considered to be a crucial aspect of self-regulation — had a greater tolerance for negative situations; in other words, they demonstrated greater resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-regulation involves analysing and setting specific task-related goals, monitoring and evaluating your performance, managing your emotions throughout, and learning from whatever went wrong. The recent study suggests that teaching children these kinds of skills could help with resilience, too. “The research shows the relationship between two essential non-cognitive skills: resilience and self-regulation, that are equally or even more important than cognitive aspects in the educational process of students at risk of social exclusion,” Artuch-Garde says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Focus on “quantity time” and group activities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998, Iceland launched a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rannsoknir.is/en/ipm/&quot;&gt;national initiative&lt;/a&gt; with the aim of slashing alcohol and drug use among teens. But the way the programme was set up meant that &lt;a href=&quot;https://mosaicscience.com/story/iceland-prevent-teen-substance-abuse/&quot;&gt;it did not only this, but much more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through funded sport, art and music classes, teenagers were given alternative ways to feel good. Among new measures targeted at adults, parents were encouraged to spend more time with their kids (not just limited “quality time”) and to talk more to their children about their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National questionnaires showed a huge adoption of both these strategies between 1997 and 2012 — and during the same period, Iceland went from having some of the worst statistics for teen alcohol and drug use in Europe to having the best. “This is the most remarkably intense and profound study of stress in the lives of teenagers that I have ever seen,” commented US-based consultant Harvey Milkman, in 2017. “I’m just so impressed by how well it is working.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towns and municipalities in many other countries &lt;a href=&quot;https://planetyouth.org/&quot;&gt;have now adopted the model&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2019, Chile announced that it would roll out its own version of the Icelandic programme nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Icelandic initiative was not set up to “train resilience”, but in bringing families closer together and increasing access to sport and cultural activities, it is producing physically and psychologically healthier teenagers — kids who find it easier to resist drugs, and who should be better equipped to cope with challenges in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It couldn’t have happened, however, without the full backing of the government, local mayors, other public officials and schools. In other communities that are adopting the model, and that are seeing the benefits, local mayors and policy-makers have either instigated or come on board to drive similar programmes within their community. An individualistic focus on improving self-regulation, for example, in your own kids is one thing. But when everyone gets together to support all the teens within a community, or a country, the results can be remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;NeuroFedora logo&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://neuroblog.fedoraproject.org/images/NeuroFedoraLogo01.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 30%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/design/issue/602&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora logo by Terezahl from the Fedora Design Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have been busy working on our first deliverable so this post is a little
overdue. Since we now have quite a bit of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/compneuro-tools/&quot;&gt;software for computational
neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;
available to use in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt;, the obvious next step was to try and make
this even more easily available to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-31/&quot;&gt;Fedora 31&lt;/a&gt; based Comp Neuro ISO image is now ready, you can get it &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/install-media/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For more
information on what this contains, and how it is created, read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;fedora-community-deliverables&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fedora Community deliverables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fedora community generates a bunch of deliverables for users. The main
ones, of course, are the primary editions: the workstation, the server edition,
CoreOS, Silverblue, IoT. They can all be obtained from the community website at
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://getfedora.org&quot;&gt;https://getfedora.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these are ready to use and have gone through a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/31/Schedule&quot;&gt;thorough development
cycle&lt;/a&gt; that includes a
stringent &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA&quot;&gt;Quality Assurance (QA)&lt;/a&gt; cycle.
These are &quot;live&quot;, so they can either either be used directly off the ISO image
without having to install them, or they can be used to install a Fedora based
system. Them being &quot;live&quot; makes them a great tool for temporary work---grab an
ISO, start up a virtual machine, use Fedora to do your work, destroy the
virtual machine when done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these are the main deliverables, the Fedora community also generates
other media for our diverse user base. These are classified as &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://spins.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;Spins&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://labs.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;Labs&lt;/a&gt;. While the Workstation is based on the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gnome.org&quot;&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt; desktop environment, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://spins.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;Spins&lt;/a&gt;
provide Fedora users other desktop environment based images: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://kde.org/&quot;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://lxqt.org/&quot;&gt;LXQT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://xfce.org/&quot;&gt;XFCE&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://mate-desktop.org&quot;&gt;Mate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_(desktop_environment)&quot;&gt;Cinnamon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sugarlabs.org/&quot;&gt;Sugar on a stick (SAOS)&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://labs.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;Labs&lt;/a&gt; are similar, but instead of focussing on the desktop environment, they
include customised sets of software required for particular purposes:
Astronomy, Design, Python, Security, Robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;the-fedora-community-change-process&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Fedora Community Change Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We therefore, submitted a community change proposal to permit us to generate
another Fedora Lab image, one for computational neuroscience. You can read the
proposal &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Comp_Neuro_Lab&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/program_management/changes_policy/&quot;&gt;Changes process&lt;/a&gt;
allows community members to propose new changes to aid the community. Depending
on their scope, they can either be &quot;System wide&quot; or &quot;Self Contained&quot; changes.
The &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/Z4NKZUX3SJXOC6QAC72AOEYECSS4JSKT/&quot;&gt;community discussed our proposal&lt;/a&gt;,
and the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/&quot;&gt;FESCO&lt;/a&gt;) has &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/2237&quot;&gt;approved it&lt;/a&gt; as a change for the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/32/Schedule&quot;&gt;Fedora 32&lt;/a&gt; release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, from &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/32/Schedule&quot;&gt;Fedora 32&lt;/a&gt; onwards, a Comp Neuro Lab image will be generated by the
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.pagure.org/releng/&quot;&gt;Fedora Release Engineering Team&lt;/a&gt; as an
official Fedora community deliverable, and it will feature on the Fedora &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://labs.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;Labs&lt;/a&gt;
website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;fedora-31-comp-neuro-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fedora 31 Comp Neuro Image&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/32/Schedule&quot;&gt;Fedora 32&lt;/a&gt;, however, is still in the works. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-31/&quot;&gt;Fedora 31&lt;/a&gt; was only released
recently. Therefore, in the meantime, as a Beta test, the NeuroFedora team is
generating an ISO based on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-31/&quot;&gt;Fedora 31&lt;/a&gt; ourselves.  You can get it &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/install-media/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is based on the Fedora Workstation, which is an excellent &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://gnome.org&quot;&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt; based
operating system for users. To the Fedora Workstation, we added a variety of
simulators and analysis tools that are used in computational neuroscience, such
as: auryn, bionetgen, calcium-calculator, COPASI, qalculate, getdp,
genesis-simulator, gnuplot, moose, nest, neuron, neurord, octave, paraview,
python3, brian2, ipython, nest, neuron, libNeuroML, neo, nineml, PyLEMS, and
smoldyn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also includes the complete Python Science stack: matplotlib, jupyter
notebook, numpy, pandas, pillow, scikit-image, scikit-learn, scipy,
statsmodels, and sympy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use these tools, please give it a go and see what you think. You can
contact us using one of our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/communicating/&quot;&gt;communication channels&lt;/a&gt; (also
linked in the top bar of this site). If you use a tool that is not included in
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; yet, you can also suggest it for inclusion using &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://goo.gl/forms/j6AJ82yOh78MPxby1&quot;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is volunteer driven initiative and contributions in any form always
welcome.  You can get in touch with us &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/overview/#_communicating_and_getting_help&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
We are happy to help you learn the skills needed to contribute to the project.
In fact, that is one of the major goals of the initiative---to spread technical
knowledge that is necessary to develop software for Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/how-to-nurture-a-healthy-brain-for-life-part-7-of-your-brain-at-100/"/>
		<id>http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/?p=6073</id>
		<updated>2019-11-05T05:11:13+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-6075&quot; height=&quot;491&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/woman-standing-near-yellow-petaled-flower-2050994.jpg&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part 7 of a series of lessons in brain health from our elders — those folk who lived the longest and healthiest. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theneuroscienceacademy.mykajabi.com/100-year-old-brain-pdf&quot;&gt;Click here to download the entire series as a PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dementia, memory loss and cognitive decline are robustly related to old age, and AD is one of the leading causes of death globally. So, is the payoff for a longer life memory loss and poor brain health in our final years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, I’ve look to two sources — those exceptionally old folks who remain in robust physical and mental health until the very end of their lives, and our evolutionary past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over millennia, Mother Nature has equipped us to survive and thrive in the wild. Our brains evolved such that from the womb to the tomb we’re required to move, eat well, sleep, immerse ourselves in nature, avoid stress, love and befriend, and seek meaning. These requirements neatly match the everyday life prescriptions followed by the world’s longest-living people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevention is our best defence and the research on dementia is clear. Those of us who lead mentally, socially and physically stimulating lives have reduced risk of age-related brain disease. If we live as close as possible to how Mother Nature intended, while reaping the rewards of our modern healthcare, there is every chance we can add not only years to our lives but life to our years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our human ancestors likely evolved facing similar survival challenges to other species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas the need to acquire food was a major day-to-day challenge during much of our evolutionary history, today we live with a constant oversupply of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, our intellectual challenges focus on work or education, rather than the challenge of acquiring food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientist and ageing researcher, Prof Mark P. Mattson writers in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/25576651/&quot;&gt;Ageing Brain Reviews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular intellectual challenges are critical for brain development and a successful career, and recent findings suggest that intermittent exercise and energy restriction can further enhance and then sustain the functional capabilities of the brain during aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather like an animal in the wild, our intellect evolved to function optimally when we’re motivated towards a goal, slightly hungry, and on foot, a state Mattson likens to &lt;em&gt;‘Hunger Games’ bolstered brainpower. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30089-9&quot;&gt;2017 Trends in Neurosciences&lt;/a&gt; paper, University of Arizona researchers David Raichlen and Gene Alexander support Mattson’s case that our brains are a product of our evolutionary history and our past as hunter-gatherers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They argue as humans transitioned from a relatively sedentary ape-like existence to a more physically demanding hunter-gatherer lifestyle, starting around two million years ago, we began to engage in complex foraging tasks that were simultaneously physically and mentally demanding, and that may explain how moving and thinking came to be so connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the parts of the brain most taxed during high cognitive load tasks such as foraging (the pre-frontal cortex, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex) are the same areas that show vulnerability in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When faced with inactivity as is so common in our modern-day life, our brains adaptively reduce capacity as part of an energy-saving strategy, leading to age-related brain atrophy…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence from modern science and ancient wisdom is clear. How we eat, move, sleep, form relationships and find meaning is intimately connected to how our brains grow, think, feel and, ultimately, age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. The best exercise for your brain is physical exercise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brains and nervous systems evolved to move us around and to sense and perceive the world. Our cognitive prowess and human intellect evolved while we were on foot. Our brains evolved, not to think or feel, but to control how we move. Therefore, moving is the best way we know to keep our brains fit and well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininstitute.ca/docs/final_report_obi_pa_alzheimers_february_25_2013.pdf&quot;&gt;Canadian review&lt;/a&gt; of twenty-four randomised control trials and twenty-one prospective cohort studies calculated that at least one in seven cases of AD could be prevented if everyone who is currently inactive took up exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People living in Blue Zones people don’t run marathons, wear Fitbits, or join Crossfit gyms. Instead, they live in environments that constantly ‘nudge’ them into moving without thinking about it. Jeanne Calment rode her bike till she was 100, and lived in a second-story apartment with no lift until she was 110.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Eat real food, not too much, mostly plants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ancestors and their smart brains were trotting across the landscape hunting, fishing and foraging for food. We evolved to eat food from the rivers, forest and sky. We are also adaptable, and the many versions of a healthy ‘diet’ vary by country, culture (and today by social media platform). What sets those who live the longest apart is not the minutiae of their diet and balance of nutrients gained from fats, protein or carbohydrates, but the absence of refined processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence from epidemiological studies such as the Blue Zones and clinical trials strongly implicates a Mediterranean-style diet slows brain ageing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And most recently, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://foodandmoodcentre.com.au/smiles-trial/&quot;&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; in Australia proved successful in treating depression by encouraging young people with depression to up their consumption of vegetables, fruits, wholegrains, legumes, fish, lean red meats, olive oil and nuts, while reducing their consumption of unhealthy ‘extras’ foods, such as sweets, refined cereals, fried food, fast-food, processed meats and sugary drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we eat, we’re consuming not only nutrients but energy in the form of calories. Researchers, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dunedinstudy.otago.ac.nz/&quot;&gt;Dunedin Study team&lt;/a&gt;, are now unravelling the relationships among calories, lifespan, healthspan and cognitive health. Calorie restriction (eating less) and intermittent fasting (fasting on and off) increases longevity in all species thus far observed, from yeast to rodents to primates — it’s assumed the same is true for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This notion ties back to the ‘Hunger Games’ concept whereby our brains evolved to function most optimally when we’re hungry and looking for food. Eating less benefits our glucose control, cholesterol and may produce mild neuronal stress which engages signalling pathways that improve the ability of the brain to resist ageing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dietary advice for brain health can be summed up by Michael Pollen’s famous adage,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat real food, not too much, mostly plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Get more sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As earthlings, our biological rhythms are determined by the rising and setting of the sun. Our sleep patterns, when hormones are released, our blood pressure and body temperature, ebb and flow in sync with day and night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern-day life with its artificial lighting late at night, alarm clocks, shift work, iPhones in bed, and jetlag, is very good at interfering with our natural sleep patterns. As a basic biological function, sleep is overlooked and underappreciated, and globally, modern humans are chronically sleep-deprived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep deprivation (even a few hours a night) impacts cognition, mood, memory, and learning, and long-term leads to chronic disease including depression, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, all risk factors for developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good night’s sleep every night should be a priority, not a luxury. And my personal daily indulgence, a short afternoon nap, consolidates memory, sparks creativity and smooths your rough emotional edges, giving you greater control over your thoughts and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Challenge your mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lab mice kept in bare cages with no toys or places to explore show greater rates of age-related cognitive decline compared to their counterparts kept in enriched novel environments full of toys, tunnels and mazes. As we’ve discussed, humans are no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who stay mentally engaged in life and constantly challenge themselves to step out of their comfort zone have reduced risk of age-related cognitive decline and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children have a natural tendency to run and play, whereas adults tend take life more seriously. We don’t lose the need for novelty and pleasure once we grow up. Game playing, whether it be video or online, traditional board games, dancing, or team or individual sports, has been shown to alleviate boredom, anxiety, depression, loneliness, despair and even physical pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/add-life-years-uncovering-secrets-successful-ageing-dr-charlen-levitan/&quot;&gt;Charlene Levitan&lt;/a&gt; said to me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t stop playing and learning because we get old, we grow old because we stop playing and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Find your place or moment of calm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One pervasive theme I came across writing my &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/book/&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; was how stress ‘gets under our skin’ to influence our mental and physical health decades later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all stress is bad, but chronic or toxic stress, especially life events that are out of our control, have deleterious effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to buffering stress is to find ways to improve your perceived ability to cope with whatever life throws your way. Find peace amid the chaos. Find your place or moment of calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence is mixed whether or not stress causes dementia, but it’s clear stress hormones alter risk for anxiety, depression, obesity and cardiovascular disease, which in turn increase dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More has been spoken or written about the practice of mindfulness meditation in recent years than any other previously free stress-relief practice. With good reason. Paying attention to your breath, which is a core component of many mindfulness practices, reduced anxiety and depression, and improves sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue Zones people have in place varied daily rituals that reduce or buffer the impact of stress in their lives. Activities include prayer, napping and happy hour with friends. (I’ll add walking the dog or enjoying a good book to the mix.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Connect with family and friends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we foraged, caught or hunted our food, we trotted back to our tribe. Being socially connected to other people protects against stress and because socialising involves many cognitive functions such as thinking, feeling, sensing, reasoning and intuition, friendships contribute to cognitive reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old age brings ‘costs of survivorship,’ and a ‘thinned’ social landscape. Richard Setterson &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15427609.2015.1071944&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We lose people with whom we shared many experiences, who are central to our identities, and who are no longer there to validate — or to question — our memories or accounts. This kind of identity loss also occurs with the death of older generations, as we are pushed up the family ladder and, once at the top, become orphans in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2010 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/20668659/&quot;&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 148 studies including 300 000 people who were tracked for 7.5 years after completing surveys of how often they met with family and friends, found socially connected folks live longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flipside, loneliness was associated with late-life loss of cognition, including elevated blood pressure, depression and poor sleep. The startling conclusion of this report was that the influence of social isolation on the health and risk of death was comparable to smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Seek out meaning and purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With purpose and meaning comes positive emotions — love, compassion, and appreciation — which counteract stress and support a healthy brain throughout life. Blue Zones residents are members of faith communities and find meaning and purpose through spirituality. Living a meaningful life seems an unlikely addition to a book about the brain, but ‘purpose in life’ is a concept in neuroscience that links to robust brain and mind health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purpose, defined as the tendency to derive meaning from life’s experiences and to possess a sense of intentionality and goal-directedness that guides behaviour, can be quantified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study published in Archives of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897172/&quot;&gt;General Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; in 2010 examined the association of purpose in life with risk of AD in more than 900 elderly people living in residential care. During the seven years of follow-up, greater purpose in life was associated with a substantially reduced risk of AD, such that a person with a high score on the purpose in life measure was approximately two and half times more likely to remain free of AD than a person with a low score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you figured out why you’re here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s your north star? Your ‘ikigai’. Your ‘plan de vida’? There are possibly many clever strategies to find meaning of your life — somewhere in the nexus of passion, skillset, employment opportunity, education and service to others. William James the psychologist said in 1920,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve come across a simpler way. Over the years, I’ve taken taken stage with Paul Baldock, a bone biologist at Sydney’s Garvan Institute of Medical Research. We called on to share our wisdom, purpose and what we’ve learned on our career paths in science. Baldock has developed a novel formula for every decision he makes in the research lab, career, and life. He simply asks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it awesome? Does it help?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
