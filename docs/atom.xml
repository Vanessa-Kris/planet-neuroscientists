		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/pexels-photo-696219-140x110.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is the fifth leading cause of death and disability globally. Increased availability of low/er strength alcohols has the potential to reduce alcohol consumption if they are consumed as substitutes for – rather than in addition to – higher strength products. For consumers to treat these products as substitutes, the marketing messages used will likely play an important role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our study published today in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we report an analysis of marketing messages on producers’ and retailers’ websites for low/er and regular strength wines and beers sold online by the four main supermarkets in the UK (Tesco, ASDA, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We compared messages marketing low/er strength wines and beers across 86 web pages with messages marketing comparable regular strength wines and beers across another 86 web pages. Low strength alcohol products were defined as containing less than 1.2% alcohol and lower strength alcohol products as containing less than 8.5% for wine and 2.8% for beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low/er strength beer was described as suitable for consumption on additional occasions to regular strength products including sports events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified four main themes in the marketing messages: occasions, health-related, alcohol content and taste. Of these themes, the different occasion, health-related and alcohol content messages were more often present for the low/er strength alcohol products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low/er strength wines were more likely to be marketed as suitable for consumption on any occasion or every day, for example as “lunchtime treats” or “perfect for all occasions”. Low/er strength beer was described as suitable for consumption on additional occasions to regular strength products including sports events such as “to refresh thirsty sportsmen and women”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing for low/er strength wines and beers was also more likely to include text or images associated with health, and information about calorie and carbohydrate content. We didn’t find any messages about drinking less or alcohol associated harms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the pattern of these findings suggests that low/er strength alcohol products may not contribute to a public health strategy to reduce alcohol consumption and related harms. These findings also add to an existing literature that highlights how measures intended to benefit public health – in this case wider availability of low/er strength alcohols – may benefit industry to the detriment of the health of the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we only looked at low/er strength wines and beers found on the websites of the four main supermarkets in the UK (and the respective producers’ webpages) future studies could extend the present findings by including other marketing platforms, and in different countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/02/08/how-are-low-er-strength-wines-and-beers-marketed-online/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How are low/er strength wines and beers marketed online?&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;BMC Series blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The desire to catch people in a lie has led to the development of techniques that are meant to detect the physical markers of dishonesty – from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraph&quot;&gt;polygraph&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2009/10/15/the-latest-verdict-on-using-brain-imaging-for-lie-detection/&quot;&gt;brain scans&lt;/a&gt;. However, these methods are often &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apa.org/research/action/polygraph.aspx&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/02/21/how-to-cheat-a-brain-scan-based-lie-detector/&quot;&gt;wanting&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721410391245&quot;&gt;insights of cognitive psychologists&lt;/a&gt; have arguably fared better, based on the idea that lying is more mentally demanding than telling the truth – real knowledge is automatically called to mind when we are questioned, and this needs to be inhibited  before we answer, leading to slower responses. Unfortunately &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-23351-001&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied&lt;/i&gt; seems to pour cold water on the idea of using these subtle reaction-time differences to develop objective (and cheap) measures to get at the truth. The findings suggest that all it takes to render this cognitive approach ineffective is a prepared false alibi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33222&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Würzburg team led by Anna Foerster set up a quasi-realistic situation, sending each of their 36 participants into a room – containing various items like a computer, pen and paper and USB stick – to read instructions in a sealed envelope that sent them on a mission. The mission involved drawing shapes on a piece of paper, tearing it and hiding the pieces in different parts of the room. Once they’d finished, the participants discovered they were going to be questioned about their actions, and that they must keep the mission secret by giving a false account of what they’d done. Their alibi was that they’d used the USB stick to email a file out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After familiarising themselves with their alibi, the participants went to another room where they answered questions on computer about the mission, mixed in with “routine” questions with predictable answers (e.g. Did you cross the street today? Did you win the lottery?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants’ task was to use Yes/No responses to answer the routine questions honestly, while responding to the mission questions according to their false alibi. At other times (denoted with an onscreen cue), they had to do the reverse, lying in response to the true routine questions while giving a true account of their mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants answered more slowly and less accurately when lying in response to the routine questions than when telling the truth. In other words, it was easier to tell the truth than deny it, consistent with the research literature on the cognitive demands of lying. However, for the mission questions, the opposite was true. The participants’ response times and accuracy suggested they found it easier to answer in line with their false alibi, than tell the truth about what they’d actually done on the mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next experiment looked at another cognitive sign of lying based on pointing movements. The mission and alibi were the same as before, but this time the participants answered questions on an iPad, tracing their finger towards onscreen Yes or No options which popped up randomly at different sides of the screen. Normally when people lie in this kind of situation, they hesitate before starting their response, they move more slowly, and instead of making a beeline for the lie response, their finger’s trajectory is indirect, curving towards the honest response. All these effects were seen in the current experiment when participants denied the truth of routine questions. But for the mission questions, the reverse was the case: it was the confessional true responses that were slower and curvier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of competing theories for what’s behind these findings. An alibi might weaken the presence of the true information, or become such a strong mental model that now it’s the first point of call. But regardless, the new results don’t look good for what was considered a solid lie detection application – and existing attempts to apply this cognitive approach to real-life court cases (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.europsy-journal.com/article/S0924-9338(07)01370-3/fulltext&quot;&gt;this investigation in 2008&lt;/a&gt; that studied the speed of a woman’s answers alongside brain scan evidence) may need to be looked at with renewed skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-23351-001&quot;&gt;Lying upside-down: Alibis reverse cognitive burdens of dishonesty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/bhsr-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migration has become an important topic of social and political debates, including in Europe. But the migrants’ perspective has seldom been considered in these debates. For instance, are migrants satisfied with their new living environment and are they given the opportunity to integrate in the hosting community? Can they access essential public services, such as education and healthcare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to give a clear-cut answer to such questions because migrants are not a homogenous group but individuals with diverse backgrounds, preferences and needs. The migrants’ legal status matters as well. Undocumented migrants without a permit authorizing them to reside in the host country, represent an especially vulnerable group. This includes individuals who have been unsuccessful in asylum procedures (rejected asylum-seekers), have overstayed the period specified in their visas (‘over-stayers’), or have entered the country illegally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-2838-y&quot;&gt;A recent review&lt;/a&gt; on healthcare utilization by undocumented migrants, which I carried out with Marjolein Winters and Lea de Jong from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/&quot;&gt;Maastricht University&lt;/a&gt;, and Bernd Rechel from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.euro.who.int/en/about-us/partners/observatory&quot;&gt;European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies&lt;/a&gt;, was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Health Services Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that undocumented migrants face particular challenges in using healthcare services in many European countries. Migrants without a proper registration tend to go to clinics for free primary care or directly to hospitals rather than consulting general practitioners. Fear of being deported and the limited entitlements to healthcare are usually the key explanations. For example, in Germany, Denmark and Belgium, undocumented migrants are only provided with access to emergency care or sometimes to services for specific conditions (e.g. infectious diseases) or specific needs (e.g. maternal healthcare).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even in the case of &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article-abstract/27/6/990/4582891?redirectedFrom=PDF&quot;&gt;maternal healthcare&lt;/a&gt;, which undocumented migrants are usually entitled to access in Europe, under-utilization and inadequate care are reported. A typical example of this is the late appearance of pregnant undocumented women in clinics. Lack of awareness of entitlements and need of care, or uncertainty and fear of consequences are likely to be contributing factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9756&quot; style=&quot;width: 210px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9756 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/bhsr-2-200x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Source: iStock image from author&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we focus on healthcare use, we recognize that undocumented migrants are exceptionally vulnerable, not only because they face numerous barriers in utilizing healthcare services, but also because their other basic human needs are not met. However, research evidence is still scarce due to the inherent challenges in doing research on undocumented migrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, research on this topic is especially needed in countries which provide limited rights to undocumented migrants. Research data are important to demonstrate the scope and scale of the problem, and bring the issue to the attention of decision-makers.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Activity dependent structural plasticity continuously reshapes cortical
circuits. While the reconfiguration of excitatory circuits is known to produce
functional changes, studies have recently shown that this is accompanied by the
simultaneous remodelling of inhibitory circuits also. Further, recent evidence
suggests that inhibition plays a critical role in the structural
reorganization of neural circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, I shall provide an overview of the observations documented in
the literature, discuss proposed mechanisms underlying structural plasticity,
and summarise questions that require further study.&lt;/p&gt;

From &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-52624-001&quot;&gt;Verschuere et al 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What lies at the dark heart of psychopathy? Is it a lack or emotion and empathy, a willingness to manipulate others – or, perhaps, a failure to take responsibility for misdeeds? All of these traits, and many more, are viewed as aspects of a psychopathic personality. But there’s still a debate among experts about which of these are core, and which less important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-52624-001&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; of 7,450 criminal offenders in the US and the Netherlands, published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Abnormal Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, has identified what the researchers believe are the psychopath’s most “central” traits . But while there were striking similarities in the data from the two countries, there were also intriguing differences. This raises the question: does the meaning of the term “psychopath” vary between cultures?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33214&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Netherlands and the US, led by Bruno Verschuere at the University of Amsterdam, analysed the offenders’ scores on the widely-used Psychopathy Checklist – Revised (PC-R). The PC-R comprises 20 questions about a range of traits related to four aspects of psychopathy: &lt;em&gt;affective problems&lt;/em&gt; (a lack of empathy, fearlessness, and shallow emotional experience); &lt;em&gt;interpersonal&lt;/em&gt; (being detached or a pathological liar, for example); &lt;em&gt;lifestyle&lt;/em&gt; (being irresponsible and having poor behavioural control, for example); and &lt;em&gt;being antisocial&lt;/em&gt; (showing early behavioural problems, and later criminal behaviour).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 20 to 22 per cent of the US offenders, and 28 per cent of the offenders in the Netherlands, were clinical psychopaths, based on their PC-R scores (as judged by trained research assistants in each country who drew on “extensive interview and collateral file information” for each offender). This difference between the countries was not a surprise, as the group from the Netherlands were all violent, mentally unwell offenders, whereas one US group consisted of general offenders from state prisons in Wisconsin, and the other comprised offenders in jail or on substance treatment programmes in five other US states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers performed a “network analysis” on the offenders’ PC-R scores, mainly focused on centrality – so, among clinical psychopaths, identifying which item or items were most often present. But they also looked at relationships between items – so if pathological lying was present, for example, then identifying which other items were often, or rarely, present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that “callousness/lack of empathy” was the most central item in both of the US samples. As the researchers note, “this aligns with classic clinical descriptions and prototypicality studies of psychopathy.” But for the offenders from the Netherlands, while “callousness/lack of empathy” was fairly central, a “parasitic lifestyle” and “irresponsibility” were most central.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the US samples, the items that appeared most peripheral to psychopathy were “many short-term marital relations”, “lack of realistic long-term goals” (in the Wisconsin offenders only) and “revocation of conditional release” (this refers to failing to fulfil the terms of probation, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the offenders from the Netherlands, “Promiscuous sexual behaviour” and “many short-term marital relations” were also among the most peripheral items, but, surprisingly, so too was “shallow affect”, an item that was actually the second most-central for the Wisconsin group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to address the non-geographical differences between the US and Dutch groups, the researchers extracted a subsample from the Dutch group, excluding those with indications of current or past severe psychopathology, but the results still showed that a parasitic lifestyle and irresponsibility (not callousness, as in the US groups), were the most central items for psychopaths in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results raise the possibility, the researchers suggest, that there might be cross-cultural differences in how psychopathy manifests – or at least in how the PC-R is scored by trained raters in different counties. Further work should help to clarify this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Extending network analyses to different measures, samples and cultures should shed further light on the core characteristics of psychopathy,” they write, “and perhaps ultimately on the unresolved question of what psychopathy is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-52624-001&quot;&gt;What features of psychopathy might be central? A network analysis of the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) in three large samples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public Library of Science (PLOS) and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cshl.edu/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSHL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) announce an agreement that enables the automatic posting of research articles submitted to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/which-journal-is-right-for-me&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS journals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;on bioRxiv, CSHL’s preprint server for the life sciences. This collaboration between &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and PLOS empowers authors to share their work on a trusted platform before peer review, accelerating the pace of biomedical research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS is committed to enhancing the integrity of preprints and confidence in them as research outputs. PLOS will perform initial manuscript screening compatible with bioRxiv standards, covering scope, plagiarism, and previous publication, as well as other basic ethical and technical criteria. Articles will then post automatically to the bioRxiv server without the need for additional actions by the author. By allowing their submission to be posted on bioRxiv, authors accelerate the dissemination of their work and invite commentary by a broader community, which the PLOS editors will evaluate as part of peer review. Authors may choose to opt-out of this process when they submit papers to PLOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS and CSHL also plan to work collaboratively towards solutions for preprint licensing that enable broad dissemination and reuse; the addition of badges to papers which signal that additional services for authors have been performed by PLOS and potentially other organizations; submission and screening standards in the biomedical sciences; and the implementation of new forms of manuscript assessment to augment or improve current methods of peer review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;“The opportunity to partner with a like-minded organization such as CSHL to realize a longstanding PLOS goal is a strategy for us moving forward,” said &lt;strong&gt;Alison Mudditt, Chief Executive Officer, PLOS&lt;/strong&gt;. “A key part of our mission has always been to act as a catalyst, not only demonstrating the viability of new models through our own operations but also supporting them elsewhere. In the case of preprints, we can magnify our impact by partnering and helping shape how that future develops for all posted content on bioRxiv.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bioRxiv preprint server was initiated by CSHL in November 2013 and received major support in May 2017 from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. It currently hosts over 20,000 manuscripts from bioscientists in 104 countries and has a rapidly rising rate of submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;“Helping researchers communicate at the speed of science has been the principal goal of bioRxiv since its launch,” said &lt;strong&gt;John Inglis, co-founder of bioRxiv at CSHL&lt;/strong&gt;, “and over one hundred thousand authors have taken advantage of that opportunity. We are delighted to have reached an agreement with PLOS to offer that benefit to tens of thousands more authors who are ready to share their work and open it up to the community response and feedback that bioRxiv makes possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;“This collaboration highlights &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/10/the-best-of-both-worlds-preprints-and-journals/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS’ commitment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to the growing preprint movement in the biological sciences and bioRxiv’s support for scientists’ desire to share their research freely and widely,” said &lt;strong&gt;Louise Page, Chief Innovation Officer, PLOS&lt;/strong&gt;. “The screened submissions to bioRxiv from PLOS illustrate how publishers can drive preprints and create new outputs in response to researcher-led initiatives that increase transparency and promote early dissemination of science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 Nearly all of the editorial board members of a 150-year-old journal about the molecular underpinnings of medicine and disease have resigned their posts, protesting changes by publisher SpringerNature that they say “jeopardized the future and scholarly legacy of the Journal.” In a December 1 letter, led by the three former editors in chief of the […]</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/sunset-3094989_960_720-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning. True meaning. And Covfefe. Capturing the words we say or write down and how they fit in with our everyday lived experience is changing. A long time ago, I learned that the lower the ‘n’ value (the number of subjects in a given study or analysis), the worse the likelihood of reproducibility, and that n=1 studies are meaningless, instantly dismissible. Don’t even read on if you see ‘n=1’, you are wasting your time. Whilst this holds for most types of research, what if n=1 is an interview, or a narrative account that makes history or closely aligns with our own or even wider societal experiences, and how we make sense of the world? What if it qualitatively analyses and interprets each word, and deduces new meaning or future research questions and trends? The Frost-Nixon interviews are a series of n=1, for instance, but every line, every word spoken has been analyzed and transcribed for posterity, and remains relevant to this day. What if it is a letter of note, from one person to another, that affects us all? Or a blog, or a podcast, or a video?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been living with the reality of cancer in our lives for nearly 5 years…it becomes the new normal”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt; Dr. Kate Granger MBE &lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article by Claudia Pagliari and Joanna Taylor published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Palliative Care&lt;/em&gt; is not an interview, but a transcript of Twitter postings by the late &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Granger&quot;&gt;Dr Kate Granger&lt;/a&gt;. Kate and I worked on a few projects together, after meeting on Twitter, and I have also had the good fortune to meet her husband Chris Pointon, who carries on with the great work around the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hellomynameis.org.uk/&quot;&gt;#HelloMyNameIs&lt;/a&gt; hashtag. So many people reacted to Kate’s tweets, which draw on her experiences as a doctor, and what she made of the world of patients when she entered the realm of end of life care. I challenge you to look at her Twitter page and not glean some new understanding, or connect with her perspectives and points of view. Her quest for respect and true shared decision making is remarkable and tenacious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study looks at each Tweet, categorizes it into distinct themes and analyses content (qualitative content analysis) in the last 6 months of Kate’s life and relates it to end-of-life care trajectories. It also explores and discusses the value of social media data for understanding patients’ personal experiences and coping strategies. The authors offer several apologies for the fact this is a study of one, including a lengthy ‘Limitations’ section, that reflects perhaps research’s ‘quick-to-point-the-finger’ attitude towards this newer type of analysis. The world of social media is raw, unfiltered, impolite, sometimes hysterical, hence very different to the more traditional, carefully prepared and audio-recorded qualitative interview. Researchers can find some really fascinating insights here, and should not let a lack of imagination or experience among their peers stop them from stepping into the fray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m exhausted of being ‘brave’, the expectation that I’m ‘Dr Kate Granger’ and therefore can cope with anything. I can’t…”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt; Dr. Kate Granger MBE &lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is a window into an individual’s experiences, including at highly emotional and sensitive stages, something that is not afforded to research in many other settings. One of my first queries was the issue of consent, but the authors had talked to her husband Chris and asked him permission to use Kate’s openly available Twitter data. I know of social media research where this has not happened, and ethically it raises an issue of consent for me. Interestingly, some researchers I discuss this with seem to believe that any openly available social media data is ‘fair research game’. Many ethics committees I have talked to remain under prepared for this important question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Pointon agreed to this work, knowing that Kate would have been honored and humbled. Kate’s immense drive and determination live on, and you will see Tweets written in pain, written in awe. Could this very special n=1 become part of a social media narrative analysis trend, that we are only beginning to understand? Future versions of already existing Artificial Intelligence algorithms, like Deep Learning, may swiftly data-mine thousands, millions, billions of such rich thematic sentences to help generate and aid actual real life decision support for palliative and end of life care. We are seeing a significant change in the way history is noted down. The way past experience is used to inform decision parameters for future generations, will likely take into account every single sentence that has ever been written on Twitter and indeed the internet. Whether this is your idea of a nightmare, or you see this as an immense opportunity, will continue to divide opinion for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9879&quot; style=&quot;width: 374px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9879 size-full&quot; height=&quot;181&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;364&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Image from Shutterstock, by Creative Family&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the use of psychotropic drugs in European nursing homes is reported to be common, few studies have examined the prevalence and persistency of psychotropic drug use in nursing home residents. Among nursing home residents with dementia or cognitive impairment, the prevalence of any psychotropic drug use is similar to or even higher than among those with normal cognition. However, there is limited research surrounding the use of psychotropic drugs in a longitudinal design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 72-month longitudinal study carried out by Helvik &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers found persistent and highly prevalent use of psychotic drugs across 26 nursing homes in Norway. They found the use of conventional antipsychotics did not differ between residents with or without dementia at any time point, and that at two consecutive time points, the use of both atypical and conventional antipsychotics was as high as 50%. Furthermore, they also revealed that less-severe dementia was associated with persistent use of sedatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers concluded that this highly prevalent use of psychotropic drugs may indicate that treatment is not in line with current recommendation, and that clinicians should monitor effects of psychotropic drug treatment and be prepared to stop treatment when the risk of use is not balanced by significant benefits to the patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-017-0499-z&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical activity among hospitalized older adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitalisation due to present disease has been shown to be a risk factor for loss of ambulatory ability in older adults. Previous studies have found that geriatric patients have a low level of psychical activity when hospitalised, spending around only 3.7-5.8% of their day either standing or walking (&amp;lt;83 minutes). This low level of activity is often associated with worse prognosis in patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their observational study, Evensen and colleagues found that time spent upright by 38 patients was higher than had previously been reported in comparable studies, with patients spending almost two hours upright each day. Their findings show no association between age, cognitive impairment, burden of comorbidity and physical activity, highlighting that it is possible to mobilize even acutely admitted geriatric patients. Ultimately, further research is needed to evaluate if mobilization regimes could improve outcomes in geriatric patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-017-0513-5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental health determines well-being in later life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9880&quot; style=&quot;width: 306px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9880&quot; height=&quot;197&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;296&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Image from Shuttershock, by Monkey Buisness Images&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjective well-being refers to a person’s positive evaluation of their psychological functioning and experience, as well as the absence of mental illness. Debated findings have shown that in Western countries, well-being reaches its minimum around midlife due to the onset of adverse life events such as mental and physical decline, disease and disability, as well as loss of independence and companionship – factors that increase with age. Therefore, as life expectancy increases, the new challenge of understanding factors that affect well-being in older adults emerges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, Lukaschek &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;found within their sample of over 3,600 participants, 79% reported high levels of subjective well-being. Their analysis also showed lower levels of subjective well-being in older women than men, with low income, physical inactivity, depression, anxiety and sleeping problems associated with low well-being in both sexes. However, the impact of living alone was only shown to affect subjective well-being in older women, possibly due to the fact women place greater value on social ties than men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their research highlights the need for an increased focus on preventative health interventions among older adults, especially in women living alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-017-0532-2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interactions between alcohol and prescribed medications in older adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol use is rising in older adults, a population especially at risk of harm from drinking.  A systematic review by Holton &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. aimed to estimate the prevalence of the use of alcohol with alcohol-interacting medications in this population.  They found that as many as one third of older adults are at risk of interactions between alcohol and prescribed medications, indicating a need for more longitudinal studies to examine associations with adverse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting lack highlighted by the systematic review is a lack of a definitive list of alcohol-interacting medications.   The studies included used diverse lists, which hampered the determination of prevalence.  Additionally, a definitive, validated list would allow the development of guidelines for determining risk when prescribing and for alcohol interventions in high-risk groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-017-0605-2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dying comfortably related to place of care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9881&quot; style=&quot;width: 380px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9881&quot; height=&quot;235&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;370&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Image from Shuttershock, by Impact Photography&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comfort is an important factor in what many perceive to be important for a good death, with almost 92% of older adults prioritizing comfort when planning in advance for this time. While dying at home is often stated as a preference, in actuality a minority of older people die in their own homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK, fewer older people die in hospices or receive specialist palliative care at home than younger age-groups and the trend for older deaths is gradually moving away from death in hospital towards long-term care facilities. Furthermore, those with cognitive impairment are most likely to live in and subsequently die in care homes, while those with no or mild cognitive impairment are more likely to live at home and then be admitted into facilities during their final days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers based in Cambridge investigated how physical and cognitive disability, place of care and place of death related to reported comfort in very old people’s final illness. In interviews with relatives/close carers after a patient passed, 44% were described as having been “comfortable” during their illness, whilst only 7% of relative described the deceased as having been “uncomfortable”.  Patients were also four times as likely to have been described as comfortable if they died in a care home or their own home, compared with a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/523357434/0/oupblogpsychology/"/>

		<updated>2018-02-06T11:30:36+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;For 15 years I have counseled patients about what it means to carry a mutation in a gene that can lead to a higher risk of developing cancer. Hundreds of times I have said, “A mutation was found.” Our patients have different mutations in different genes. They come from different parts of the world. They speak a variety of languages, and bring their cultural heritage and expectations to our sessions. Their initial reactions are different; for some it is shock and sadness and for others it is relief to have an explanation and a tool for prevention. Yet, the same question is asked by almost everyone: “What does this mean for my family?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most patients, it means their parents, brothers, sisters, and children all have at least a 50% chance of carrying the same gene mutation. The implications are significant. While inherited cancer conditions lead to a greatly elevated risk for certain cancers, often at ages younger than typically seen, there are steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing cancer or to detect it at earlier stages. However, to take advantage of these potentially life-saving interventions an individual needs to know if they carry the family mutation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I disclose genetic test results to a client, we discuss which family members to inform and how the patient will do so. I give them a sample letter to share with their family, along with copies of their result. Armed with these tools and a crash course in genetics, patients are then asked to share information with family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“While inherited cancer conditions lead to a greatly elevated risk for certain cancers, often at ages younger than typically seen, there are steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing cancer or to detect it at earlier stages.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple, right? You know you carry a mutation so you go home and tell your family. But families are not simple and communicating is inherently complex—as we can all attest. Just imagine how and what you would tell your relatives. Who might be more interested in this information? What current family dynamics might make the conversation difficult?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen the downstream effects of this communication played out in clinic, both with the scenario of early-stage cancer detected in someone known to be at high-risk who is undergoing the right screening at the right time, as well as the more devastating flipside of a late-stage diagnosis that might have been prevented had gene mutation information been shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after a mutation is identified in a family, many people remain unaware and more than half of at-risk relatives don’t undergo genetic testing. We asked 136 of our patients with gene mutations: &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibx010&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;What happened after they were given their genetic test results?&lt;/a&gt; Our work was based at two Los Angeles hospitals (University of Southern California Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center) and at Stanford University Cancer Institute in Palo Alto, CA. Ninety-six percent of our patients shared with us that they had told a family member about their genetic test results. Encouragingly, 30% said family members had undergone genetic testing, some within the first three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past research has been almost exclusively conducted in ethnically homogenous, predominately Caucasian groups. Uniquely, our study reflects the diversity of California, with 40% of the patients identifying themselves as being of Hispanic/Latino ancestry, 10% as having Asian ancestry, and 41% identifying with a Caucasian, non-Hispanic background. In addition to ethnic diversity, more than a third of our patients spoke a language other than English, more than 40% had less than a high-school education, and almost half were born outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, there were no major differences among these diverse groups when asked about whether they shared their genetic test information with their family. However, some subtle differences emerged. For example, we also asked if they &lt;em&gt;encouraged &lt;/em&gt;their family to undergo genetic testing. Our patients of Asian ancestry were less likely than those of Caucasian ancestry to report having encouraged their family to undergo genetic testing. Yet, the same patients of Asian ancestry were eight times as likely to report that their family members had undergone genetic testing. Why? Maybe their relatives were more motivated to undergo genetic testing after being informed and less encouragement was needed. Or there could be cultural differences in how “encouraging family members” is defined or how acceptable it might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There can be great hope in genetic information, despite its psychological weight. The maximum benefit of genetic information requires it to move through families. We found that our diverse patients, to whom we had to say, “a cancer gene mutation was found,” did, in fact, communicate this genetic test result to their family. And many of their family members went on to get the right genetic test within a matter of months. However, culturally informed interventions are needed to support and facilitate communication for families, as well as to enhance the preventive impact of genetic information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any context that encourages us to focus on a person’s body, more than their mind, is said to lead to objectification, such as when, in a previous era, a Formula One fan looked upon an attractive “grid girl” dressed in revealing clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most serious concern about objectification is that it can lead us to disregard the rights and experiences of the objectified person. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0361684313485718&quot;&gt;past research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that we’re more inclined to blame a rape victim depicted in a bikini, and more willing to (hypothetically) administer &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.755/full&quot;&gt;painful tablets&lt;/a&gt; to men and women shown wearing swim wear, rather than fully clothed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945217304045&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Cortex&lt;/em&gt; has taken things further by showing that volunteers’ empathy-related brain activity was diminished when they saw an objectified woman suffering social rejection, as compared with a woman who wasn’t objectified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33199&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text given-name&quot;&gt;Carlotta &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text surname&quot;&gt;Cogoni at the University of Trento, and her colleagues scanned the brains of 36 young adult participants (including 19 women) while they played or watched a simple ball-passing game over the internet. The other two players were supposedly located elsewhere, but really the games were mostly pre-programmed. When the participants played, they passed the ball back and forward with two other people depicted only by their hands on-screen. Each game lasted about 18 seconds, and during some games, the participant was completely ignored by the other players. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text surname&quot;&gt;Most important were the games in which the participants were mere spectators, and they could see one of the three female players at the centre of the screen, either dressed in trousers and sweatshirt and light make-up, or “sexually objectified” – wearing a short dress, high heels and heavy make-up. Two research assistants performed this role in different versions of the game, switching their clothing and make-up to appear objectified or not (questionnaires after the study confirmed that the women were considered sexier but less intelligent, and less capable of agency when depicted in the objectifying context).  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the participants were playing the game and they were ignored by the other players, this showed up in their brains, in terms of increased activity in areas involved in physical pain, such as the somatosensory cortex. When they saw a woman in trousers and sweatshirt being ignored by the other players, this was also reflected in the participants’ brains, in terms of increased activity in areas involved in emotional pain (such as anterior insula and anterior middle cingulate cortex) and taking other people’s perspective (medial frontal cortex). Crucially, activity in these regions – which the researchers believe reflects the neural basis of empathy for social pain – was lower when the participants, male and female, saw an objectified woman rejected by the other players, compared with when they saw a non-objectified woman rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also asked their participants to report what emotions, positive or negative, they were feeling at the end of each game, and when they were spectators, to report what emotions the woman at the centre of the screen was feeling. In fact no differences emerged for negative emotion following social rejection: when the woman at the centre of the screen was rejected by the other players, the participants said they thought she was feeling just as much negative emotion whether she appeared objectified or not (somewhat contradicting the neural evidence). Intriguingly, however, during the fair games without social rejection, the participants attributed less positive emotion to the objectified woman, than they did to the non-objectified woman (this could be due to objectification or perhaps the participants simply thought it was probably less fun to play ball in a cocktail dress than trousers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ ultimate aim is to better understand “gender-based violence” which they say “disproportionately affects women”, and “constitutes an extensive human rights abuse that the modern society cannot afford to overlook”. They believe their demonstration of reduced neural empathy toward an objectified woman experiencing social rejection “may indicate a possible mechanism behind the motivation of gender-based violent behaviour”. They added that the fact that their female participants also showed reduced neural empathy toward objectified women is consistent with gender violence entailing “not only active participation, but also passive acceptance or compliance and therefore involving both men and women behaviours”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, critics may point out that in fact the participants &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; show empathy towards the women wearing revealing clothes – after all, they attributed just as much negative emotion to them when they were rejected as they did to non-objectified women – and therefore it really doesn’t matter what neurons were firing in their brains. Or should we trust recordings of brain activity over a person’s subjective account of what they believe and feel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more political point is that this study hasn’t shown that viewing objectified women led to less neural empathy for all women. The study actually wasn’t set up to detect this effect, but certainly the researchers documented evidence of heightened neural empathy for the non-objectified women, which would appear to undermine the arguments of some feminists that when women choose to perform roles in which they are objectified, such as working as “grid girls” or models, that this contributes to the objectification of all women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incomparable &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SueReviews&quot;&gt;Sue Fletcher-Watson &lt;/a&gt;and I continue our intermittent blog series on academic life today, this time focusing on the stressful post-PhD employment scene.  There are a number of options for those who want to stay in academia post-PhD, all highly competitive and with unique stressors. Today, we’re talking about one of the most common scenarios: applying for an advertised pot-doc research role in someone else’s lab. In this case, a PI has secured a grant already and is now advertising a clearly defined job, for someone to carry out the project. So how do you get your application to stand out?  How can you impress at interview?  Here’s a few tips, based on our recent experiences of being on the other side of the interview table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address ALL the job criteria, thoroughly but succinctly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job adverts normally list essential and desirable criteria. In your application, compose a cover letter which specifically demonstrates your ability to meet these criteria. You’d be surprised how many people don’t do this, instead providing what amounts to an abstract for their PhD.  This is all well and good, but remember that the selection panel will use the job criteria to rate applicants.  They won’t give you the benefit of the doubt – you must demonstrate what you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is tricky to do this succinctly of course, and criteria like “must have excellent communication skills” can be hard to prove.  “I have excellent communication skills” isn’t exactly convincing. Focus on experiences you’ve had and what they taught you.  e.g. “My PhD was supervised by academics from two very different disciplines (informatics, psychology), enabling me to develop my excellent communication skills.  I ran three novel eye-tracking experiments, recruiting more than 80 autistic adults in 12 months, showing my innovative approach to science and time management abilities”. This tells the panel something about your specific skills in a range of areas: research methods, project management, interpersonal skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t give the panel extra work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very occasionally there is a really good reason to contact the panel before the interview. You might have a pressing question about the planned start date for example, or want to ask about potential to do the role part time. However, even in these cases you’d probably do better to apply and then negotiate on the details afterwards, if you’re offered the job.  If they’ve decided you are the right candidate, they will be much more willing to adapt to your situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More commonly, people get in touch before the interviews to ask questions like “Am I eligible for the job?” This infuriating query amounts to a request to vet your application prior to seeing other candidates, which is entirely unreasonable. The answer to this is always the same: please read the job description and if you think you are eligible then apply. The second type of advance question is along the lines of a proposal to adapt the study: e.g. have you thought about adding in an fMRI element to this? This also gets Sue’s back up. By this stage, the proposal for funding will have been tweaked and adapted in response to comments from multiple co-applicants, internal and external reviewers. It may have been turned down by one or two funders previously. This is not a good time to start to question fundamental components of the design!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, we should note that asking at the interview about where in the protocol there is room to innovate and make your mark on the project is to be encouraged. No-one wants to work with a cipher, just make sure you ask this with a recognition that there is a fixed topic, budget and timeline which you must operate within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For goodness’ sake, proof-read&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to demonstrate your excellent abilities is to show them off in the quality of your application documents. Most scientists will value thoroughness, clarity and precision. Illustrate these qualities by submitting a clearly laid-out CV and cover letter, without typos or grammatical errors. Save it as a pdf so the formatting won’t be messed up by the recipient’s Word template. Don’t submit additional attachments such as reference letters or transcripts of your grades (unless the job advert specifies these). These are superfluous to requirements and just add to the difficulty of screening large numbers of applicants.  It will not work in your favour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aim to submit 24 hours before the deadline so you can check the upload works OK.  Sue once applied for a job very close to the deadline, and found at the last minute that her application file size was larger than that allowed on the system.  Cue frantic panic, adapting the document to get under the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation, preparation, preparation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you’ve been invited to interview?  Well done! Probably only 4 or 5 people have got this far. Most panels will ask you to prepare something – often a short presentation.  Whatever you do, practice it a lot and keep it to time. Remember that you might be a bit slower on the day if you are nervous (though Sue and Duncan always speed up when anxious…).  Pay close attention to what you’ve been asked to do and stick to the remit. Duncan’s experience is that candidates often overrun… and he has now taken to cutting people off mid-sentence. Everyone should have the same time, and managing the time limit is one of the points of asking interviewees to give a talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare for some standard questions: why do you want this job?  What skills and experiences will you bring to the team?  What do you think are the major challenges for this project? How does it fit in with your personal career goals? Make sure you are familiar with the definitions (or debates over definitions) of key terms linked to the project so you can use these confidently and fluently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be that the project has some aspects which are outside your expertise. Sue recently advertised a job on an autism &amp;amp; bilingualism study. This topic is so under-studied that none of the candidates had detailed expertise in both areas. If this happens to you, make sure you read up on a few of the latest findings in the literature – familiarise yourself with the current big debates so you can mention them if asked. Don’t worry about becoming an expert overnight though – it’s OK to say “I haven’t done work in this area myself…” so long as you follow up with “…but I’ve read a handful of papers to prepare and I was struck by…”.  Your panel will like to see that you care enough about the job to do some reading and won’t expect you to know every detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on your transferable skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your statement and CV, and when preparing for the interview (well done if you get that far!) pull out what type of things you have learned which will be relevant to the project. Your panel are looking for aptitude and abilities that transcend the specific topic.  Maybe you’ve never worked with brain scans, but you have processed and managed large, complex data sets. Maybe you haven’t done research with children, but you did volunteer on a play scheme in the past. Maybe you haven’t done working memory research but you have designed novel tasks to measure attention. Show how what you have done relates to the project by pulling out the common threads – ability to innovate, attention to detail, sensitivity to participant needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve had challenges in the past it is fine to mention these – for example if you’re asked about the experiences you bring to the project. The panel will sympathise with issues recruiting hard to reach populations or making sense of complex patterns in your data.  Make sure though that you present these as problem-solving experiences: this was difficult and this is how we solved the issue. Whatever you think of your former supervisor or boss, don’t complain about them at the interview (yes, this has happened!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the role requires some technical skills, you may find that these are put to the test. Duncan uses a simple ‘data handling’ exercise in his interview process for postdocs. This is undertaken on the day of the interview. Candidates can use any package of their choosing (R, Matlab, Python, Excel), and are typically given 30 minutes to complete the exercise. Be aware that if you have said that you have programming skills then you may have to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show 360º thinking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good researcher will always have multiple levels of a project in mind.  These include the theoretical level – what motivates this research?  What can it tell us theoretically or mechanistically about the way the world works? This should, in turn, relate to the methodological level: how are we going to address this question? Will we develop new methods or work with existing tools? Then there’s the practical level: what resources are needed to carry out this project?  How will they be managed? And finally you will want to consider the human level: who will I be working with – in the research team and as participants? What do they need from me and how can I deliver it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about the job you’re applying for at all of these levels encourages you to consider deeply the pertinent issues that will make the study a success. If you take this approach, you won’t go far wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is possible that after all this you won’t be offered the job.  If that happens, don’t be down-hearted.  In academia, putting yourself out there by applying for jobs, writing papers, giving talks, submitting grants and speaking up in your workplace is essential.  Knock-backs are a core part of the process and one which we must all learn to embrace and grow from. By all means, email the panel and ask for their feedback. But remember, in 90% of cases the difference between you and the successful candidate will be about fit for the role (e.g. specific experience in a specific skill) rather than anything you could have done differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, go for it. &lt;strong&gt;Be brave. Be thorough. Be a good scientist. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/Generic-pink-bacteria-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-016-2161-3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus disease following non-primary maternal infection: a retrospective cohort study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an infection passed from an infected mother to the foetus at birth. Though the infection is common and often asymptomatic, data is scarce. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-016-2161-3&quot;&gt;Hadar &lt;em&gt;et al’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; study compared newborns from mothers previously infected with CMV (non-primary) and mothers infected shortly before or during pregnancy (primary). The study examined the current diagnosis of non-primary infected newborns and aimed to identify risk factors during pregnancy for congenital symptomatic CMV among newborns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9869 alignright&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/pregnant-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disease severity was found to be higher in primary maternal CMV infection. However, symptomatic CMV disease is more common in non-primary infected newborns than primary infected newborns if the mother experiences gestational hypertensive disorders or diabetes mellitus, or takes medication throughout the pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current detection of CMV infection via CMV-IgM is rudimentary and inefficient. This study highlights the need for better diagnostic tools, if non-primary CMV infection substantially increases the chances of symptomatic CMV infection when the mothers experience additional health complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further studies should focus on the prevention of non-primary CMV, as well as improved diagnostic methods, newborn screenings and interventions. This is to prevent poor prognosis among primary and non-primary CMV infected newborns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2445-2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Estimation of the burden of Varicella in Europe before the introduction of universal childhood immunization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9870&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/vaccine-cropped-285x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;285&quot; /&gt;Varicella Zoster Virus, the herpes virus responsible for varicella (more commonly known as chickenpox), is regarded as a mild virus. However, its country-specific burden is often difficult to accurately measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2445-2&quot;&gt;Riera-Montes &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aimed to quantify the burden of varicella across Europe in support of introducing a varicella-vaccination program. A systematic review searched for epidemiological data on the presence of varicella antibodies, primary care, hospitalizations and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although several varicella-targeting vaccines are licensed in the European Union, few member states have implemented their use. In the absence of a universal varicella immunization scheme, the virus could infect 5.5 million people across Europe each year, 3-4 million people would seek a consultation with a physician, more than 20,000 patients could be hospitalized and approximately 80 people could die as a result of infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the most commonly infected would be children aged 5 or under, infected adults would be at a higher risk of hospitalization and death. Although varicella is not considered a serious threat, there is a clear need for improved surveillance strategies and health care at a community level to effectively control the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2394-9&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessing real-time Zika risk in the United States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9872&quot; style=&quot;width: 250px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9872&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/Malaria-signpost-cropped-cc-Ken-Doerr-240x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;cc Ken Doerr&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) in southern US states have highlighted the need for early indicators of ZIKV transmission. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2394-9&quot;&gt;Castro &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; devised a risk-assessment framework comprising: 1) epidemiological estimates of ZIKV importation and transmission rates, 2) ZIKV outbreak simulations, and 3) ZIKV risk analysis to measure the epidemic risk to inform strategic timing and spatial allocation of public health resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framework analysed estimates of ZIKV emergence which proved to be consistent with historic dengue and chikungunya outbreaks. It also detected that metropolitan areas were at a higher risk of importation and southern counties were at a greater risk of higher transmission rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A main concern of public health professionals is the uncertainty they face during ZIKV outbreaks. This framework revealed the significance of reporting and the precision of detection. If most cases are reported quickly, policymakers can allow for cases to accumulate to initiate appropriate interventions and have more confidence in their assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ZIKV prone areas, quick action should be taken upon observing initial cases. In lower risk areas, a delayed response may be a better option in order to minimize unnecessary fear or waste resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2559-6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An integrated study of human and animal infectious disease in the Lake Victoria crescent small-holder crop-livestock production system, Kenya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9873&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/Cow-199x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;199&quot; /&gt;Neglected zoonotic diseases (NZDs) are a major cause of illness in poor communities in tropical and sub-tropical Africa. They are often co-endemic with other infectious diseases – imposing a combined and unquantified burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2559-6&quot;&gt;Fèvre &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt; integrative ‘People, Animals and their Zoonoses’ (PAZ) study used novel human and animal co-sampling techniques and tested for several NZDs and non-zoonotic pathogens to holistically view a community compared to the ‘one-host, one-pathogen, one-outcome’ paradigm which often only focuses on groups most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the community, most people were either infected or exposed to NZDs, where high levels of parasitism were observed. Transmission of and susceptibility to NZDs may be exacerbated by infectious diseases common in developing countries such as malaria and HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study revealed that only a small percentage of the community were aware that infectious diseases can be acquired zoonotically, highlighting the need for more educational programmes in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PAV study may be useful in understanding how zoonotic pathogens contribute to the ecology of endemic infectious diseases in developing countries. The authors expect that the rich dataset from this study will allow them to further explore relationships between specific pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2286-z&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevated prevalence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms in HIV positive men&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multidrug–resistant gram–negative organisms (MDRGNs) are a global threat and are a common healthcare-associated infection. As transmission routes of MDRGN are poorly understood, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2286-z&quot;&gt;Reinheimer &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; investigated the possible transmission of MDRGN through sexual intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-9874&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/Generic-pink-bacteria-225x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of MDRGN was tested in HIV-positive males, where 35 species were detected, with the most common being drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;E. coli.&lt;/em&gt; Importantly, the number of MDRGN found in HIV-positive males was significantly higher than in HIV-negative males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This identifies a potential method of preventing transmission of MDRGN and suggests that HIV-positive men are more susceptible to MDRGN infection. As only limited options are available for the treatment of MDRGN infection, prevention of infection through sexual transmission may be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that pre-existing conditions such as gastrointestinal (GI) diseases and other co-infections may compromise the GI mucosa, potentially influencing the transmission of MDRGN regardless of the transmission route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results from this study suggest that safer sex would not only protect people from STI-associated pathogens but also MDRGN. It would also be worthwhile investigating whether this applies to women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2836-4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention of tick bites: an evaluation of a smartphone app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9875&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9875&quot; height=&quot;271&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/phone-app-flickr-creative-commons-from-okalkavan-cropped-300x271.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;cc okalkavan&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a serious threat with no appropriate vaccine available. Preventative measures are required to avoid tick bites as controlling tick populations is an unrealistic goal. Because smart phone applications (apps) are now commonplace in the Netherlands, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2836-4&quot;&gt;Antonise-Kamp &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; designed an app named ‘Tekenbeet’ (Dutch for ‘tick bite’) to engage people and educate them on ticks and tick bites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app was available for 20 months and during that time, it was downloaded almost 40,000 times. The authors evaluated the app’s effect by requesting users to complete a survey aimed at evaluating usage and satisfaction with Tekenbeet, as well as any influence it may have had on the understanding of tick bites. Collated survey results revealed that the app increased peoples’ knowledge about tick bites and increased their intention to comply with preventative measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the app represents an alternative method in educating the public about infectious diseases.  It proved capable of motivating a range of people to perform their own preventative measures and hopefully reduce the incidences of tick bites. The findings also highlight the versatility and effectiveness of apps in the prevention of infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2890-y/open-peer-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The global effect of maternal education on complete childhood vaccination: a systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are well established correlations between maternal education and reduction in childhood mortalities. One proposed link is that a more educated mother is more likely to have more access to health care and vaccine uptake.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-9876&quot; height=&quot;271&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/vaccination-child-crop-300x271.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2890-y/open-peer-review&quot;&gt;Forshaw &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to establish a correlation between increasing maternal education and vaccine uptake. The analysis showed that the odds of full childhood vaccination were 2.3 times greater in children whose mother received secondary or higher education compared to children whose mother had no education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, vaccine uptake and childhood mortality is not solely linked to the level of education a mother receives; educated women may be more likely to encourage healthier lifestyle choices which may also prevent childhood mortality irrespective of vaccine uptake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study highlights the existing issue that women’s education and gender equality is still in need of major improvement in developing countries. And, whilst this study cannot provide the overall effect of maternal education on vaccination uptake, it demonstrates the positive effect maternal education has on the next generation – this should be taken into consideration when devising health policies aiming to improve vaccine uptake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What counts as music to one person, sounds to another like a headache. Some of the difference is explained by our personalities (for instance, more open-minded people prefer classical) and our thinking style (systematisers prefer heavy metal more than empathisers). What’s not been examined before now, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886917306980&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/em&gt;, is the biological basis of our musical tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33187&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hirokazu Doi at Nagasaki University and his colleagues asked 76 young Japanese adult participants, including 39 women, to listen to, and rate their enjoyment of, twenty-five 15-second musical excerpts. The clips were examples from five musical dimensions based on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3138530/&quot;&gt;system&lt;/a&gt; developed by the British psychologist Peter Rentfrow: Mellow (smooth and relaxing); Contemporary (including rap, funk, and acid jazz); Sophisticated (classical etc); Intense (loud, forceful and energetic); and Unpretentious (country and singer-songwriter genres).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants also completed a personality questionnaire and provided saliva samples which were analysed for testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the men only, there was an inverse correlation between their salivary testosterone level and their preference for sophisticated music (r=-.43). In the men, but not women, salivary testosterone also correlated positively with their personality scores on extraversion, openness-to-experience and agreeableness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, personality did not correlate with musical preferences and there was no evidence that the association between testosterone and musical preference was explained by the links between testosterone and personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To the best of our knowledge, this the first demonstration of the link between biological predisposition and music preference,” the researchers said. They added that their finding “nicely dovetails” with previous biological research suggesting that higher testosterone is associated with rebelliousness and dominance, and other music research showing that young people see listening to classical music as a way to please authority figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886917306980&quot;&gt;Negative correlation between salivary testosterone concentration and preference for sophisticated music in males&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What we don't yet know is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;who will show lasting cognitive and behavioral impairments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;who will show only transient sequelae (and for how long)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;who will manifest long-term neurodegeneration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;...and by which specific cellular mechanism(s)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding to the confusion is the unclear terminology used to describe impact-related head injuries. Is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;according to Wikipedia, it is&quot;&gt;concussion&lt;/a&gt; the same as a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI)? Sharp and Jenkins say absolutely not, and contend that &lt;a href=&quot;http://pn.bmj.com/content/15/3/172.long&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Concussion is confusing us all&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;It is time to stop using the term concussion as it has no clear definition and no pathological meaning.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This confusion is increasingly problematic as the management of ‘concussed’ individuals is a pressing concern. Historically, it has been used to describe patients briefly disabled following a head injury, with the assumption that this was due to a transient disorder of brain function without long-term sequelae. However, the symptoms of concussion are highly variable in duration, and can persist for many years with no reliable early predictors of outcome. Using vague terminology for post-traumatic problems leads to misconceptions and biases in the diagnostic process, producing uninterpretable science, poor clinical guidelines and confused policy. We propose that the term concussion should be avoided. Instead neurologists and other healthcare professionals should classify the severity of traumatic brain injury and then attempt to precisely diagnose the underlying cause of post-traumatic symptoms.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an interview about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocomplimenter.blogspot.com/2018/02/concussions-not-necessary-for-cte.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Concussions not necessary for CTE, according to impressive mouse model &quot;&gt;impressive&lt;/a&gt; mega-paper by &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/141/2/422/4815697&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tagge, Fisher, Minaeva, et al. (2018)&lt;/a&gt;, co-senior author &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bumc.bu.edu/psychiatry/profile/4779/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Lee Goldstein&lt;/a&gt; also said no, but had a different interpretation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;When it comes to head injuries and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Focus-Research/Traumatic-Brain-Injury/NIH-Chronic-Traumatic-Encephalopathy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;chronic traumatic encephalopathy&quot;&gt;CTE&lt;/a&gt;, Goldstein spoke of three categories that are being jumbled: concussions, TBI and CTE. &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concussion, he says, is a syndrome&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; defined “by consensus really every couple of years, based on the signs and symptoms of neurological syndrome, what happens after you get hit in the head. It’s nothing more than that, a syndrome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A TBI is different. “it is an injury, an event,” he said.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “It’s not a syndrome. It’s an event and it involves damage to tissue. If you don’t have a concussion, you can absolutely have brain injury and the converse is true.”&lt;br /&gt;. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“So concussion may or may not be a TBI and equally important not having a  concussion may or may not be associated with a TBI. A concussion  doesn’t tell you anything about a TBI. Nor does it tell you anything about CTE.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I'm even more confused now... you can have concussion (the syndrome) without an injury or an event?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I'm really here to tell you about 8 post-mortem brains from teenage males who had engaged in contact sports. These were from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bu.edu/cte/about/leadership/ann-mckee-md/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Ann McKee&lt;/a&gt;'s brain bank at BU, and were included in the paper along with extensive data from a mouse model (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/141/2/422/4815697&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tagge, Fisher, Minaeva, et al., 2018)&lt;/a&gt;. Four brains were in the acute-subacute phase after mild closed-head impact injury and had previous diagnoses of concusion. The other 4 brains were control cases, including individuals who also had previous diagnoses of concussion. Let me repeat that. The controls had ALSO suffered head impact injuries at unknown (“not recent”) pre-mortem dates (&amp;gt;7 years prior in one case). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This amazing and important work was made possible by magnanimous donations from grieving parents. I am very sorry for the losses they have suffered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is a summary of the cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Case 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;18 year old multisport athlete &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;

Only 2 of the cases showed hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00401-015-1515-z&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The first NINDS/NIBIB consensus meeting to define neuropathological criteria for the diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy&quot;&gt;characteristic&lt;/a&gt; of CTE. But in the media (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/18/health/cte-concussion-repeated-hits-study/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;It's not concussions that cause CTE. It's repeated hits&lt;/a&gt;), all of these changes have been conflated with CTE, a neurodegenerative condition that presumably develops over a longer time scale. Overall, the argument for a neat and tidy causal cascade is inconclusive in humans (in my view), because hyperphosphoralated tau was not observed in any of the controls, including those with significant histories of concussion. Or in Cases 2 and 3. Are we to assume, then, that concussions do not produce tauopathy in all cases? Is there a specific “dose” of head impact required? The &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocomplimenter.blogspot.com/2018/02/concussions-not-necessary-for-cte.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Concussions not necessary for CTE, according to impressive mouse model &quot;&gt;mouse model&lt;/a&gt; is more precise in this realm, and those results seemed to drive the credulous headlines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Importantly, the authors admit that &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Clearly, not every individual who sustains a head injury, even if repeated, will develop CTE brain pathology.” &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Conversely, CTE pathology can occur without having suffered a single blow to the head (&lt;a href=&quot;https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijpcr/international-journal-of-pathology-and-clinical-research-ijpcr-3-050.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gao et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, there's still a lot to learn. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gao AF, Ramsay D, Twose R, Rogaeva E, Tator C, Hazrati LN.

&lt;p&gt;Imagining ourselves as no longer existing is, for most of us, terrifying. Buddhism may offer some reassurance. A central tenet of the religion is that all is impermanent and the self is actually an illusion. If there is no self, then why fear the end of the self?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out if the logic of the Buddhist perspective eliminates existential fear, Shaun Nichols at the University of Arizona and his colleagues surveyed hundreds of monastic Tibetan Buddhists (monks-in-training) in exile in India, as well as lay Tibetans, Tibetan Buddhists from Bhutan, Indian Hindus and American Christians and atheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To their astonishment, the researchers &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.12590/abstract&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Cognitive Science&lt;/em&gt; that fear of the annihilation of the self was most intense among the monastic Buddhists, and that the monastic Buddhists were less willing than any of the other groups to sacrifice years of their own life for a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33162&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US participants were recruited online, whereas the monastic Tibetan Buddhists and other groups were given paper surveys to complete, translated by fluent bilinguals into the appropriate language. The hundreds of monastic Tibetan Buddhists who took part were from monasteries in Byalkuppe and Mundhod in India. The researchers also surveyed 30 Buddhist scholars about how devoted Buddhists ought to answer the different survey questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the surveys addressed the permanence of the self. As expected, the monastic Buddhists showed the least belief in the continuity of the self – they thought they would be different in personality, beliefs, ambitions and other characteristics in the future. In contrast, the Americans, whether religious or not, showed the strongest belief in the continuity of the self (the other groups, including everyday, non-devout Tibetans, scored mid-way between these two extremes). Similar patterns emerged for beliefs about the existence of a “core self” that persists over time, with the monastic Buddhists again showing the least belief in the self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would the monastic Buddhists’ scepticism about the self have a bearing on their fear of death? More than the other groups, they said that they used the no-self doctrine to cope with the prospect of death, as the Buddhists scholars said they ought to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, when the researchers surveyed their participants about their fear of death and especially their fear of self-annihilation (gauged by agreement or not with items like “Dying one year from now frightens me because of the loss and destruction of the self / destruction of my personality”), to the researchers’ surprise they found that this fear was most intense among the monastic Buddhists. This was opposite to how they ought to have responded according to the Buddhist scholars. Note, the Buddhists believed just as strongly in an after-life (though not, of course, for their current “self”), so this could not explain their more intense fear compared with the other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers surveyed more participants from the same groups about how much they would be willing to sacrifice years of their own life to extend the life of another person (for instance, in the most extreme version of the thought experiment, they were asked to imagine they could take a pill to extend their own life by six months or give the pill to a stranger, similar to them, for whom the pill would add an additional five years to their life). The monastic Buddhists were the least willing to make this kind of sacrifice – in fact, over 72 per cent preferred to keep the pill for themselves in the above scenario, compared with 31.2 per cent of non-religious Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing on Twitter, co-author Nina Strohminger at the University of Pennsylvania said that these findings were “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NinaStrohminger/status/955443909508952065&quot;&gt;probably the most bizarre and unexpected of her career&lt;/a&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe the paradox they have uncovered, between the Buddhists’ explicit beliefs and their fears, may be explicable by the fact that, despite their training and explicit claims, the monastic Buddhists still have a powerful sense of a continuous identity that stretches from the past and into the future. It is not easy to defy the illusion of the self even if you are taught to do so. This would seem to be borne out by notable Buddhist autobiographies that betray a keen experience of a continuous self. At the same time, Buddhists may succeed well in truly believing that the self ends at death (unlike other religious groups that preach that the soul is eternal), and this could account for the Buddhists’ exaggerated fear of self-annihilation at death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One caveat to the findings highlighted by the researchers is that, although their monastic Buddhist participants meditated every day,  none of them were highly experienced, long-term meditators with many years of practice. Meditation is seen as one way to eliminate belief in a permanent self, so it will be interesting to repeat the research, not only with other Buddhist denominations, but specifically with highly experienced, expert Buddhist meditators, to see if they too would fear self-annihilation.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/fossilpic-140x110.gif&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-1076-y&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-evaluation of the Haarlem Archaeopteryx and the radiation of maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9739&quot; style=&quot;width: 267px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9739&quot; height=&quot;245&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/fossilpic-300x286.gif&quot; width=&quot;257&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Image taken from article&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Image taken from article&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 1861 and Hermann von Meyer, a German paleontologist, inspects a slab of Bavarian limestone depicting a single feather. He will name this specimen archaeopteryx, signifying an “ancient wing” or “feather”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same year, the first Archaeopteryx skeleton was discovered, depicting what was to be considered the oldest known ancestor of the modern bird for decades to come. Marking the boundary between bird and dinosaur, this iconic fossil has been pivotal to our understanding of avian evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, the authors re-examined one of the least complete specimens of Archaeopteryx, currently located in the Teylers Museum in Haarlem.  After conducting anatomical analysis, they concluded the “Haarlem specimen” was more likely to have descended from the Chinese Anchiornis, a group of winged dinosaurs that predate the Archaeopteryx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study has had fascinating implications for our understanding of the origins of modern birds. The authors propose a westward spread of the avian ancestors from their origins in East Asia and arriving in Bavaria, where their remains would be found 350 million years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-1080-2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new species of Xenoturbella from the western Pacific Ocean and the evolution of Xenoturbella&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9862&quot; style=&quot;width: 144px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9862 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/12862_2017_1080_Fig2_HTML-134x300.gif&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Image taken from article&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the extinct to the extant, we move on to the discovery of a new species of Xenoturbella; a truly bizarre marine organism. Until recently, this mysterious creature had only been collected in the seas off the coast of Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would not be difficult to mistake Xenoturbella for an old sock, lying abandoned on the sea bed.  Its morphology is very simple and its behavioral habits unknown.  Even its phylogenetic position has been keenly debated throughout recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Xenoturbella’s most defining characteristics are the absence of an anus and the lack of a centralized nervous system. Its mouth serves as the single opening through which food and waste can be exchanged. These remarkable traits make it an attractive choice for investigating the evolutionary origins of these features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A paper published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Evolutionary Biology&lt;/em&gt; this year reports the identification of a new species of Xenoturbella in the Western Pacific Ocean off the coast of Japan. It is relatively easily collected via marine biology dredge and thus holds a lot of promise as a research organism for the further characterization of this strange species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-1025-9&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epigenetic variation between urban and rural populations of Darwin’s finches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9863&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9863 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;260&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/12862_2017_1025_Fig1_HTML-300x260.gif&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Image taken from article&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travelling across to the far side of the Pacific Ocean, the authors of our next paper go to the Galapagos Islands to study Darwin’s finches. These birds are best known for helping shape Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection. There are 16 species native to the Galapagos islands, each most clearly identified by their differing beak sizes and shapes that are adapted to the different food sources found on each island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 160 years later, the field of epigenetics may provide an explanation for the rapid adaptation that these finches display. Epigenetics refers to the study of changes in gene expression rather than the genetic code, achieved through modifications of DNA by processes such as methylation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA methylation describes the addition of a carbon and three hydrogen atoms to a cytosine nucleotide, when followed by a guanine, in the order “CpG”. Some methylation patterns have been shown to be heritable, while methylation patterns have even displayed a mutation rate higher than that observed in the genetic code. Crucially, for this study, the environment has also been reported to influence DNA methylation patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This points to the possibility that epigenetics may contribute to quick phenotypic changes within each species of Darwin’s Finches. However, the process through which this could happen is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After studying two species of finch, the authors reported significant differences in methylation patterns between urban and rural populations of each species. Urbanization in the Galapagos Islands has happened within the last 60 years, so while the authors are careful to acknowledge the possibility of random epigenetic drift, if urbanization is the cause for these differences in methylation then these changes have occurred impressively quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-0936-9&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A genetic chronology for the Indian Subcontinent points to heavily sex-biased dispersals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9864&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/India_BMNG-289x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;289&quot; /&gt;Our next study examines mitochondrial DNA to determine the ancient ancestry of the modern day Indian population. Between 200,000 and 400,000 years ago, anatomically modern humans were thought to have moved out of east Africa and through the Indian subcontinent, consequently making the Indian population one of the most genetically diverse on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the genetic study of the Indian population is no easy task. High levels of endogamy are common due to rigid social boundaries imposed by the caste system. The upshot of this is variation in the genetic code, known as genetic drift, between these socially isolated populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most interestingly, a movement of people from central Asia around 4000 years ago provides new evidence for the spread of the ancient Indo–European language into India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of this study aimed to remedy these problems by tracing the inheritance of mitochondrial DNA, which is exclusively maternally inherited as well as DNA found exclusively on the Y chromosome, which is exclusively passed down the male line. This allows lineages to be traced for millennia back in time. In combination with genome wide analyses, ancient immigration patterns were able to be deduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory proposing an “Indo-Aryan invasion” to India is highly controversial. It has the potential to explain the presence of Indo-European languages, spoken across the northern half of India, while some have also attributed the origins of the caste system to this hypothetical event. Previously, there had been no archaeological data or genetic data to support any claims this event may have occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is proposed in this paper is a succession of migration waves from Iran, the Caucasus and Anatolia over the period of 50,000 years. Perhaps most interestingly, a movement of people from central Asia around 4000 years ago provides new evidence for the spread of the ancient Indo–European language into India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptics have pointed to the lack of ancient preserved DNA in South Asia to confirm any migration occurred. This study does, however, provide an exciting new perspective on this often disputed topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-1014-z&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going deeper in the automated identification of Herbarium specimens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9865&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9865 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;197&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/12862_2017_1014_Fig4_HTML-300x197.gif&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Image taken from article&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final study in our end of year selection focuses on the use of artificial intelligence to identify new species of plant. Vast numbers of preserved plant specimens have been increasingly archived in a digital format and placed online in publicly available databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As contemporary understanding of plant phylogenetics and evolution develops, our knowledge of plant species becomes outdated and data entries must be revised.  Around 350 million specimens are stored in herbaria around the world. This huge amount of data means that this is no fitting task for mere mortals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, Carranza-Rojas et al designed an algorithm designed to use deep learning to identify plant species based on digital images of preserved plant specimens. The software was able to produce the correct plant species within the top 5 results 90% of the time, while the correct result was the first hit for 70% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep learning technology shows considerable promise in the field of botany, with the potential to revolutionize plant identification. We look forward to further studies and new break-throughs, ushering in the next generation of software in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, transgender people are disproportionately vulnerable to HIV. Furthermore, a lack of specific demographic, epidemiological and behavioral information on transgender populations around the world stops the development of HIV-prevention programs that directly target such groups. Seeking to tackle this problem, Siyan Yi and colleagues worked to gain insights into the characteristics, experiences and HIV status of 1,375 transgender women in Cambodia. As well as providing insights into the diverse lives of these women, the study highlighted a number of key factors which may contribute to a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. High-risk sexual behaviors, along with low levels of HIV testing and high prevalence of sex in exchange for money, were identified as potential driving forces behind transmission. Experiences of discrimination while accessing healthcare through traditional routes and a lack of HIV education may additionally act as barriers to reducing such behavior. Any HIV intervention that seeks to target transgender people in Cambodia must address these factors, and the authors highlight the importance of community-based healthcare in providing inclusive, accessible care, as well as proposing HIV self-testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as potentially effective interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Health is a right for all…it is at the center of our vision of a more sustainable, inclusive and prosperous future&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9858&quot; style=&quot;width: 352px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9858&quot; height=&quot;228&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/35367997916_82ce73d586_k-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;342&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Flickr: Kate Holt/Maternal and Child Survival Program&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These words, delivered by UN Secretary General António Guterres at the recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unmultimedia.org/avlibrary/asset/2060/2060252/&quot;&gt;Universal Healthcare Coverage Forum in Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, are reflected in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, and are representative of widespread attitudes among the international community. However, this rhetoric, argue Alicia Ely Yamin and Allan Maleche, has yet to translate into action at a national level in East Africa.  In an insightful debate article, they highlight ways a human rights-based approach could be used to advance efforts to establish universal healthcare coverage. For example, treating health coverage as a universal human right means access should never be hampered by an individual’s ability to pay. The authors recommend integrating healthcare rights into wider aspects of policy and law, and ensuring meaningful participation of all citizens in setting healthcare priorities. Finally, they call for greater accountability for governments, institutions and programmes whose duty it is to see that healthcare is effective, democratic and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-017-0115-5&quot;&gt;Women’s Attitudes Towards Intimate Partner Violence in Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9856&quot; style=&quot;width: 402px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9856&quot; height=&quot;262&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/14707792095_f00e1e029e_k-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;392&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Flickr: Jessica Lea/Department for International Development&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While intimate partner violence is one of the most widespread forms of gender-based violence globally, attitudes towards such acts can vary enormously, and the legality of “wife-beating” remains a controversial issue in many countries. Wife-beating is a socio-culturally accepted norm in many parts of Ethiopia. Eshetu Gurmy and Senait Endale at Addis Ababa University sought to assess the attitudes of Ethiopian women towards wife-beating, which they suggest has untold effects on the physical and mental health of victims and widespread downstream implications for the socio-economic status and individual freedoms of women across Ethiopian society. Using data from the countrywide Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey, the researchers identified a number of factors that might affect the extent to which women accepted wife-beating as a justified norm. Most markedly, attitudes towards intimate partner violence varied geographically, with women in rural areas being generally more accepting than those in urban areas. Factors such as household income, level of education, age, religion and access to the media may contribute to this disparity. Understanding attitudes towards intimate partner violence is vital in developing interventions that seek to change culturally ingrained behaviors and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-017-0119-1&quot;&gt;Perceptions and experiences of female sex workers in accessing HIV services in Uganda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You can read the health worker’s face which shows that he is looking at something very bad and it makes you feel very bad. When they see us, they see us as animals.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Female sex workers (FSWs) are disproportionately susceptible to HIV contraction, yet often face a unique set of barriers when attempting to access proper care. Rhoda K. Wanyenze and colleagues conducted focus group discussions with 190 sex workers from across Uganda to identify the challenges they face when accessing HIV services. FSWs from all districts involved in the study reported discriminatory and demeaning treatment by healthcare workers, as in the above quote from a sex worker in Kamapala, as well as fears of legal reprisals when seeking care. Some interviewees expressed worries that their HIV positive status would not remain confidential and feared prejudice and reprisals from other sex workers, as well as from wider society. Interviewees highlighted a number of practical barriers to accessing treatment and contraception, such as unfavorable operation times at healthcare facilities, limited availability of condoms at such facilities, and most notably the cost of obtaining a service. HIV prevalence among FSWs in Uganda is estimated at 34%, and qualitative, interview-based studies such as this highlight the personal attitudes and experiences of individuals, informing a specific and more nuanced approach to intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-017-0114-6&quot;&gt;Informing Children of their HIV Status&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9854&quot; style=&quot;width: 367px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9854&quot; height=&quot;238&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/7948879428_0103cc8ddf_b-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;357&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Flickr: UNICEF&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you tell a child that they have HIV? This is a problem faced by millions of parents and caregivers across the globe, and one with important and widespread health-related repercussions. Only through full disclosure can access and adherence to treatment be ensured. While the WHO recommends incremental disclosure of a child’s HIV status while they are of school age, rates of disclosure prevalence vary enormously internationally. Eric Gyamfi and colleagues utilized a mixed methods approach to assess the attitudes of caregivers of children with HIV and the prevalence of disclosure in the Lower Manya-Krobo District of Ghana. They found that only 7.7% of disclosures happened before the age of 11, with many caregivers reporting they felt children would not understand their disease before that age, or would be unable to keep their diagnosis private. As a health service provider reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Telling children can be problematic because children talk a lot. They may actually disclose the diagnosis to others. This will reveal the status of the mother and the rest of the family, which can result in stigmatization towards them.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significant social stigma still attached to HIV/AIDS represents a powerful barrier to timely, informed disclosure, with some parents even reporting fears of rejection or blame by their child. The authors recommend development of disclosure guidelines by the Ghana Health Service, as well as improved support for both children and caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9841&quot; height=&quot;195&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/Wheat_harvest-300x195.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield of wheat (&lt;em&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/em&gt; L.), an important crop, is adversely affected by heat stress in many regions of the world. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying thermotolerance are largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work proved that &lt;em&gt;TaFER-5B&lt;/em&gt; plays an important role in enhancing tolerance to heat stress and other abiotic stresses associated with the ROS scavenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-017-1008-4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unraveling the complexity of transcriptomic, metabolomic and quality environmental response of tomato fruit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-9842&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/Tomato_laboratory_research-199x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;199&quot; /&gt;The environment has a profound influence on the organoleptic quality of tomato &lt;em&gt;(Solanum lycopersicum)&lt;/em&gt; fruit, the extent of which depends on a well-regulated and dynamic interplay among genes, metabolites and sensorial attributes. The authors used a systems biology approach to elucidate the complex interacting mechanisms regulating the plasticity of sensorial traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-016-0960-8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparative RNA-seq based transcriptomic analysis of bud dormancy in grape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9843&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/Abhar-iran-225x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;Bud dormancy is an important biological phenomenon of perennial plants that enables them to survive under harsh environmental circumstances. Grape (&lt;em&gt;Vitis vinifera&lt;/em&gt;) is one of the most grown fruit crop worldwide; however, underlying mechanisms involved in grape bud dormancy are not yet clear. This work was aimed to explore the underlying molecular mechanism regulating bud dormancy in grape, which may pave the way for ultimate improvements in the grape industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-016-0966-2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genome-wide association analysis of seedling traits in diverse Sorghum germplasm under thermal stress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-9844&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/800px-Sorghum_bicolor03-225x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;Climate variability due to fluctuation in temperature is a worldwide concern that imperils crop production. The need to understand how the germplasm variation in major crops can be utilized to aid in discovering and developing breeding lines that can withstand and adapt to temperature fluctuations is more necessary than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors analyzed the genetic variation associated with responses to thermal stresses in a sorghum association panel (SAP), representing major races and working groups, to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with resilience to temperature stress in a major cereal crop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-017-0990-x&quot;&gt;De novo sequencing and comparative transcriptome analysis of the male and hermaphroditic flowers provide insights into the regulation of flower formation in andromonoecious &lt;em&gt;Taihangia rupestris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9845&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/12870_2017_990_Fig1_HTML-300x160.gif&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Taihangia rupestris&lt;/em&gt; is an andromonoecious plant species meaning it bears both male and hermaphroditic flowers within the same individual. However, the establishment and development of male and hermaphroditic flowers in andromonoecious &lt;em&gt;Taihangia&lt;/em&gt; remain poorly understood, due to the limited genetic and sequence information. To investigate the potential molecular mechanism in the regulation of &lt;em&gt;Taihangia&lt;/em&gt; flower formation, the authors used &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; RNA sequencing to compare the transcriptome profiles of male and hermaphroditic flowers at early and late developmental stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-017-0986-6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivable gut bacteria provide a pathway for adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Chrysolina herbacea&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Mentha aquatica&lt;/em&gt; volatiles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-9846&quot; height=&quot;227&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/Chrysolina_herbacea-pjt2-300x227.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chemical cross-talk between plants and insects is required in order to achieve a successful co-adaptation. In response to herbivory, plants produce specific compounds, and feeding insects respond adequately to molecules produced by plants. Here the authors show the role of the gut microbial community of the mint beetle &lt;em&gt;Chrysolina herbacea&lt;/em&gt; in the chemical cross-talk with &lt;em&gt;Mentha aquatica&lt;/em&gt; (or watermint).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-017-1033-3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The impact of drought on wheat leaf cuticle properties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9847&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/Green_wheat-200x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;The plant cuticle is the outermost layer covering aerial tissues and is composed of cutin and waxes. The cuticle plays an important role in protection from environmental stresses and glaucousness, the bluish-white colouration of plant surfaces associated with cuticular waxes, has been suggested as a contributing factor in crop drought tolerance. However, the cuticle structure and composition is complex and it is not clear which aspects are important in determining a role in drought tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the authors analyzed residual transpiration rates, cuticle structure and epicuticular wax composition under well-watered conditions and drought in five Australian bread wheat genotypes with contrasting glaucousness and drought tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-017-0971-0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chloroplast proteome response to drought stress and recovery in tomato (&lt;em&gt;Solanum&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;lycopersicum L.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-9851&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/tomatoes_red_vegetables_healthy_trusses_ripe_bush_tomatoes_tomato_plant-536819-225x300.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;Drought is a major constraint for plant growth and crop productivity that is receiving an increased attention due to global climate changes. Chloroplasts act as environmental sensors; however, only partial information is available on stress-induced mechanisms within plastids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the authors investigated the chloroplast response to a severe drought treatment and a subsequent recovery cycle in tomato through physiological, metabolite and proteomic analyses, giving an original overview on the role of chloroplast as environmental sensor by both coordinating the expression of nuclear-encoded plastid-localized proteins and mediating plant stress response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-017-1020-8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An integrated RNAseq-&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR metabolomics approach to understand soybean primary metabolism regulation in response to &lt;em&gt;Rhizoctonia foliar&lt;/em&gt; blight disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9850 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/11056-soybean-plants-growing-pv-200x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;Rhizoctonia solani&lt;/em&gt; AG1-IA is a devastating phytopathogen causing Rhizoctonia foliar blight (RFB) of soybean worldwide with yield losses reaching 60%. Plant defense mechanisms are complex and information from different metabolic pathways is required to thoroughly understand plant defense regulation and function. Combining information from different “omics” levels such as transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics is required to gain insights into plant metabolism and its regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors studied fluctuations in soybean metabolism in response to &lt;em&gt;R. solani&lt;/em&gt; infection at early and late disease stages using an integrated transcriptomics-metabolomics approach, focusing on the regulation of soybean primary metabolism and oxidative stress tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-017-1187-z&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;De novo transcriptome assembly from flower buds of dioecious, gynomonoecious and chemically masculinized female &lt;em&gt;Coccinia grandis&lt;/em&gt; reveals genes associated with sex expression and modification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9848 alignright&quot; height=&quot;248&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/12870_2017_1187_Fig1_HTML-300x248.gif&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Coccinia grandis&lt;/em&gt; (ivy gourd), is a dioecious member of Cucurbitaceae having heteromorphic sex chromosomes. Chromosome constitution of male and female plants of &lt;em&gt;C. grandis&lt;/em&gt; is 22A + XY and 22A + XX respectively. Earlier it has been reported that a unique gynomonoecious form of &lt;em&gt;C. grandis&lt;/em&gt; (22A + XX) also exists in nature bearing morphologically hermaphrodite flowers (GyM-H). Additionally, application of silver nitrate (AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) on female plants induces stamen development leading to the formation of morphologically hermaphrodite flowers (Ag-H) despite the absence of Y-chromosome. Due to the unavailability of genome sequence and the slow pace at which sex-linked genes are identified, sex expression and modification in &lt;em&gt;C. grandis&lt;/em&gt; are not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study would enable identification of new sex-biased genes for further investigation of stamen arrest, pollen fertility, and AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated sex modification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kids who are better at resisting unhelpful impulses and distractions go on later in life to perform better academically, professionally and socially. But how this kind of self-control develops with age has not been so clear. Teenagers’ show more self-control than children in many ways, but in other respects – think of their propensity for risk-taking – they actually seem to show less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12491/full/&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Developmental Science&lt;/i&gt;, Ania Aïte at Paris Descartes University, France, led research investigating whether this might be because there are two types of impulse control – “cool” control, in which emotions are not involved, and “hot” control, in which they are – and that they might show different developmental trajectories. If so, this could have implications for educational interventions aimed at reducing teens’ sometimes dangerous behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33144&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team studied 56 children (aged about 10), 48 adolescents (aged around 13), and 56 young adults (aged about 21). They all completed two different tests of their inhibitory control. In the emotionally neutral test, a classic version of the famous Stroop task, the participants had to indicate, as quickly but accurately as possible, the ink colour of a colour-denoting word (the word “red” written in blue, for example). It requires inhibitory control to ignore word meaning when there’s a mismatch between the word and its ink colour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a test of “hot” inhibitory control, the participants saw a series of faces displaying either happiness, anger, fear and sadness, each with either a congruent or incongruent emotional word written below. The participants had to indicate the emotion shown on each face, ignoring the word below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the emotionally neutral task, the adults did better than the adolescents, who did better than the younger children – there was linear improvement with age, just as you might expect. But the results for the emotion test were very different. Adults did better than the younger children, but the adolescents performed the worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that the adolescents were worse at &lt;i&gt;identifying &lt;/i&gt;emotions – because when the facial expressions and emotion words matched, there was no difference between their performance and that of the adults. Rather, when there was a face-word mismatch, they found it harder to ignore the emotion word, and to focus only on the facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings appear consistent with the popular idea that adolescence represents a time of heightened sensitivity to emotional stimuli, combined with immature connections between the pre-frontal cortex and emotional brain regions, making it more difficult for them to over-rule inappropriate impulses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If adolescence is associated specifically with poor emotional control, but mature “cool” inhibitory control, this might explain why teens can typically cope fine with exams and other situations that demand “cool control”, yet find it harder than adults to ignore emotional influences, such as friends cheering them on to drink more alcohol, for example. This could explain their characteristically poor decision-making – such as driving while drunk and getting into fights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With poor decision-making being responsible for a rise in mortality during adolescence,” the researchers write, “the present findings could usefully contribute to the development of adolescent’ educational programs centered on hot inhibitory control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12491/full&quot;&gt;Adolescents’ inhibitory control: keep it cool or lose control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/table-2723873_1920-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3546-4&quot;&gt;Active smoking and the risk of breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9807 alignright&quot; height=&quot;176&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/smoking.jpg&quot; width=&quot;176&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tobacco smoking is well known to cause lung cancer; however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3546-4&quot;&gt;Andersen et al.&lt;/a&gt;  explored the association between tobacco smoking and breast cancer in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baseline information and active tobacco smoking data of 28,731 female nurses from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/41/5/1241/706209&quot;&gt;Danish Nurse Cohort&lt;/a&gt; and their cancer diagnoses from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21775350&quot;&gt;Danish Cancer Register&lt;/a&gt; were examined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A positive association between active tobacco smoking and breast cancer incidence was found for women older than 44 years. In particular, women who smoked heavily and for a long time were at the most risk. There was almost a 30% increase in risk of breast cancer in smokers compared to never smokers. This study adds to the growing evidence that active smoking increases the risk of breast cancer, with increased smoking duration and smoking intensity adding to the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3808-1&quot;&gt;Incidental breast cancer and precursor lesions in autopsy studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A systematic review and meta-analysis published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3808-1&quot;&gt;Thomas and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; searched for autopsy studies using terms such as “breast neoplasms”, “autopsy” and “breast diseases”. The study aimed to provide an updated estimate of the prevalence pool of incidental breast cancer and precursor lesions. Although the incidence of breast cancer is thought to be increasing, women may decide not to undergo mammography screening as there is the chance of overdiagnosis, the diagnosis of cancers which would never declare themselves during the patient’s lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevalence pool of incidental breast cancer and precursor lesions was concluded to be large across women of all ages. A large pool of undetected cancer in-situ and atypical hyperplasia (which do not advance or do so very slowly) found in the study leads the authors to suggest caution for screening programs. Therefore, there is a need for breast cancer detection methods to be improved to prevent overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3347-9&quot;&gt;Anxiety and depression in working-age cancer survivors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors often suffer from higher levels of anxiety and depression than the general population. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3347-9&quot;&gt;Inhestern et al.&lt;/a&gt; specifically looked at anxiety and depression in working-age cancer survivors using self-reported questionnaires in cooperation with the regional cancer registries of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Cancer survivors between the age of 25 and 55 at the time of diagnosis were included in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9808 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/depression-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study concluded that around 40% of working-age cancer survivors can experience increased levels of anxiety and around 20% increased levels of depression. Higher anxiety was significantly associated with factors such as female gender, being younger in age, and poorer family functioning. Similarly, a number of factors heightened the chance of depression, for example, unemployment, no treatment being received and less social support being received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors at working-age may require psychological screening for a number of years after diagnosis so that cancer survivors at risk are identified. There may be a need for changes to survivorship programs for those at working-age to deal with the challenges they face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3580-2&quot;&gt;Self-reported sexual health in breast cancer survivors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9809 alignright&quot; height=&quot;230&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/survivors.jpg&quot; width=&quot;230&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we see a decrease in breast cancer mortality, there is a need for greater survivorship health care to improve quality of life. In particular, support for survivors with sexual health problems is needed. For example, breast cancer survivors face problems with body image, menopausal symptoms and satisfaction with partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3580-2&quot;&gt;Oberguggenberger and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; investigated sexual health in breast cancer survivors compared to women with no previous or current breast cancer using a patient-reported outcome assessment. This included the &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00435972&quot;&gt;Sexual Activity Questionnaire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0447.1983.tb09716.x/abstract;jsessionid=9D6831D2C9B77F09201C62F14FD86889.f01t03&quot;&gt;Hospital anxiety and depression scale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378512208002314?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;Menopause-specific quality of life questionnaire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study concluded overall breast cancer survivors reported worse sexual health than the female general population. An interesting finding was that there wasn’t an association between sexual health in breast cancer survivors and any treatment-related variables, this differs from previous studies and further research is needed. There is a need for health care providers to break the taboo and address sexual health as part of routine survivorship care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/sections/supportive-therapy-survivorship-and-psychosocial-oncology&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer&lt;/em&gt; launches new section!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer&lt;/em&gt; deeply recognises the prominence of the aforementioned topics, which are central for the field of cancer research. &lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer&lt;/em&gt; would like to further highlight and promote such topics and is thus launching a new section on “supportive therapy, survivorship and psychosocial oncology” under the trusted leadership of our new Consulting Editor Prof Daniele Santini, University Campus Bio-Medico, Italy.  We would encourage submissions in the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical symptoms associated with cancer and its treatment, including management of pain, fatigue, insomnia, nausea and other GI issues, appetite, anxiety, depression and stress management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orphan symptoms in cancer patients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimal nutrition and physical activity during and after treatment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healthy lifestyle choices including smoking cessation, weight management and coping styles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evidence-based counselling regarding botanicals, supplements and complementary therapies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sense of control and well-being despite the diagnosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emerging toxicities induced by new generation antineoplastic drugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emerging toxicities induced by new generation immunotherapies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, men and women differ psychologically in small but reliable ways, such as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20161011-do-men-and-women-really-have-different-personalities&quot;&gt;personality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/06/03/infants-show-a-preference-for-toys-that-match-their-gender-before-they-know-what-gender-is/&quot;&gt;interests&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2009/03/30/women-really-are-better-than-men-at-processing-faces/&quot;&gt;cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt;, but the basis of these differences is up for debate. Are they innate or due to how we’re socialised?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists look for traction on this question by studying sex differences in the brain, premised on the idea that these might contribute to the observed psychological differences. However, studying the brains of adults, or even teenagers, still leads to spinning wheels, because culturally produced differences will show up in the brain too. But how about one-month old infants, the subjects of &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00429-017-1600-2&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Brain Structure and Function&lt;/i&gt;?  Since birth, babies at this age have spent most of their time sleeping and suckling with limited eyesight, so profound socialisation effects aren’t going to be a factor. And yet, the new findings reveal that sex differences in a number of brain areas are already apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33129&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Wisconsin-Madison team led by Douglas Dean III recruited 149 expectant mothers who brought in their infants – 77 girls and 72 boys – for brain scanning one month after giving birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember doing MRI scans, and it was awfully noisy. So kudos to the infant neuroimaging community for developing a top-rate comfy environment for the little ones. They were popped into a vacuum immobilisation bag, surrounded with foam for comfort and sound insulation, and issued with ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones. These conditions allowed the scans to be performed while the infants slept, which was vital because even minor movements could have distorted the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dean’s team found that the boys’ brains were 8.3 per cent bigger, in line with the sex difference in brain volume found in adults and the few other available infant studies. Also as seen in adults, male brains had relatively more white matter (connecting tissue) and female brains more grey matter, relative to total brain size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of specific neural areas were larger in males, also relative to total brain volume, such as parts of the limbic system involved in emotions, including the amygdala, insula, thalamus and putamen. The researchers also found evidence for relatively larger hippocampi, an area involved in memory, which has more commonly been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818549/&quot;&gt;found to be larger in females&lt;/a&gt;, although not universally so. Meanwhile female brains were relatively larger in other limbic areas such as parts of the cingulate gyrus, caudate and parahippocampal gyrus, and they had a few white-matter structures that were relatively larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sex differences were smaller than has been observed in adults, which suggests that maturation continues this differentiation, likely through the high volume of sex steroid receptors in these brain areas. The alternative suggestion is that the subsequent differentiation is due to socialisation, but for the forces of socialisation to work along the same lines as pre-existing biological forces would suggest that socialisation is at most a feedback loop between biology and society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of brain areas that differed structurally between the sexes, but it would be irresponsible to draw any firm conclusions about what they might mean for function and behaviour. For instance, what could differences in overall insula size possibly mean psychologically when the area is associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insular_cortex&quot;&gt;“compassion and empathy, perception, motor control, self-awareness, cognitive functioning”, “interpersonal experience” and “psychopathology”&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason the new research is helpful is because it informs the interpretation of more focused studies that uncover psychological differences between the sexes. Imagine that researchers studying the treatment of anxiety find a sex-related difference in the stress response (as has happened in reality). If this difference is due entirely to sexist social structures that we’re already attempting to tear down, then the finding is not so important. But if that sex-linked difference in stress response is shown to be associated with sex-linked variation in amygdala size/structure, then the fact these anatomical differences exist so early – as shown by the current paper – makes it more plausible that the different ways men and women respond to stress is going to be hard to shake, even after social reform. Attempts to make society fairer are more likely to succeed with these facts in mind, rather than hoping they will go away.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h3&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-5226&quot; height=&quot;657&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/people-2567826_1280-1024x657.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interest in meditation and mindfulness as ways to reduce stress have exploded in popularity, and they’re great tools to have in your mental health toolkit. But what if these techniques don’t work for you? Here are some practical alternatives to switching off your stress response and finding peace of mind.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all stress is bad. We need an optimum level of stress to function effectively. Positive or beneficial stress is called ‘eustress’ and is defined by how you perceive that stressor. For example, what may be a negative threat to one person (e.g. sitting a test) may be perceived as a  positive challenge to another person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, excessive or chronic levels of stress or ‘distress’ negatively affect both our physical and mental health. Too much distress is associated with autoimmune diseases, migraines, obesity, muscle tension and backache, high cholesterol, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t avoid all sources of stress in our lives, nor would we want to. But we can develop healthier ways of responding. Learning to ‘switch off’ your stress response and ‘switch on’ your relaxation response is key to promoting mental health and physical wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people practise meditation to reduce psychological stress and stress-related health problems. Popular meditation techniques include transcendental meditation, which emphasises the use of a mantra; or mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), which emphasises training in present-focused awareness or ‘mindfulness’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is ample evidence to support MBSR as a stress-reduction tool. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1809754&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2014 systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine &lt;/em&gt;pooled data from 47 trials of the health effects of meditation programs on over 3,500 people. After carefully controlling for the placebo effect, the authors found that MBSR resulted in moderate improvements in anxiety, depression and pain. Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25818837&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2015 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; of 2668 healthy individuals in 29 different studies found large buffering effects of MBSR against stress, moderate effects on anxiety, depression, distress, and quality of life, and small effects on burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all its lauded benefits, meditation is not everyone’s cup of tea. Perhaps you don’t have the time or resources to attend an eight-week MBSR course, or you’re in need of immediate mental health first aid. Or, &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/does-meditation-stress-you-out-heres-what-i-do-instead/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;like me&lt;/a&gt;, you struggle with the practice thereby inadvertently&lt;em&gt; increasing&lt;/em&gt; your distress? The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au/docs/default-source/psychological-toolkit/relaxationtechniques.pdf?sfvrsn=10&quot;&gt;Black Dog Insitute&lt;/a&gt; recognises some people also encounter problems with ‘letting go’ and can become panicky when they try and relax. Because different stress management techniques appeal to different people, here are five simple evidence-based alternatives to meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify your triggers.&lt;/strong&gt; Make a list of events that leave you emotionally drained, with one or two ways to reduce the stress for each. When they occur, use them as an opportunity to practise your stress reduction techniques, then, keep notes on what works for next time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walk in nature.&lt;/strong&gt; Gentle repetitive exercise such as walking, swimming, and cycling are good to relieve stress and can be thought of like &lt;em&gt;meditation in motion&lt;/em&gt;. Exercise works most effectively to reduce stress when done away from urban settings in natural environments such as forests. Exposure to natural environments can also improve mood, reduce blood pressure and heart activity and improve your ability to concentrate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breathe in a box.&lt;/strong&gt; Slow, deep-breathing exercises evoke the relaxation response. One useful way to practice deep breathing is to use the ‘box breathing’ technique: &lt;em&gt;Breath in for four seconds. Hold your breath for four seconds. Exhale for four seconds. Then pause for four seconds before taking your next breath.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relax, muscle by muscle.&lt;/strong&gt; In progressive muscle relaxation, you tense up particular muscles and then relax them. Starting with the muscles in your legs and gradually work your way up your body. Tense each muscle group in turn. Make sure you can feel the tension, but not so much that you feel a great deal of pain. Keep the muscle tensed for about five seconds. Relax the muscles and keep them relaxed for approximately 10 seconds. It may be helpful to say something like “Relax” as you relax the muscle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to music.&lt;/strong&gt; Listening to music can have a tremendously relaxing effect on the mind and body. Slow, quiet classical music can slow the heart rate, lower blood pressure, and decrease levels of stress hormones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/shutterstock-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-017-0388-9&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain in amaXhosa women living with HIV/AIDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain is one of the most commonly reported symptoms in people living with HIV/AIDS. The prevalence of pain in women living with HIV/AIDS may differ from that of men as many chronic pain conditions are more prevalent in women than in men. This higher prevalence rate may be a reflection of cultural acceptance for women to report pain, but it may also be a consequence of differences in physiology between men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9832&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9832&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/parker-300x213.gif&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure taken from Parker, Jelsma and Stein, 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parker, Jelsma and Stein investigated pain prevalence, characteristics and management in 229 amaXhosa women living with HIV/AIDS. Almost 75% of the women interviewed reported pain, with the most frequently reported regions being the head/neck, followed by the abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study highlights that pain risk is not purely due to the fact that being female increases risk for developing pain. Research finds that socio-economic status has also been identified as a risk factor for pain. More than half of the women in the study were unemployed (66%), while other studies have identified low levels of education as increasing risk for pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain is a common problem for amaXhosa women living with HIV/AIDS, but routine pain assessments could aid the management of pain and the psychiatric comorbidities that accompany it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-017-0377-z&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning to live with osteoporosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis is a chronic condition that can lead to bone fractures and become debilitating if left untreated, but it is highly treatable in healthy individuals. A diagnosis of osteoporosis allows initiation of treatment before bone fractures occur, but the diagnosis itself can lead to difficulties for patients, who therefore may not follow the prescribed treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hansen &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; conducted a longitudinal qualitative study to explore patients’ experience of osteoporosis in the first year after diagnosis in order to understand where improvements in treatment could be helpful. The longitudinal nature of the study allowed for an in-depth understanding of the evolving process of learning to live with new life circumstances after a diagnosis of osteoporosis. They found that the decision to initiate, continue, or discontinue medication was a key theme of the women’s experiences. The results highlight the need for shared decision-making to increase compliance and improve outcomes for patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-017-0370-6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How hormone therapy affects quality of life and breast cancer risk after surgery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, a systematic review conducted by Siyam &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;investigated the effect of hormone therapy on quality of life and breast cancer risk after risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), a surgery involving the removal of the ovaries and Fallopian tubes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that several studies show the benefits of hormone therapy improving menopause-specific quality of life in symptomatic women who have gone through natural or surgical menopause. However, they were unable to draw conclusions relating to the safety of hormone therapy in relating to breast cancer risk, due to the lack of long-term studies available from which to draw conclusions. The authors urge the implementation of more well-designed randomized control trials in order to inform the use of hormone therapy post-RRSO, and in the interim, clinicians and patients must carefully discuss the potential benefits of hormone therapy in improving quality of life, in the context of the unknown risk of breast cancer in this population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-017-0479-7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Male attitudes and experiences towards conflict-related sexual violence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9834&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9834&quot; height=&quot;227&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/shutterstock2-300x227.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Image from Shutterstock, by MikeDotta&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the female survivors of sexual violence, the consequences of are not purely physical; many survivors face negative social outcomes, such as rejection by their family or community. Survivors of sexual violence in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (where this study took place) have stated that the stigma and shame they feel after rape can be more traumatic than the attack itself, due to these adverse societal results. Recent research has found that male relatives play a critical role in how the community responds to the survivor of this violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;investigated, through the use of focus groups, the sensitive questions surrounding spousal acceptance and rejection after an instance of sexual violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their results highlight the complexity of the topic, and how an interaction of factors affects the acceptance/rejection of a survivor of sexual violence. One the topic of “love and affection”, two contradictory views can be seen. The first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“As I was in deep love with her, my decision came easily to keep her”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; “Even if you love your wife, if you see her be raped, the love vanishes” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the drivers of rejection included the fear of sexually transmitted infections, the personal stigmatization and social isolation of men and the financial or logistical inability to provide adequate healthcare for survivors. Love and affection, financial contributions by the survivors, and children in the home were described as pathways to acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-017-0406-y&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications of male circumcision for women in Papua New Guinea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been found that male circumcision has the potential to reduce the risk of female-to-male transmission of HIV, and as such, is now being investigated as a possible HIV prevention technique in Papua New Guinea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a three-phase study conducted by Redman-MacLaren &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;the researchers first investigated women’s understanding of and experience of male circumcision. In the second part of the study, focus groups with women were employed to understand the processes women use to manage the outcomes of male circumcision. Lastly, participants helped identify local-level actions that could assist in HIV policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the focus group, the researchers found higher educational level was associated with women having more choice relating to whether a man’s circumcision would influence with whom they will have intimate relationships, as well as whether they will push for their sons to be circumcised. Regarding the latter, one woman interviewed said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; “I wasn’t aware of that, now that I’m aware, believe me, I’m going to have all my boys in my family, I will do it and I’m gonna do it. I will have to get them circumcised, that’s it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research found that women in Papua New Guinea are very knowledgeable on the topic of male circumcision, despite the idea of it being “men’s business.” However, women’s opinions regarding male circumcision is often related to a lack of safety, a consequence of a lack of opportunities for education and gender inequality in Papua New Guinea.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(18)30029-5/abstract&quot;&gt;Rouault et al&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianjarrett.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some researchers hope that focusing on the cognitive, neural, genetic and social processes that contribute to symptom dimensions – like anxiety-depression or social withdrawal – may be more fruitful than trying to understand the causes of different diagnostic categories, like “schizophrenia” or “major depression”. It’s in this vein that a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(18)30029-5/abstract&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; has used a simple perceptual task to investigate how judgment confidence, judgment accuracy and metacognition (judgment insight) are related to various trans-diagnostic symptom dimensions in the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33131&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across two experiments, Marion Rouault at UCL and her colleagues asked nearly a thousand participants recruited online to complete surveys about their experience of various psychiatric symptoms, from impulsivity to anxiety to schizotypy. The researchers looked for correlations between different symptoms and found that they grouped into three key dimensions: anxiety and depression, compulsive behaviour and intrusive thoughts, and social withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the participants all performed the same perceptual judgment many dozens of times: decide which of two adjacent boxes contained the most dots, and they rated their confidence in each decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they judged each pair of boxes, the participants weren’t given any feedback on their performance. However, in the second experiment, the task difficulty was continually adjusted for each participant so that their accuracy was kept constant and comparable to other participants (this was so the researchers could examine participants’ confidence and insight into their own judgment accuracy independent of their actual perceptual ability).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the participants’ experience of different mental health symptoms was not related to their accuracy at the perceptual task (unlike older age and lower IQ, which were both related to poorer accuracy, as you might expect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, however,  participants who scored higher on the anxiety-depression symptom dimension showed a consistent tendency towards being less confident in their judgments, and yet they showed more accurate metacognition – that is, their confidence more appropriately tracked their actual accuracy from one trial to the next. Perhaps in everyday life this blend of bias and insight might manifest as pessimism and harshly honest self-evaluation (which could contribute to problems in everyday life when you consider that sometimes a little over-confidence can give us the impetus to tackle important challenges).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, participants who scored higher on the “compulsive behaviour and intrusive thought” symptom dimension showed the opposite pattern – they were consistently more confident in their judgments, yet showed less accurate metacognition. This symptom dimension is shared by people who are diagnosed with schizophrenia, OCD and eating disorders, and one can imagine the mix of over-confidence and lack of insight playing out in everyday life in terms of jumping to conclusions and holding harmful convictions about the self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings reveal that shifts in metacognitive evaluation represent a specific and pervasive behavioral correlate of subclinical psychopathology,” the researchers said, adding that, “…The anxiety-depression and compulsive behaviour-intrusive thought dimensions show equal and opposite relationships between two key aspects of metacognition – confidence and meta-cognitive accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a methodological perspective, it’s notable that these patterns would have remained hidden if, rather than looking at symptom dimensions, the researchers had used participants’ scores on questionnaires tapping specific symptoms and diagnostic categories in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study should be considered preliminary. The sample was from the general public and the researchers relied on the participants’ reports of their own symptoms. The findings might be different with clinical samples. It also remains to be seen if the symptom-related patterns of confidence and insight uncovered here would apply to other contexts beyond the specific perceptual task that was used. The researchers predict they will: “Recent evidence points towards metacognition relying in part on domain-general resources, suggesting that the findings from the current study are likely to generalise to other scenarios,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(18)30029-5/abstract&quot;&gt;Psychiatric symptom dimensions are associated with dissociable shifts in metacognition but not task performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are words written by Dyche Mullins and Peter Walter, in 2016. Walter is one of this year’s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2017/12/409186/biochemist-peter-walter-receives-2018-breakthrough-prize-life-sciences&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Breakthrough Prize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in Life Sciences &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/01/life-science-breakthrough-prize-2018/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;recipients&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;and a leader in the scientific community not only for his scientific investigations but also for his continuous dedication to mentoring and teaching younger scientists, and for taking a progressive but circumspect stand on issues that impact the quality of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-biology/2016/12/09/non-model-models-pre-print-servers-fruit-translational-tree/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;scientific life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Walter has strong opinions related to impact factors and Open Access; he remains open minded regarding preprints. His valuable and modest insights are below, with minimal editing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS: &lt;/strong&gt;Which of your &lt;a href=&quot;http://plos.io/Walter_BTP2018&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS articles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were most impactful for your work related to the prize, and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walter:&lt;/strong&gt; The Brickner and Walter paper [“&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020342&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gene Recruitment of the Activated &lt;em&gt;INO1&lt;/em&gt; Locus to the Nuclear Membrane&lt;/a&gt;”] stands out, in my view, as this story organically grew out of our ongoing work on the unfolded protein response, yet opened an entirely new field: that the physical location of a genetic locus inside the nucleus can be dynamic and affect gene regulation. This paper also served to seed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.molbiosci.northwestern.edu/people/core-faculty/jason-brickner.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jason Brickner’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; independent career: Shortly after this publication, he was recruited to Northwestern University. Since then, his lab has vastly expanded upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050081&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this topic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and he is now internationally recognized as one of the very leaders of cell biological mechanisms that control &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001524&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;transcriptional memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have a personal favorite among your PLOS publications? Perhaps one that was either controversial or that sparked scientific debate/conversation at time of publication?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walter:&lt;/strong&gt; The Pincus et al. paper [“&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000415&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BiP Binding to the ER-Stress Sensor Ire1 Tunes the Homeostatic Behavior of the Unfolded Protein Response&lt;/a&gt;”] is one of my all-time favorites: It demonstrates the power of computational modeling for generating new hypotheses and then experimentally testing them. In this case, modeling suggested experiments that we would not have thought of otherwise, and the results showed beyond reasonable doubt that BiP dissociation from the ER-resident stress sensor Ire1 is not the regulatory switch that activates the UPR. The work inspired rethinking, and it is now clear that in both, yeast and metazoans, unfolded proteins per se are agonists that bind directly to the stress sensors Ire1 (and PERK). Despite the seminal insights provided in this publication, the field remains attached to the notion that BiP dissociation is causal for Ire1 activation—providing an important insight into the surprisingly inflexible thinking of established scientists (including myself, at times…).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS:&lt;/strong&gt; In your experience speaking with the public or non-scientists in general, what concept(s) about the unfolded protein response pathway do they typically find most interesting or resonates strongly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walter:&lt;/strong&gt; Trained as a chemist, I personally cherish the many unorthodox molecular mechanisms by which the unfolded protein response regulates ER [endoplasmic reticulum] homeostasis. However, beauty at a molecular scale is mostly appreciated by aficionados and only rarely resonates with the public and non-scientists. We are now in a most fortunate era where our work tangibly links to a broad spectrum of diseases, including cancer and neurodegeneration, where our knowledge has become foundational to the exploration of new treatment strategies. &lt;strong&gt;As such, our work provides a wonderful platform on which to demonstrate the power and value to society of curiosity-driven research in which we seek understanding of how healthy cells work in disease-agnostic approaches and then use that knowledge to learn what goes wrong in disease and how to fix it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS:&lt;/strong&gt; Our readers span the range of career stages. What is your opinion of the value or challenge to publishing in Open Access journals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walter:&lt;/strong&gt; The challenge for the next generation of researchers is to break out of the stranglehold that the for-profit publishing industry has put on our community. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/06/impact-factor-genie-back-in-the-box/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;misguided emphasis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on abstruse metrics, e.g., impact factor, in addition to the poorly transparent review procedures by our “vanity journals” and their hand-me-down cousins distort our most fundamental values. My colleagues and I have clearly laid out our views on this topic [in addition to the ASCB Newsletter referenced in the opening quote see the commentary co-authored with Martin Raff and Alexander Johnson, entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5885/36.1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Painful Publishing&lt;/a&gt;”].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as with scientific models, old patterns are hard to break. We need our young scientists to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/thestudentblog/2017/09/01/bullied-into-going-national-early-career-researchers-are-taking-initiative/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;recapture control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The myth that one can only get a job/grant/promotion with [high impact factor journal] papers has been debunked internationally (e.g., Jason Brickner and &lt;a href=&quot;http://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/english/faculty/faculty/4161.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liang Ge in China&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The challenge ahead is to spread the word and make sure that no young scientist who made an important discovery will ever be held back by the name of the journal where &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/04/ecrs-and-forbes-30-under-30/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ground breaking findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Open-access and publishing (to “make public”) are synonymous in my view, and scientist-run non-profit open-access journals that manage to deliver consistently customer-friendly, transparent, and constructive reviews and timely feedback are destined to lead the movement.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, have you or collaborator ever posted a preprint? If not, would you consider doing so, and why/why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walter:&lt;/strong&gt; To date, we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/24/222257&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;posted&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/04/239830&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;preprints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—I consider them experiments with the new forum. For now, I remain agnostic to the process. Science is moving fast enough for my taste (if not too fast sometimes), and I remain unsure whether an invitation to put un-reviewed stories out there will be that beneficial overall. Many things will need to be worked out: Does a preprint establish priority for a discovery? How will “better-first-and-sloppy-than-second-and-who-cares” science be regarded by the community? How will we deal with predatory scientists who appropriate ideas and results from our students or postdocs and then race to scoop them? Also, personally, I read most papers only once, and it is the first impression that sticks. The concept of looking at evolving versions rather than a final, best-as-can-be product is rather vulnerable in my opinion. We’ll see; I remain open-minded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Neuronal simulation software packages such as GENESIS and NEURON have been available for more than 25 years. However, the last 5 years have seen a rapid growth of a variety of openly available resources for neuronal modelling, with a particular focus on open access to software, models and simulation and experimental data. I will give an overview of resources that are currently available and present a selection of simulators for neuronal modelling at different levels of detail, computational and experimental databases, tools for the generation and analysis of neuronal morphologies and interoperability frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ego depletion is the notion that willpower is a fuel that gets burned away by effort, and once it burns low we lose our focus and bow to our immediate desires. However, this once dominant theory has recently come into question, thanks in part to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-12718-004&quot;&gt;large-scale replication&lt;/a&gt; that failed to find an ego-depletion effect and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4115664/&quot;&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; that argued that the size of the effect is minimal. Complicating the picture, other &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/12/14/strongest-evidence-yet-for-ego-depletion-the-idea-that-self-control-is-a-limited-resource/&quot;&gt;recent findings&lt;/a&gt; have provided a strong demonstration of the effect. But now researchers from Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz have released &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/pvefx/&quot;&gt;a pre-print at PsyArxiv&lt;/a&gt; in which they suggest the debates over the size of the ego-depletion effect are missing the point because when you look over the long-term, ego depletion becomes meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33123&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team, led by Mario Wenzel, built experiments around the classic ego-depletion design: some participants performed an initial mentally demanding task designed to make them ego-depleted whereas others acted as controls and performed a low-effort version. Next, all participants performed a second mentally demanding task. Poorer performance on this second task by the ego-depleted group, as compared with the controls, was taken as evidence of ego depletion. However, unlike in most previous research, Wenzel and his colleagues had their participants repeat these pairs of tasks several times, to see if any effects of ego depletion would accumulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first experiment, the researchers asked their participants to start by completing a difficult or easy version of the Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT). This involved quickly responding to simple stimuli on a computer screen by pressing the button corresponding to the odd one out. The 18 student participants in the control group started with a dead easy version that involved displays like “xx1” with an obvious odd-one-out, whereas the 46 students in the ego-depletion condition completed a harder version that involved responding to whichever digit was the odd-one-out based purely on its colour, while ignoring the uniqueness or not of its numerical value (such as the red “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” in arrays like “&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;42”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, all the participants completed the same second task, which was another colour version of the MSIT – only this time colours had to be ignored entirely, just focusing on the odd number out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once participants had done the initial and second tasks, they started again, completing another pair of MSIT tasks – and then repeated this in a third “block” of tasks, then again in a fourth. If willpower was being used up by these tasks, you would expect performance to deteriorate even more in the later blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if anything, the results were the other way around. Wenzel’s team found that the ego-depletion effect was largest in the first block and then diminished (across the four blocks, in statistical terms the effect sizes were very small, from .065 to .001, and mostly non-significant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a second experiment with 93 students, the researchers pushed the time horizon further, to see if the fuel needle would finally hit empty. This time there were 12 “blocks” involving various pairs of tasks, with the second task always the classic Stroop test (in which participants must identify the font colour of colour-denoting words, such as “red” written in blue ink). For instance, participants might do one of the MSITs paired with the the Stroop, then a version of the &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:http%25253A//www.impulsivity.org/measurement/cued_Go_NoGo&quot;&gt;Go-No-Go task&lt;/a&gt; paired with the Stroop, then a copying task paired with the Stroop, and so on. When participants were being hit with the harder versions of the initial tasks, how did their Stroop performance fare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants agreed (as they did in the first experiment) that the hard versions of the preliminary tasks required more self-control. But again, over the course of the blocks, any evidence of ego depletion, in terms of greater declining performance among the participants completing the harder initial tasks, turned out to be small and statistically non-significant – this despite the fact that mild ego depletion often did show up during the very first block. In other words, the ego-depletion effect did the opposite of what we might expect – if anything, participants’ willpower replenished over time (a finding that’s similar to the recently documented example of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/12/reverse-ego-depletion-people-in-india-find-mental-effort-energising/&quot;&gt;reverse ego depletion&lt;/a&gt; in India).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers conceded that part of the explanation may be an effect of practice (even in the second experiment that used a mix of tasks to counteract this possibility). Maybe tackling a mix of effortful tasks that occasionally repeat is something you ease into after a bit. But this doesn’t really let ego depletion off the hook: if it only adds up to anything in the narrow window between starting a task and getting to grips with it, it can’t be all that important – and would seem to have little bearing on the domains that it has been associated with, such as keeping up the willpower to get in shape, pass your finals, or stay off the cigarettes. In this pre-print paper, which has been submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, the researchers recommend that we focus a little more attention on the mechanisms that matter for life-sized timespans, and less on laboratory-induced blips in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/pvefx/&quot;&gt;Practice conquers it all: Even if the ego depletion effect is genuine, it may not be relevant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/Cancer-cells-red_iStock-Photoresized-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review articles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the highlights in 2017 was a review written by one of our own Consulting Editors, Prof. Steve Povoski: ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3444-9&quot;&gt;A comprehensive overview on the surgical management of secondary lymphedema of the upper and lower extremities related to prior oncologic therapies&lt;/a&gt;’. Oncologic therapies including surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy may lead to secondary lymphedema, a major factor in long term morbidity in cancer sufferers. Lymphodema arises from a collection of ‘protein rich extracellular fluid within the interstitial compartment of tissues that arises from an imbalance of lymph production and lymph transport to the systemic circulation’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oncologic therapies for Gynaecologic, urologic cancers, melanoma and lymphoma are mostly associated with lymphedema of the lower extremities, those for breast cancer with the upper extremities. This is a side effect which is currently being addressed by both surgical and non-surgical techniques. Further research aims to find solutions for lymphedema which is understood to affect 90 million people worldwide from a variety of causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific gene involvement in cancers &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3134-7&quot;&gt;Testis specific Y-like 5: gene expression, methylation and implications for drug sensitivity in prostate carcinoma&lt;/a&gt; was published in February and described Testis specific Y-like 5 (TSPYL5), a putative tumor suppressor gene, belonging to the nucleosome assembly protein family. The gene is located at 8Q22.1 though its exact role in prostate cancer disease is not fully defined. The study investigated gene expression and methylation levels of TSPYL5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Methylation of this gene in tumor tissues correlated inversely with its mRNA and protein expression.’ The authors proposed that this gene could be an indicator of more advanced prostate cancer as its gene product is seen in reduced amounts in tumors with high &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.org/treatment/understanding-your-diagnosis/tests/understanding-your-pathology-report/prostate-pathology/prostate-cancer-pathology.html&quot;&gt;Gleason Scores&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immunotherapy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9801 alignright&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/Cancer-cell-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to use the immune system for treatment and cure of disease is a dream of many physicians. In December, the authors of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3854-8&quot;&gt;Expitope 2.0: a tool to assess immunotherapeutic antigens for their potential cross-reactivity against naturally expressed proteins in human tissues&lt;/a&gt; published a new and improved version of their tool, which aims to help immunotherapy develop. This web tool provides prediction of cross reactivity of T cell epitopes, ‘based on experimental protein abundance and expression data obtained from a growing number of publicly available databases.’ See &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3854-8#Sec3&quot;&gt;Table 1 included here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Frishman group shows the variability of cross reactivity to presented peptides appears to depend on different health states. Cross reactivity is approximately 5-fold higher in individuals with cancer than those of good health. The similarity of presented peptides to self –antigens ‘is an obstacle for disease elimination both for the organism itself and for immunotherapy.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New compounds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper by &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3085-z&quot;&gt;Dyshlovoy et al.&lt;/a&gt; illustrates well the diversity of topics covered in &lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer. &lt;/em&gt;Urothelial cancers are hard to treat but these authors discovered that&lt;em&gt; ‘&lt;/em&gt;The marine triterpene glycoside frondoside A induces p53-independent apoptosis and inhibits autophagy in urothelial carcinoma cells’. The compound frondoside A (FrA), isolated from the sea cucumber Cucumaria frondosa induces apoptosis without the need for active caspases and p53; inhibits pro-survival autophagy; and demonstrates increased activity when used in combination with classical cytotoxic agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biomarker development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final article included here has been very popular. Having  an Altmetric attention score of 425, ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3375-5&quot;&gt;Calretinin as a blood-based biomarker for mesothelioma’&lt;/a&gt; was published in May 2017. The authors used a case-control design to ask their specific questions regarding the usefulness of calretinin as a biomarker for malignant mesothelioma (MM) which is a deadly cancer caused by exposure to asbestos. They concluded that calretinin has a similar performance in detecting MM (except the sarcomoid subtype) as Mesothelin, the gold standard. They propose that Calretinin be added to a panel of biomarkers with mesothelin for validation of these markers in a prospective cohort study. The hopes would be that a panel of biomarkers would be developed and used in surveillance programmes of workers with former exposure to asbestos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for papers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to announce that &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Cancer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Biotechnology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have launched a cross-journal thematic series. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/collections/call-for-papers-car-immunotherapy&quot;&gt;Call for papers&lt;/a&gt; introduces Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies, already important in haematological malignancies and hoped to become standard therapies in the clinic. The series is entitled ’The Advances of CAR Immunotherapy within Oncology Clinics’ and is accepting submissions until the end of June 2018. The three guest editors are: Profs Marko Radic, Djordje Atanackovic and Tim Luetkens.&lt;/p&gt;

Twelve years! During this time, I've managed to remain a mysterious pseudonym to almost everyone. Very few people know who I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a lot has changed since then. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://cos.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Center for Open Science&quot;&gt;Open Science&lt;/a&gt; movement, the rise of multiple platforms for critique, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691612465253&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Editors' Introduction to the Special Section on Replicability in Psychological Science: A Crisis of Confidence?&quot;&gt;Replication Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in social psychology, the emergence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/9zubbn9fyi1xjcu/Fiske%20presidential%20guest%20column_APS%20Observer_copy-edited.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Susan Fiske APS presidential guest column&quot;&gt;methodological terrorists, data police, and destructo-critics&lt;/a&gt;. Assertive psychologists and statisticians with large social media presences have openly criticized flawed studies using much harsher language than I do. Using their own names. It's hard to stay relevant... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a pseudonym now seems quaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most famous neuro-pseudonym of all, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Neuroskeptic&lt;/a&gt;, interviewed me 2 years ago in a post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/scicomm/2016/03/21/pseudonyms-in-science-neuroskeptic-speaks-to-neurocritic-dr-primestein-and-neurobonkers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Pseudonyms in Science: Neuroskeptic speaks to Neurocritic, Dr Primestein and Neurobonkers&quot;&gt;Pseudonyms in Science&lt;/a&gt;. He asked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;What led you to choose to blog under a pseudonym?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My answer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;It was for exactly the same reason that reviewers of papers and grants are anonymous: it gives you the ability to provide an honest critique without fear of retaliation. If peer review ever becomes completely open and transparent, then I’d have no need for a pseudonym any more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an ideal world, reviewers should be identified and held accountable for what they write. Then shoddy reviews and nasty comments would (presumably) become less common. We’ve all seen anonymous reviews that are incredibly insulting, mean, and unprofessional. So it’s hypocritical to say that bloggers are cowardly for hiding under pseudonyms, while staunchly upholding the institution of anonymous peer review. ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neuroskeptic also interviewed &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurobonkers.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Simon Oxenham&quot;&gt;Neurobonkers&lt;/a&gt; (who went public) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psi-chology.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Primestein&lt;/a&gt; (who has not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have you ever been tempted to drop the pseudonym and use your real name? What do you think would happen (positive and negative if you did?)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My answer: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to drop the pseudonym, it might be good (and bad) for my career as a neuroscientist. I could finally take credit for my writing, but then I’d have to take all the blame too! But overall, it’s likely that less would happen than I currently imagine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{At this point, most people probably don't care who I am.}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what has changed? Have I left the field? No. But some serious and tragic life events have rendered my anonymity irrelevant. I just don't care any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In September, my closest childhood friend died from cancer (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/09/survival-and-grief.html&quot;&gt;Survival and Grief&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-adI_yfXIYgo/Wm1CWFvZlPI/AAAAAAAAMbI/ITTpau4x-TkoDyD042Vj-iunx7nucqyjwCLcBGAs/s1600/carrowinds.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;244&quot; data-original-width=&quot;227&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-adI_yfXIYgo/Wm1CWFvZlPI/AAAAAAAAMbI/ITTpau4x-TkoDyD042Vj-iunx7nucqyjwCLcBGAs/s1600/carrowinds.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;I'm on the right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a month later, my wife was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. My sadness and depression and anxiety over this is beyond words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't want to go into any more detail right now, but I'd like to show you who we are. We met via our blogs in 2006. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6iDU_U2y7OI/Wm1F9UU8b5I/AAAAAAAAMbU/dYppVTRd_64fs477cCcv1LjaNT8lewIIwCLcBGAs/s1600/snowshoeing%2B2016.JPG&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;960&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6iDU_U2y7OI/Wm1F9UU8b5I/AAAAAAAAMbU/dYppVTRd_64fs477cCcv1LjaNT8lewIIwCLcBGAs/s320/snowshoeing%2B2016.JPG&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Snowshoeing on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mtseymour.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;North Vancouver, BC&quot;&gt;Mt.

 &quot;Social priming&quot; has recently been one of the most controversial topics in psychological science. With failures to replicate proliferating, the field has been called a train-wreck. But what exactly is it?





Here's how I defined social priming in a 2016 post:
“Social priming” has been the punching-bag of psychology for the past few years.

The term “social priming” refers to the idea that subtle cues can exert large, unconscious influences on human behaviour. The classic example of a</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-9814 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/fig-1-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Previous studies have investigated the life expectancy of elite athletes compared to that of the general population. These studies have found that, while the majority of elite athletes to live longer than the general public, this is not the case in all sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study by Lee-Heidenreich and colleagues attempted to identify any variations in life expectancy within athletics events. They analyzed the death dates of the top 20 males and females in various track and field athletics events such as: the Olympic high jump, discus, marathon and 100m sprint from the years 1928–1948. Their results revealed that life expectancy did vary by event, with high-jumpers and marathon runners living longer than discus throwers and sprinters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Olympic medalists were found to have a higher life expectancy than the general population regardless of country, whereas 100m runners did not live longer than the general population. The authors suggest that future studies are needed to determine if there are differences in cause-specific mortality (e.g. cardiovascular disease) between different types of elite athletes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9815&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/fig-2-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;There are many ways that an athlete can recover after exercise, but what methods are the most popular? A study carried out by Fiona Crowther and colleagues from James Cook University in Australia surveyed the preferred recovery methods of 331 athletes from levels ranging from local to international. They found that all international athletes used massage as a form of recovery, whereas the most popular method of recovery overall was stretching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the majority of participants did undertake recovery techniques, these did not always align with scientific evidence on the most efficient recovery technique. Consequently, it is important that athletes and coaching staff are informed about the effects of different techniques to ensure recovery strategies are selected and implemented for the correct reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcsportsscimedrehabil.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13102-017-0076-y&quot;&gt;The influence of a Healthy Welcoming Environment on participation in club sport by adolescent girls: a longitudinal study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9817&quot; height=&quot;214&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/fig-4-300x214.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Currently, four out of five adolescents do not achieve the recommended levels of physical activity per day, particularly adolescent girls, who are significantly less active than their male counterparts. Why is this? And how do you increase adolescent participation in sport?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try and address these questions, Casey and co-workers investigated the role that a healthy welcoming environment had on the participation in sports clubs of two groups of secondary school girls. They collected information on the sports membership of female students in years 7 (aged 11-13 years) and 11 (aged 16-18 years) and recorded the factors that influenced their decision to take part in sport. The results indicated that 80% of participants rated the welcoming atmosphere of the club (knowing someone at the club/friendliness of the coach) as an important factor, whereas the healthy environment of the club was found to be significantly less important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some welcoming strategies suggested by the authors include: a designated club ambassador who is responsible for meeting new members, a club induction, club events, and linking new members with a peer mentor. Consequently sporting bodies should consider prioritizing the social environment within sports clubs in order to increase sports participation in adolescent girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcsportsscimedrehabil.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13102-017-0084-y&quot;&gt;Are we missing opportunities? Physiotherapy and physical activity promotion: a cross-sectional survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9820&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/fig-7-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Physiotherapists are in an ideal position to promote physical activity (PA); however, there is little evidence that this occurs. To investigate this, Nicole Freene, Sophie Cools and Bernie Bissett from the University of Canberra (Australia) surveyed a total of 257 Australian physiotherapists to determine how frequently they promoted PA and to assess their knowledge of the Australian physical activity and sedentary behavior (PASB) guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the majority of participants agreed that the promotion of PA was part of their role, the results found that only half of the participants promoted PA beyond therapeutic exercise to 10 or more patients per month. Furthermore, male physiotherapists were significantly more likely to promote PA than female physiotherapists. The study also found that the participants generally had a poor knowledge of the Australian (PASB) guidelines, with only a small percentage being able to accurately state all four components of the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of these findings, it is apparent that that further education on the Australian PASB guidelines may allow physiotherapists to promote PA more successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcsportsscimedrehabil.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13102-017-0075-z&quot;&gt;Are there two forms of isometric muscle action? Results of the experimental study support a distinction between a holding and a pushing isometric muscle function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9819&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/fig-5-300x281.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current research regarding isometric (static) muscle action is limited, but it has been suggested that two forms of isometric action could exist: (i) holding isometric muscle action (HIMA), where an applied external load is held in a static position, and (ii) pushing isometric muscle action (PIMA), where the subject pushes against or pulls at a resistance that equals the force exerted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, Laura Schaefer and Frank Bittmann (University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany) measured various parameters in the triceps brachii muscle of 10 healthy participants while they performed both a pushing and a holding exercise. Their study found a variation between the two muscle actions in regards to force endurance, the power at particular frequencies and time to exhaustion (as HIMA was found to cause the muscle to exhaust more rapidly than PIMA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible explanation for this variation is that the neuronal control strategies and muscle physiological aspects in HIMA more closely resemble an eccentric muscle action, while PIMA could be more similar to a concentric muscle action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results partially support the theory that there are two types of isometric muscle action; however, further research is required regarding the cause of variation between the two muscle actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcsportsscimedrehabil.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13102-017-0079-8&quot;&gt;Hormonal aspects of overtraining syndrome: a systematic review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9821&quot; height=&quot;177&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/fig-6-300x177.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Some people may believe that intense exercising every day is the best way to get fit; however, excessive training and insufficient recovery in sport can lead to overtraining syndrome (OTS). OTS causes acute feelings of fatigue and decreased performance, but can be hard to diagnose as it can be triggered by a variety of factors including hormonal, metabolic and immune dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using PRISMA guidelines, Cadegiani and Kater performed a systematic review to investigate the hormonal aspects of OTS as a potential diagnostic tool. They found that basal levels of hormones were not a good indicator of overtraining, whereas growth hormone (GH) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) responses were blunted during stimulation tests undertaken by the affected individuals. Further research is required, but the study indicates that GH and ACTH responses may be useful predictors in the diagnosis of OTS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are examples of extremely intelligent individuals with strong religious convictions. But various studies have found that, on average, belief in God is associated with &lt;a href=&quot;http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/The-Relation-Between-Intelligence-and-Religiosity-A-Meta-Analysis-and-Some-Proposed-Explanations.pdf&quot;&gt;lower scores on IQ tests&lt;/a&gt;. “It is well established that religiosity correlates inversely with intelligence,” note Richard Daws and Adam Hampshire at Imperial College London, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02191/full&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, which seeks to explore why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a question with some urgency – the proportion of people &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projections-2010-2050/&quot;&gt;with a religious belief is growing&lt;/a&gt;: by 2050, if current trends continue, people who say they are not religious will make up only 13 per cent of the global population. Based on the low-IQ-religiosity link, it could be argued that humanity is on course to become collectively less smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33084&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One suggestion is that perhaps religious people tend to rely more on intuition. So, rather than having impaired general intelligence, they might be comparatively poor only on tasks in which intuition and logic come into conflict – and this might explain the lower overall IQ test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate, Daws and Hampshire surveyed more than 63,000 people online, and had them complete a 30-minute set of 12 cognitive tasks that measured planning, reasoning, attention and working memory. The participants also indicated whether they were religious, agnostic or atheist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As predicted, the atheists performed better overall than the religious participants, even after controlling for demographic factors like age and education. Agnostics tended to place between atheists and believers on all tasks. In fact, strength of religious conviction correlated with poorer cognitive performance. However, while the religious respondents performed worse overall on tasks that required reasoning, there were only very small differences in working memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, some of the reasoning tasks, such as an extra-hard version of the Stroop Task known as “colour-word remapping”, had been designed to create maximum conflict between an intuitive response and a logical one, and the biggest group differences emerged on these tasks, consistent with the idea that religious people rely more on their intuition. In contrast, for a complex reasoning task – “deductive reasoning” – for which there were no obviously intuitive answers, there was much less of a group difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daws and Hampshire concluded: “These findings provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that the religiosity effect relates to conflict [between reasoning and intuition] as opposed to reasoning ability or intelligence more generally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, as this work suggests, religious belief predisposes people to rely more heavily on intuition in decision-making – and the stronger their belief, the more pronounced the impact – how much of a difference does this make to actual achievement in the real world? At the moment, there’s no data on this. But in theory, perhaps cognitive training could allow religious people to maintain their beliefs without over-relying on intuition when it conflicts with logic in day to day decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02191/full&quot;&gt;The Negative Relationship between Reasoning and Religiosity Is Underpinned by a Bias for Intuitive Responses Specifically When Intuition and Logic Are in Conflict&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
