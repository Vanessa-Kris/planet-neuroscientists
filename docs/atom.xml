 &lt;p&gt;On Twitter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RichieHakim/status/1363545448317878282&quot;&gt;Richie Hakim asked&lt;/a&gt; whether the toolbox Cascade for spike inference (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;) induces temporal dispersion of the predicted spiking activity compared to ground truth. This kind of temporal dispersion had been observed in a study from last year (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008198&quot;&gt;Wei et al., PLoS Comp Biol, 2020&lt;/a&gt;; also discussed in a previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/2020/09/14/discrepancies-between-calcium-imaging-and-extracellular-ephys-recordings/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;), suggesting that analyses based on raw or deconvolved calcium imaging data might falsely suggest continuous sequences of neuronal activations, while the true activity patterns are coming in discrete bouts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To approach this question, I used one of our 27 ground truth datasets (the one recorded for the original GCaMP6f paper). From all recordings in this data set, I detected events that exceeded a certain ground truth spike rate. Next, I assigned these extracted events in 3 groups and systematically shifted the detected event of groups 1 and 3 by 0.5 seconds forth and back. Note that this is a short shift compared to the timescale investigated by the Wei et al. paper. This is how the ground truth looks like. It is clearly not a continuous sequence of activations:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6749&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6749&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;noise2_1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_1.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_1.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_1.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1329,561&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/noise2_1/&quot; height=&quot;196&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_1.png?w=1024&quot; width=&quot;465&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether the three-bout pattern would result in a continuous sequence after spike inference, I just used the dF/F recordings associated with above ground truth recordings and Cascade’s global model for excitatory neurons (a pretrained network that is available with the toolbox), I infered the spike rates. There is indeed some dispersion due to the difficulty to infer spike rates from noisy data. But the three bouts are very clearly visible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6751&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6751&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;noise2_2&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_2.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_2.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_2.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1336,569&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/noise2_2/&quot; height=&quot;204&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_2.png?w=1024&quot; width=&quot;478&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is even more apparent when plotting the average spike rate across neurons:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6757&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6757&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;noise2_3-1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_3-1.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_3-1.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_3-1.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1340,568&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/noise2_3-1/&quot; height=&quot;212&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise2_3-1.png?w=1024&quot; width=&quot;502&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it can be concluded that there are conditions and existing datasets where discrete activity bouts can be clearly distinguished from sequential activations based on spike rates inferred with Cascade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This analysis was performed on neurons at a standardized noise level of 2% Hz&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2&quot;&gt;preprint &lt;/a&gt;for a proper definition of the standardized noise level). This is a typical and very decent noise level for population calcium imaging. However, if we perform the same analysis on the same data set but with a relatively high noise level of 8% Hz&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, the resulting predictions are indeed much more dispersed, since the dF/F patterns are too noisy to make more precise predictions. The average spike rate still shows three peaks, but they are only riding on top of a more broadly distributed, seemingly persistent increase of the spike rate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6758&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6758&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;noise8-1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise8-1.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise8-1.png?w=224&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise8-1.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1317,1765&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/noise8-1/&quot; height=&quot;671&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/noise8-1.png?w=764&quot; width=&quot;502&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to play around with this analysis with different noise levels or different data sets, you do not need to install anything. You can just, within less than 5 minutes, run &lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/github/PTRRupprecht/Calcium_imaging_and_temporal_dispersion/blob/main/Temporal_dispersion_of_activity_from_deconvolved_calcium_imaging.ipynb&quot;&gt;this Colaboratory Notebook&lt;/a&gt; in your browser and reproduce the above results.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This is what it looks like to land on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NASA’s Perseverance rover took this video on February 18 as a jetpack lowered it onto the Red Planet’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It gives me goosebumps every time I see it,” said engineer David Gruel of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., at a news briefing on February 22.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The movie begins with the rover’s parachute opening above it as the rover and its landing gear enter the Martian atmosphere. Seconds later, a camera on the rover’s underside shows the heat shield falling toward the ground. If you look carefully, you can see one of the springs that pushed the heat shield off the rover came loose, said NASA engineer Allen Chen, the rover’s entry, descent and landing lead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;NASA’s Perseverance rover captured video of its own landing using a set of cameras on the back of the entry vehicle, the sky crane and the rover itself.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s no danger to the spacecraft here, but it’s something we didn’t expect, and wouldn’t have seen” without the videos, he said.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The rover filmed the ground coming closer and closer, getting glimpses of a river delta, craters, ripples and fractured terrain. Cameras on the top and bottom of the rover captured clouds of dust billowing as the rover’s jetpack, the sky crane, lowered it down to the ground on three cables. A camera on the sky crane showed the rover swinging slightly as it descended. Finally, the sky crane disconnected the cables and flew away, leaving Perseverance to begin its mission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to express how emotional it was and how exciting it was to everybody” to see the movie for the first time, said deputy project manager Matt Wallace. “Every time we got something, people were overjoyed, giddy. They were like kids in a candy store.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The movie looks so much like animations of the sky crane landing technique that NASA had released in the past that it almost doesn’t look real, says imaging scientist Justin Maki. “I can attest to, it’s real,” he says. “It’s stunning and it’s real.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Listen to the wind blow on Mars&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perseverance carries a microphone to record the sounds of the Martian surface. The first recording included a gust of wind. Rover engineers say they also hope to hear the wheels crunch as the rover drives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Wind on Mars&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-audio&quot;&gt;&lt;audio controls=&quot;controls&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/022220_lg_mars_wind.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rover also captured audio from the surface of the Red Planet for the first time, including a gust of Martian wind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perseverance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down&quot;&gt;landed in an ancient lakebed called Jezero crater&lt;/a&gt;, about two kilometers from what looks like an ancient river delta feeding into the crater (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/18/21&lt;/em&gt;). The rover’s primary mission is to search for signs of past life and to cache rock samples for a future mission to return to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first images Perseverance sent back from Mars showed its wheels on a flat expanse. The ground is strewn with rocks that are shot through with holes, said deputy project scientist Katie Stack Morgan in a news briefing on February 19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Depending on the origins of the rocks, these holes could mean different things,” she said. The science team thinks the holes could be from gases escaping volcanic rock as lava cooled, or from fluid moving through the rock and dissolving it away. “Both would be equally exciting for the team.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title type="html" xml:lang="en-US">The first human genetic blueprint just turned 20. What’s next?</title>
		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-human-genome-project-20th-anniversary-future"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;As the master blueprint for building humans turns 20, researchers are both celebrating the landmark achievement and looking for ways to bolster its shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Human Genome Project — which built the blueprint, called the human reference genome — has changed the way medical research is conducted, says Ting Wang, a geneticist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. “It’s highly, highly valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, before the project, drugs were developed by serendipity, but having the master blueprint led to the development of therapies that could specifically target certain biological processes. As a result, more than 2,000 drugs aimed at specific human genes or proteins have been approved. The reference genome has also made it possible to untangle complicated networks involved &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/team-releases-sequel-human-genome&quot;&gt;in regulating gene activity&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/5/12&lt;/em&gt;) and learn more about how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/catalog-dna-modifications-produces-surprises&quot;&gt;chemical modifications to DNA&lt;/a&gt; tweak that activity (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/18/15&lt;/em&gt;). It has also led to the discovery of thousands of genes that don’t make proteins, but instead make many different &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rna-molecules-crucial-roles-human-health-disease&quot;&gt;useful RNAs&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/7/19&lt;/em&gt;). Researcher &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00314-6&quot;&gt;lay out those accomplishments and others&lt;/a&gt; February 10 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That said, the human reference genome we use has certain limitations,” Wang says.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;For one thing, it isn’t really finished; gaps remain in the more than 3 billion DNA letter long template, especially in stretches of repetitive DNA. Those are holes where the technology that built the reference doesn’t do a good job of reading every letter. Scientists know there is DNA there, just not how much nor how the letters are arranged. And despite being a compilation of more than 60 people’s DNA, the reference doesn’t fully encapsulate the full range of human genetic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;Adding&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;diversity&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the easiest ways to compile a complete catalog of human diversity is to decipher, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00313-7&quot;&gt;sequence, the genomes of 3 million Africans&lt;/a&gt;, medical geneticist Ambroise Wonkam of the University of Cape Town in South Africa, proposes in a commentary also published February 10 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. Africa is where modern humans originated, and study after study has uncovered thousands to millions of new genetic variants among people of African descent&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, the Human Health and Heredity in Africa project, known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://h3africa.org/&quot;&gt;H3Africa&lt;/a&gt;, uncovered more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2859-7&quot;&gt;3 million never-before-seen single letter variants&lt;/a&gt; — known as SNPs, short for single nucleotide polymorphisms — by examining DNA of just 426 people from different parts of Africa, researchers reported October 28 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers won’t just find single DNA letter, or base, changes when they examine African genomes, Wonkam says. They may discover lots of DNA that no one expected was even in the human genome. Even healthy humans are sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/on-the-scene/missing-genes-sometimes-its-not-problem&quot;&gt;missing big chunks of DNA&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/22/09&lt;/em&gt;). And some people may have more DNA than others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a 2019 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6309586/&quot;&gt;study of 910 people of African descent&lt;/a&gt;, researchers discovered an additional 296.5 million DNA bases that aren’t in the current reference. That suggests sequencing Africans might uncover 10 percent or more of the human genome that hasn’t previously been cataloged. That bonus genetic material isn’t necessarily in the gaps researchers already knew about. It hasn’t been found because the 60 or so people whose DNA comprises the reference just didn’t happen to carry it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We need a database reference that is representative of humankind,” that is rooted in African origins, Wonkam says. “African population genomic variation is the next frontier” in human genetics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean researchers should stop studying people from other parts of the world, he says. A project to examine the genetics of Icelanders, for instance, may uncover genetic variants that arose among the founders of that island nation and are still carried by people today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But genetic diversity that was present in modern humans before the ancestors of Eurasians left Africa thousands of years ago is still present in people on that continent today, and more variants have arisen as people adapted to specific environments or just by chance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research on genetic variation in Africa is sure to help Africans better understand their health problems. But a reference that encompasses the full range of human genetic diversity will help everyone in the world, Wonkam says. Already, new cholesterol-lowering drugs and other medical advances have come from studying the DNA of people of African descent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Filling in the gaps&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Wonkam’s proposal may solve the genetic diversity problem, it doesn’t necessarily mend gaps in the existing reference genome.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The current reference genome was made by fitting together small strings of DNA like thousands of tiny jigsaw puzzle pieces. In some parts of the genome, the DNA sequence is repeated over and over again, producing virtually identical puzzle pieces. It’s hard to know exactly where all those pieces go and how many repetitions there are. So some repetitive pieces have been left out, leaving holes in the finished puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That can create problems, Wang says. For instance, doctors may sequence the DNA of a patient and find a genetic variant they suspect might be causing a health problem. But if the suspect DNA isn’t in the current reference, there’s no way to know whether the variant is harmful or not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is time to fully address this problem [with] the limitations of the current human genome assembly,” Wang says. To do that, Wang and other scientists with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://humanpangenome.org/about-us/&quot;&gt;Human Pangenome Reference Consortium&lt;/a&gt; will use new DNA deciphering technology, called long-range or long-read sequencing, to read each human chromosome from end to end.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2020, researchers reported the first fully complete sequence of a human chromosome, the X chromosome. That effort &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2547-7&quot;&gt;closed 29 gaps&lt;/a&gt; in the reference sequence for that chromosome, including 3.1 million bases spanning the centromere, the part of the chromosome important for separating chromosomes during cell division, researchers reported July 14 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. Learning more about centromeres may help researchers understand why chromosome division sometimes goes wrong, leading to cancer or genetic conditions such as Down syndrome.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That early success suggests that long-read sequencing technology can fill in the gaps in the reference genome, and help find the missing 10 percent of DNA. The pangenome team hopes to assemble complete genomes for 350 people from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And when he says complete, Wang means complete. The reference genome contains more than 3 billion DNA bases, but human cells have more than 6 billion bases. The discrepancy comes from representing just one set of chromosomes instead of the two sets people actually inherit, one from each parent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s because when the DNA was originally sequenced with a person’s DNA being cut into tiny pieces for reassembly later, there was no way to distinguish which little piece came from the chromosome inherited from a person’s mother from the one inherited from the father. So it was all mushed into one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But by sequencing each chromosome in its entirety, researchers will be able to construct a full picture of a person’s genome, including determining exactly what came from each parent. Those full pictures may allow researchers to better follow patterns of inheritance and track down genetic source of diseases more easily.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Investing in a better reference genome will have big payoffs in other ways too, says Wonkam. The Human Genome Project spent $3.8 billion to build the existing reference. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.genome.gov/27544383/calculating-the-economic-impact-of-the-human-genome-project&quot;&gt;That investment&lt;/a&gt; has not only advanced genetic medicine, but has also led to advancements in studying infectious diseases, friendly microbes and other areas of biomedical research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having a truly complete reference genome will be even more of a boon, Wonkam predicts. He estimates that the 10-year project to sequence the DNA of 3 million Africans will cost about $450 million a year. But “we’re going to reap a singular benefit, globally, far beyond [the cost].”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dans ce texte, j’essaie d’expliquer quelques concepts simples concernant la dynamique et le contrôle d’une épidémie. Je l’écris bien sûr en pensant à l’épidémie de Covid-19, mais la plupart des concepts sont généraux. En préambule, je tiens à préciser que je ne suis ni médecin ni épidémiologiste, donc je ne parlerai pratiquement pas des aspects purement médicaux, ni de subtilités d’épidémiologie, mais simplement de quelques notions générales. Ma spécialité est la modélisation de phénomènes dynamiques en biologie, en l’occurrence en neurosciences. Merci donc aux collègues compétents d’apporter des précisions ou corrections éventuelles, ou des références pertinentes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quelques remarques préliminaires sur les statistiques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avant de commencer les explications, je voudrais tout d’abord inviter le lecteur à la prudence quant à l’interprétation des statistiques, en particulier des statistiques de mortalité. A l’heure où j’écris ces lignes, on estime qu’environ 15% de la population française a été infectée. Autrement dit, l’épidémie est débutante. Les statistiques de mortalité ne sont donc pas un « bilan » de l’épidémie, mais des statistiques sur une épidémie en cours. Comparer avec le bilan d’épidémies passées, ou d’autres causes de mortalité, n’a donc pas beaucoup de sens (éventuellement, on pourrait multiplier par 5 ces statistiques pour avoir un ordre d’idée).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuxièmement, la mortalité d’une maladie ne dépend pas que du virus. Elle dépend aussi de la personne malade. Un facteur majeur est l’âge, et il faut donc prendre cela en compte lorsque l’on compare des pays de démographies très différentes. En première approximation, le risque de décès de la Covid-19 augmente avec l’âge de la même manière que le risque de décès hors Covid. On peut voir cela comme le fait que les jeunes sont peu à risque, ou bien que toutes les classes d’âge voient leur risque de décès dans l’année augmenter d’un même facteur. Quoi qu’il en soit, avec ce type de profil de mortalité, l’âge moyen ou médian au décès n’est pas très informatif puisqu’il est le même avec et sans infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troisièmement, la mortalité d’une maladie dépend aussi de la prise en charge. En l’occurrence, la Covid-19 se caractérise par un fort taux d’hospitalisation et de réanimation. La mortalité observée en France jusqu’à présent correspond à celle d’un système de soin qui n’est pas saturé. Naturellement, elle serait bien plus élevée si l’on ne pouvait pas procurer ces soins, c’est-à-dire si l’épidémie n’était pas contrôlée, et la mortalité se déplacerait également vers une population plus jeune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enfin, il va de soi que la gravité d’une maladie ne se réduit pas à sa mortalité. Une hospitalisation n’est généralement pas anodine, et les cas moins sévères peuvent avoir des séquelles à long terme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Le taux de reproduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Un virus est une entité qui peut se répliquer dans un hôte et se transmettre à d’autres hôtes. Contrairement à une bactérie qui est une cellule, un virus n’est pas à proprement parler un organisme, c’est-à-dire qu’il dépend totalement de l’hôte pour sa survie et sa reproduction. Par conséquent, pour comprendre la dynamique d’une épidémie virale, il faut s’intéresser au nombre d’hôtes infectés et à la transmission entre hôtes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Un paramètre important est le &lt;em&gt;taux de reproduction &lt;/em&gt;(R). C’est le nombre moyen de personnes qu’une personne infectée va contaminer. On voit que l’épidémie se développe si R&amp;gt;1, et s’éteint si R&amp;lt;1. A chaque transmission, le nombre de cas est multiplié par R. Ce taux de reproduction ne dit pas à quelle vitesse l’épidémie se développe, car cela dépend du temps d’incubation et de la période de contagiosité. C’est en fait un paramètre qui est surtout intéressant pour comprendre le contrôle de l’épidémie. Par exemple, si &lt;em&gt;R = 2&lt;/em&gt;, alors on peut contrôler l’épidémie en divisant par deux le nombre de ses contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comme le nombre de cas est multiplié par un certain facteur à chaque épisode de contamination, une épidémie a typiquement une dynamique exponentielle, c’est-à-dire que c’est le nombre de chiffres qui augmente régulièrement. Cela prend autant de temps de passer de 10 à 100 cas que de 100 à 1000 cas, ou de 1000 à 10 000 cas. La dynamique est donc de nature explosive. C’est pourquoi la quantité à suivre avec attention n’est pas tant le nombre de cas que ce taux de reproduction : dès que R&amp;gt;1, le nombre de cas peut rapidement exploser et il faut agir vite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturellement, ce raisonnement suppose que la population n’a pas été déjà infectée. Si une proportion &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; de la population est immunisée (infectée ou vaccinée), alors chaque personne infectée va contaminer en moyenne un nombre de personnes &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; x (1-&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;). L’épidémie va donc s’arrêter quand ce nombre descend en-dessous de 1, c’est-à-dire &lt;em&gt;p &amp;gt; 1- 1/R&lt;/em&gt;. Par exemple, avec &lt;em&gt;R = 3&lt;/em&gt;, l’épidémie s’arrête quand les 2/3 de population sont immunisés.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceci nous dit également l’impact de la vaccination en cours sur le contrôle de l’épidémie. Par exemple, à l’heure où j’écris ces lignes (22 février 2021), environ 2% de la population a été vaccinée (4% a reçu la première dose). Cela contribue donc à diminuer R de 2% (par exemple de 1.1 à 1.08). Il est donc clair que la vaccination n’aura pas d’effet important sur la dynamique globale avant plusieurs mois.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il est important de comprendre que ce taux de reproduction n’est pas une caractéristique intrinsèque du virus. Il dépend du virus, mais également de l’hôte qui peut être plus ou moins contagieux (on a parlé par exemple des « superspreaders »), d’aspects comportementaux, de mesures de protection (par exemple les masques). Ce taux n’est donc pas forcément homogène dans une population. Par exemple, il est vraisemblable que le R soit supérieur chez les jeunes actifs que chez les personnes âgées.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peut-on isoler une partie de la population ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Est-il possible de préserver la population la plus fragile en l’isolant du reste de la population, sans contrôler l’épidémie ? Cette hypothèse a été formulée plusieurs fois, bien que &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6526/230&quot;&gt;très critiquée dans la littérature scientifique&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On peut comprendre assez facilement que c’est une idée périlleuse. Isoler une partie de la population a un impact quasi nul sur le taux de reproduction R, et donc la dynamique de l’épidémie est inchangée. Il faut bien garder à l’esprit que contrôler une épidémie pour qu’elle s’éteigne suppose simplement de faire en sorte que R&amp;lt;1, de façon à ce que le nombre de cas décroisse exponentiellement. Ainsi pendant le confinement strict de mars 2020, le taux était d’environ R = 0.7. C’est suffisant pour que l’épidémie s’éteigne, mais il n’en reste pas moins qu’une personne infectée continue à contaminer d’autres gens. Par conséquent, à moins de parvenir à isoler ces personnes fragiles beaucoup plus strictement que lors du premier confinement (ce qui semble douteux étant donné qu’il s’agit pour partie de personnes dépendantes), l’épidémie dans cette population va suivre l’épidémie dans la population générale, avec la même dynamique mais dans une version un peu atténuée. Autrement dit, il semble peu plausible que cette stratégie soit efficace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Les variants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Un virus peut muter, c’est-à-dire que lorsqu’il se réplique dans un hôte, des erreurs sont introduites de sorte que les propriétés du virus changent. Cela peut avoir un impact sur les symptômes, ou sur la contagiosité. Naturellement, plus il y a d’hôtes infectés, plus il y a de variants, c’est donc un phénomène qui survient dans des épidémies non contrôlées.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supposons que R = 2 et qu’un variant ait un taux R = 4. Alors à chaque transmission, le nombre de cas du variant relatif au virus original est multiplié par 2. Au bout de 10 transmissions, le variant représente 99.9% des cas. Ceci reste vrai si des mesures restrictives réduisent la transmission (par exemple R=2/3 et R=4/3). Après ces 10 transmissions, le R global est celui du variant. Par conséquent, c’est le nombre de cas et le R du variant plus contagieux qui déterminent le nombre de cas et la dynamique à moyen terme (c’est-à-dire quelques semaines). Le nombre de cas du virus original et même le nombre de cas globaux sont essentiellement insignifiants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cela signifie que l’on peut être dans une dynamique explosive alors même que le nombre de cas diminue. Pour savoir si l’épidémie est sous contrôle, il faut regarder le R du variant le plus contagieux. A l’heure où j’écris, on est précisément dans la situation où le virus original est encore dominant avec R&amp;lt;1 et les variants ont un R&amp;gt;1, ce qui signifie que malgré une diminution globale des cas, on est dans une dynamique explosive qui sera apparente dans le nombre global de cas lorsque les variants seront dominants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Le contrôle épidémique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrôler l’épidémie signifie faire en sorte que R&amp;lt;1. Dans cette situation, le nombre de cas diminue exponentiellement et s’approche de 0. Il ne s’agit pas nécessairement de supprimer toute transmission mais de faire en sorte par une combinaison de mesures que R soit plus petit que 1. Ainsi, passer de R = 1.1 à 0.9 suffit pour passer d’une épidémie explosive à une extinction de l’épidémie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturellement, la mesure la plus sûre pour éteindre l’épidémie est d’empêcher toute relation sociale (le « confinement »). Mais il existe potentiellement de nombreuses autres mesures, et idéalement il s’agit de combiner plusieurs mesures à la fois efficaces et peu contraignantes, le confinement pouvant être utilisé en dernier recours lorsque ces mesures ont échoué. La difficulté est que l’impact d’une mesure n’est pas précisément connu pour un virus nouveau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ces connaissances sont cependant loin d’être négligeables après un an d’épidémie de Covid-19. On sait par exemple que le port du masque est très efficace (on s’en doutait déjà, étant donné que c’est une infection respiratoire). On sait que le virus se propage par projection de gouttelettes et par aérosols. On sait également que les écoles et les lieux de restauration collective sont des lieux importants de contamination. Cette observation peut conduire à fermer ces lieux, mais on pourrait alternativement les sécuriser par l’installation de ventilation et de filtres (investissement qui pourrait d’ailleurs être synergique avec un plan de rénovation énergétique).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il y a deux grands types de mesures. Il y a des mesures globales qui s’appliquent aux personnes saines comme aux porteurs du virus, comme le port du masque, la fermeture de certains lieux, la mise en place du télétravail. Le coût de ces mesures (au sens large, c’est-à-dire le coût économique et les contraintes) est fixe. Il y a des mesures spécifiques, c’est-à-dire qui sont déclenchées lorsqu’il y a un cas, comme le traçage, la fermeture d’une école, le confinement local. Ces mesures spécifiques ont un coût proportionnel au nombre de cas. Le coût global est donc une combinaison d’un coût fixe et d’un coût proportionnel au nombre de cas. Par conséquent, il est toujours plus coûteux de maîtriser une épidémie lorsque le nombre de cas est plus grand (choix qui semble pourtant avoir été fait en France après le deuxième confinement).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Le « plateau »&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Une remarque importante : les mesures ont un impact sur la progression de l’épidémie (R) et non directement sur le nombre de cas. Cela signifie que si l’on sait maintenir un nombre de cas haut (R=1), alors on sait tout aussi bien (avec les mêmes mesures), maintenir un nombre de cas bas. Avec un petit effort supplémentaire (R=0.9), on peut supprimer l’épidémie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoir comme objectif la saturation hospitalière n’a donc pas particulièrement d’intérêt, et est même un choix plus coûteux que la suppression. Il existe une justification à cet objectif, la stratégie consistant à « aplatir la courbe », qui a été suggérée au début de l’épidémie. Il s’agit de maximiser le nombre de personnes infectées de façon à immuniser rapidement toute la population. Maintenant qu’il existe un vaccin, cette stratégie n’a plus beaucoup de sens. Même sans vaccin, infecter toute la population sans saturer les services hospitaliers prendrait plusieurs années, sans parler naturellement de la mortalité.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;La suppression de l’épidémie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comme remarqué précédemment, il est plus facile de maîtriser une épidémie faible que forte, et donc une stratégie de contrôle doit viser non un nombre de cas « acceptables », mais un taux de reproduction R&amp;lt;1. Dans cette situation, le nombre de cas décroît exponentiellement. Lorsque le nombre de cas est très bas, il faut prendre en compte les cas importés. C’est-à-dire que sur une période de contamination, le nombre de cas va passer non plus de &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; à &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; x &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; mais de &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; à &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; x &lt;em&gt;n + &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;, où &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; est le nombre de cas importés. Le nombre de cas va donc se stabiliser à &lt;em&gt;I/(1-R)&lt;/em&gt; (par exemple, 3 fois le nombre de cas importés si R = 2/3). Si l’on veut diminuer encore le nombre de cas, il devient alors important d’empêcher l’importation de nouveaux cas (tests, quarantaine, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorsque le nombre de cas est très bas, il devient faisable d’appliquer des mesures spécifiques très poussées, c’est-à-dire pour chaque cas. Par exemple, pour chaque cas, on isole la personne, et l’on teste et on isole toutes les personnes susceptibles d’être également porteuses. Non seulement on identifie les personnes potentiellement contaminées par la personne positive, mais on recherche également la source de la contamination. En effet, si l’épidémie est portée par des événements de supercontamination (« clusters »), alors il devient plus efficace de remonter à la source de la contamination puis de suivre les cas contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A faible circulation, comme on dispose de ces moyens supplémentaires pour diminuer la transmission, il devient possible de lever certains moyens non spécifiques (par exemple le confinement général ou autres restrictions sociales, les fermetures d’établissements et même le port du masque). Pour que les moyens spécifiques aient un impact important, un point clé est que la majorité des cas puissent être détectés. Cela suppose des tests systématiques massifs, par exemple en utilisant des tests salivaires, des drive-in, des tests groupés, des contrôles de température. Cela suppose que les personnes positives ne soient pas découragées de se tester et s’isoler (en particulier, en maintenant les revenus). Cela suppose également un isolement systématique en attente de résultat pour les cas suspectés. Autrement dit, pour avoir une chance de fonctionner, cette stratégie doit être appliquée de manière la plus systématique possible. L’appliquer sur 10% des cas n’a pratiquement aucun intérêt. C’est pourquoi elle n’a de sens que lorsque la circulation du virus est faible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il est important d’observer que dans cette stratégie, l’essentiel du coût et des contraintes est porté par le dispositif de test, puisque le traçage et l’isolement ne se produisent que lorsqu’un cas est détecté, ce qui idéalement arrive très rarement. Si elle demande une certaine logistique, c’est en revanche une stratégie économique et peu contraignante pour la population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quand agir ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J’ai expliqué que maintenir un niveau élevé de cas est plus coûteux et plus contraignant que maintenir un niveau faible de cas. Maintenir un niveau très faible de cas est encore moins coûteux et contraignant, bien que cela demande plus d’organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bien entendu, pour passer d’un plateau haut à un plateau bas, il faut que l’épidémie décroisse, et donc transitoirement appliquer des mesures importantes. Si l’épidémie n’est pas contrôlée – et je rappelle que cela est le cas dès lors qu’un variant est en croissance (R&amp;gt;1) même si le nombre global de cas décroît – ces mesures vont devoir être appliquées à un moment donné. Quand faut-il les appliquer ? Est-il plus avantageux d’attendre le plus possible avant de le faire ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ce n’est clairement jamais le cas, car plus on attend, plus le nombre de cas augmente et donc plus les mesures restrictives devront être appliquées longtemps avant d’atteindre l’objectif de circulation faible, où des mesures plus fines (traçage) pourront prendre le relais. Cela peut sembler contre-intuitif si le nombre de cas est en décroissance mais c’est pourtant bien le cas, parce que le nombre de cas à moyen terme ne dépend que du nombre de cas du variant le plus contagieux, et non du nombre de cas global. Donc, si le variant le plus contagieux est en expansion, attendre ne fait qu’allonger la durée des mesures restrictives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De combien ? Supposons que le nombre de cas du virus (le variant le plus contagieux) double chaque semaine, et que les mesures restrictives divisent le nombre de cas par 2 en une semaine. Alors attendre une semaine avant de les appliquer allongent ces mesures d’une semaine (j’insiste : allongent, et non simplement décalent). Dans l’hypothèse (plus réaliste) où les mesures sont un peu moins efficaces, chaque semaine d’attente augmente la durée des mesures d’un peu plus d’une semaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il est donc toujours préférable d’agir dès que R&amp;gt;1, de façon à agir le moins longtemps possible, et non pas d’attendre que le nombre de cas augmente considérablement. La seule justification possible à l’attente pourrait être une vaccination massive qui laisserait espérer une décroissance de l’épidémie par l’immunisation, ce qui n’est manifestement pas le cas dans l’immédiat.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This blog was written by Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Director of Open Research Solutions for PLOS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Researchers are satisfied with their ability to share their own research data but may struggle with accessing other researchers’ data – according to PLOS research &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/njr5u&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;released as a preprint this week&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Therefore, to increase data sharing in a findable and accessible way, PLOS will focus on better integrating existing data repositories and promoting their benefits rather than creating new solutions. We also call on the scholarly publishing industry to improve journal data sharing policies to better support researchers’ needs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS has long supported Open Science with our data sharing policy. Our authors are far more likely to provide information about publicly available data compared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dashboard.stm-assoc.org/&quot;&gt;journals with less stringent policies&lt;/a&gt;. But best practice for data sharing – use of data repositories – is observed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230416&quot;&gt;less than 30% of PLOS publications&lt;/a&gt;. To help us understand if there are opportunities for new solutions to help improve adoption of best practice, we built on previous research into the frequency of problems associated with sharing research data. We investigated the &lt;em&gt;importance&lt;/em&gt; researchers attach to different tasks associated with data sharing, and researchers’ &lt;em&gt;satisfaction&lt;/em&gt; with their ability to complete these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/05/what-are-your-priorities-for-data-sharing/&quot;&gt;survey conducted in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which received 728 completed responses, we found that tasks relating to research impact, funder policy compliance, and credit had the highest importance scores. Tasks associated with funder, journal, and institutional policy compliance – including preparation of Data Management Plans (DMPs) – received high satisfaction scores from researchers, on average.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;52% of respondents reuse research data but the average satisfaction score for obtaining data for reuse – such as accessing data from journal articles or making requests for data from other individuals – was relatively low. Tasks associated with sharing data were rated somewhat important and respondents were reasonably well satisfied with their ability to accomplish them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;624&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/yitlUEq3MxJm9SMFMulTwu9TcLufAw66cpmaVwjgUQigSJ_s_9HgWwNur3kEyjqicTZ1h9UXHhk7m36GJmZYkaHuPEKoNgwXzAUtFS-An0pA0_r5TXKnWiL496UgLwxuhtXRemuD&quot; width=&quot;624&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; When we plot mean importance and satisfaction score, respondents were on average satisfied with their ability to complete the majority of tasks associated with Data Preparation, Data Publishing and Reuse of their own data but dissatisfied with their ability to complete tasks associated with Reuse of other researchers’ data. Tasks associated with meeting policy requirements are both important and well satisfied.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the implications?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We presume that researchers are unlikely to seek &lt;em&gt;new &lt;/em&gt;solutions to a problem or task that they are satisfied in their &lt;em&gt;ability &lt;/em&gt;to accomplish. This implies there are few opportunities for new solutions to meet researcher needs for data sharing – at least in our cohort, which consisted mostly of PLOS authors. PLOS – and other publishers – can likely meet these needs for data sharing by working to seamlessly integrate existing solutions that reduce the effort involved in some tasks, and focusing on advocacy and education around the benefits of sharing data in a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) manner. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The challenges that researchers have reusing data could be addressed in part by strengthening journal data sharing policies – such as only permitting “data available on request” when there are legal or ethical restrictions on sharing, and improving the links between articles and supporting datasets. Generic “data available on request” statements in publications, which are not permitted under PLOS’s policies, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011784&quot;&gt;usually mean data will not be available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While our research revealed a “negative result” with respect to new solution opportunities, the results are informative for how PLOS can best meet known researcher needs. This includes more closely partnering with established data repositories and improving the linking of research data and publications.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like countless other parents across the UK, I’m finding it pretty hard to maintain enthusiasm for my kids’ home-schooling lessons. Or muster it, for that matter. Yet we all know that when an instructor is enthusiastic, those sessions are more enjoyable — and we remember more. While this might be common knowledge, however, “the underlying mechanisms for the favourable effects of teacher enthusiasm are still largely unknown,” write Angelica Moè at the University of Padova, Italy, and her colleagues, in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjep.12399?af=R&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Educational Psychology&lt;/em&gt;. The team therefore set out to better understand its power. And in a series of studies, they explored the idea that attention is key — that a more enthusiastic delivery grabs pupils’ attention more, which improves their memory for the material.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41419&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an initial study, German children aged 8 to 12 listened to a trained instructor read two brief texts, one of which was a description of the characteristics of dragonflies, the other a story about a farmer. The instructor read with either low enthusiasm (a monotone voice, few or no body movements, fixed facial expression, eyes fixed on the text) or high enthusiasm (exuberant movements, excited and varied vocal delivery, shining eyes oriented towards the children, varied facial expressions). The team found that kids in the high enthusiasm condition not only reported enjoying both texts more — and smiled more — but were also spent more time looking at the instructor, suggesting they were more attentive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, a total of 54 Italian pupils aged 9 to 11 underwent a very similar procedure, except that some had to complete a task that required their attention at the same time. (They had to spot and circle pictures of bells, which were among other small pictures on an A4 sheet). For the kids who were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; given this extra task — i.e. those whose attention wasn’t already tied up — those in the high enthusiasm group showed better recall of the texts when questioned afterwards than those in the low enthusiasm group. However, the experimenter’s enthusiasm level had no impact on the bell-circlers’ recall, “thus showing that attention is among the underlying mechanisms explaining the positive effect of enthusiasm on recall,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A final study using the same texts found that when a distracting task doesn’t require sustained attention — in this case, some kids were asked simply to touch corners of their desk in a clockwise direction, instead of circling bells — greater instructor enthusiasm did make for better later recall for the narrative text. This provides further evidence that an enthusiastic delivery style improves recall “&lt;em&gt;only when&lt;/em&gt; a secondary task is not competing for the students’ attention”, the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what are the implications of these findings? Some people — and some teachers — are naturally more enthusiastic than others. But it is possible to learn to be more demonstrative and engaging, both physically and verbally. So perhaps there’s a case for arguing that more naturally reserved teachers might be encouraged to consciously try to be more enthusiastic — but not necessarily all the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that high enthusiasm is only important when the listeners aren’t simultaneously paying attention to something else. So while extra enthusiasm during a lecture could help students to enjoy the lecture more, pay more attention to the content and learn better, it would not help students engaged in a practical challenge, for example. “This is an important message for those who believe they should be enthusiastic at any cost, but who may suffer from a constant, effortful up-regulation of positive emotions,” the team notes. “Our results demonstrate that they may ‘economize’ their efforts of up-regulating their enthusiasm and do so only in situations where students are not engaged in tasks competing for their attention.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Economise the efforts of up-regulation… Well, perhaps that’s something I can try at home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjep.12399?af=R&quot;&gt;Displayed enthusiasm attracts attention and improves recall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hidden-planet-nine-solar-system-evidence-may-not-hold-up"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3096594</id>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Planet Nine might be a mirage. What once looked like evidence for a massive planet hiding at the solar system’s edge may be an illusion, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We can’t rule it out,” says Kevin Napier, a physicist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “But there’s not necessarily a reason to rule it in.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous work has suggested that a number of far-out objects in the solar system cluster in the sky as if they are being shepherded by an unseen giant planet, at least 10 times the mass of Earth. Astronomers dubbed the invisible world Planet Nine or Planet X.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, a new analysis of 14 of those remote bodies shows &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05601&quot;&gt;no evidence for such clustering&lt;/a&gt;, knocking down the primary reason to believe in Planet Nine. Napier and colleagues reported the results February 10 at arXiv.org in a paper to appear in the&lt;em&gt; Planetary Science Journal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The idea of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/distant-planet-may-lurk-far-beyond-neptune&quot;&gt;distant planet lurking far beyond Neptune&lt;/a&gt; received a surge in interest in 2014, when astronomers Chad Trujillo of Northern Arizona University and Scott Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution for Science reported a collection of distant solar system bodies called trans-Neptunian objects with strangely bunched-up orbits (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/14/14&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Caltech planetary scientists Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin used six trans-Neptunian objects to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-clues-search-planet-nine&quot;&gt;refine the possible properties of Planet Nine&lt;/a&gt;, pinning it to an orbit between 500 and 600 times as far from the sun as Earth’s (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/5/16&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But those earlier studies all relied on just a handful of objects that may not have represented everything that’s out there, says Gary Bernstein, an astronomer at the University of Pennsylvania. The objects might have seemed to show up in certain parts of the sky only because that’s where astronomers happened to look.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to know what you couldn’t see, in addition to what you did see,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To account for that uncertainty, Napier, Bernstein and colleagues combined observations from three surveys — the Dark Energy Survey, the Outer Solar System Origins Survey and the original survey run by Sheppard and Trujillo — to assess 14 trans-Neptunian objects, more than twice as many as in the 2016 study. These objects all reside between 233 and 1,560 times as far from the sun as Earth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team then ran computer simulations of about 10 billion fake trans-Neptunian objects, distributed randomly all around the sky, and checked to see if their positions matched what the surveys should be able to see. They did.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It really looks like we just find things where we look,” Napier says. It’s sort of like if you lost your keys at night and searched for them under a streetlamp, not because you thought they were there, but because that’s where the light was. The new study basically points out the streetlamps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Once you see where the lampposts really are, it becomes more clear that there is some serious selection bias going on with the discovery of these objects,” Napier says. That means the objects are just as likely to be distributed randomly across the sky as they are to be clumped up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t necessarily mean Planet Nine is done for, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“On Twitter, people have been very into saying that this kills Planet Nine,” Napier says. “I want to be very careful to mention that this does not kill Planet Nine. But it’s not good for Planet Nine.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are other mysteries of the solar system that Planet Nine would have neatly explained, says astronomer Samantha Lawler of the University of Regina in Canada, who was not involved in the new study. A distant planet could explain why some far-out solar system objects have orbits that are tilted relative to those of the larger planets or where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-rock-comet-centaur-astronomy&quot;&gt;proto-comets called centaurs&lt;/a&gt; come from (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/18/20&lt;/em&gt;). That was part of the appeal of the Planet Nine hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But the entire reason for it was the clustering of these orbits,” she says. “If that clustering is not real, then there’s no reason to believe there is a giant planet in the distant solar system that we haven’t discovered yet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Batygin, one of the authors of the 2016 paper, isn’t ready to give up. “I’m still quite optimistic about Planet Nine,” he says. He compares Napier’s argument to seeing a group of bears in the forest: If you see a bunch of bears to the east, you might think there was a bear cave there. “But Napier is saying the bears are all around us, because we haven’t checked everywhere,” Batygin says. “That logical jump is not one you can make.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evidence for Planet Nine should show up only in the orbits of objects that are stable over billions of years, Batygin adds. But the new study, he says, is “strongly contaminated” by unstable objects — bodies that may have been nudged by Neptune and lost their position in the cluster or could be on their way to leaving the solar system entirely. “If you mix dirt with your ice cream, you’re going to mostly taste dirt,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lawler says there’s not a consensus among people who study trans-Neptunian objects about which ones are stable and which ones are not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone agrees, though, that in order to prove Planet Nine’s existence or nonexistence, astronomers need to discover more trans-Neptunian objects. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-observatory-named-after-dark-matter-pioneer-vera-rubin&quot;&gt;Vera Rubin Observatory&lt;/a&gt; in Chile should find hundreds more after it begins surveying the sky in 2023 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/10/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There always may be some gap in our understanding,” Napier says. “That’s why we keep looking.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a fascinating sleep study, researchers have managed to “talk” to people in lucid dreams. &lt;/strong&gt;Dreamers were given simple yes/no questions or asked to do basic arithmetic, and had to respond by moving their eyes and facial muscles. Several participants were able to correctly answer the questions in their sleep. The researchers hope that this new method will ultimately improve our understanding of sleep and consciousness, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/why-do-people-have-lucid-dreams&quot;&gt;writes Claire Cameron&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Inverse&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychologists have found problems in a number of papers linking violence in movies and video games to real-world aggression. &lt;/strong&gt;Some of the papers have been retracted, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/02/research-linking-violent-entertainment-aggression-retracted-after-scrutiny&quot;&gt;reports Cathleen O’Grady&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, but others live on, leaving researchers concerned about how they have influenced the field.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public shaming has been around in one form or another for much of human history — but the internet has allowed it to occur at a scale never seen before. &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;Discover Magazine, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/shame-and-the-rise-of-the-social-media-outrage-machine&quot;&gt;Timothy Meinch explores&lt;/a&gt; the implications of this new era of shame and social media outrage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We reported earlier this week on &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/18/how-to-deal-with-boredom-digested/&quot;&gt;how to deal with feeling bored&lt;/a&gt; — and the surprising benefits that boredom can sometimes have&lt;/strong&gt;. Over at &lt;em&gt;BBC Worklife&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210216-how-boredom-can-be-a-force-for-good-or-bad&quot;&gt;Sara Harrison examines&lt;/a&gt; more findings about the “unique emotional state” that is boredom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every day we read other people’s minds, trying to understand what they are thinking.&lt;/strong&gt; But this process is different from empathy, which involves understanding another’s emotions. Now a group of researchers have created a new scale to distinguish between the two, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/the-science-of-mind-reading-our-new-test-reveals-how-well-we-understand-others-155241&quot;&gt;reporting their preliminary results&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pausing before answering a question can make you seem like you are lying&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/feb/16/slow-responses-more-likely-to-be-perceived-as-lies-study-finds&quot;&gt;reports Natalie Grover&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. Participants read about, listened to, or watched people responding in a range of scenarios, from everyday conversations to police interrogations. Slower responses were seen as less credible and sincere.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Each year in California, thousands of wildfires ravage hundreds of thousands of hectares of land. Deciphering how well large swaths of vegetation recover over time can be tough from the ground. New radar maps now reveal the patchwork of plant destruction and regrowth in the wake of more than a decade of fires in Angeles National Forest and other areas near Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A NASA research plane equipped with radar instruments, known as UAVSAR, flew over Southern California multiple times from 2010 to 2020 to produce a detailed map of the terrain below. By sending microwave pulses toward the Earth’s surface and measuring the signals that bounce back, the instruments can detect changes of a few millimeters in surface height. They’re also sensitive to moisture, says Yunling Lou, a radar engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. The resulting maps can distinguish areas with trees and shrublike chapparal from bare earth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lou and her colleagues are developing an approach &lt;a href=&quot;https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147872/a-mosaic-of-fire-data&quot;&gt;to color-code the maps by year&lt;/a&gt; to track large-scale changes in vegetation and monitor the recovery of forests and shrubland after destructive wildfires. Areas with vegetation show up as red in 2010, green in 2017 and blue in 2020. When the three maps are laid atop each other, they tell a story of loss and regrowth. For instance, the 2016 Fish Fire destroyed vegetation that was present in 2010 and didn’t grow back by 2017 or 2020, so it still appears red in a composite map. The area affected by the 2020 Bobcat Fire appears in yellow: Vegetation was present in 2010 and 2017 (red and green combine to make yellow) but not 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;map of vegetation changes near Los Angeles in 2010, 2017 and 2020&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096523&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021021_jl_wildlife-recovery_inline_desktop_REV.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096523&quot;&gt;A multicolored approach combines vegetation maps from 2010 (red), 2017 (green) and 2020 (blue). A closer look at Angeles National Forest and other areas near Los Angeles shows how specific fires over the past decade have shaped forests and shrubland. For example, the area affected by the 2020 Bobcat Fire is yellow because vegetation was present in 2010 and 2017 (red and green combine to make yellow) but not 2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096523&quot;&gt;Joshua Stevens/NASA Earth Observatory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;map of vegetation changes near Los Angeles in 2010, 2017 and 2020&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096524&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021021_jl_wildlife-recovery_inline_mobile_REV.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096524&quot;&gt;A multicolored approach combines vegetation maps from 2010 (red), 2017 (green) and 2020 (blue). A closer look at Angeles National Forest and other areas near Los Angeles shows how specific fires over the past decade have shaped forests and shrubland. For example, the area affected by the 2020 Bobcat Fire is yellow because vegetation was present in 2010 and 2017 (red and green combine to make yellow) but not 2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096524&quot;&gt;Joshua Stevens/NASA Earth Observatory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So much of the Angeles National Forest was impacted by fire at some point and you have patches that are in different stages of regeneration,” says Naiara Pinto, a landscape ecologist at JPL. The color-coding method could allow researchers to identify factors, such as vegetation and soil types, that affect why distinct areas regenerate at different speeds. Such maps could also potentially be used to identify burned regions without vegetation and at risk for landslides.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team is continuing to develop additional ways to use data collected by UAVSAR. The radar can also penetrate smoke or clouds, potentially allowing it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-takes-flight-to-study-californias-wildfire-burn-areas&quot;&gt;track wildfires in real time&lt;/a&gt; to assist firefighters actively fighting blazes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-magnetic-field-reversal-mass-extinctions-environment-crisis"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3096542</id>
		<updated>2021-02-18T20:02:25+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A flip-flop of Earth’s magnetic poles between 42,000 and 41,000 years ago briefly but dramatically shrank the magnetic field’s strength — and may have triggered a cascade of environmental crises on Earth, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the help of new, precise carbon dating obtained from ancient tree fossils, the researchers correlated shifts in climate patterns, large mammal extinctions and even changes in human behavior just before and during the Laschamps excursion, a brief reversal of the magnetic poles that lasted less than a thousand years. It’s the first study to &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abb8677&quot;&gt;directly link a magnetic pole reversal to large-scale environmental changes&lt;/a&gt;, the team reports in the Feb. 19 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During a reversal, Earth’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-core-solidified-just-time-save-magnetic-field&quot;&gt;protective magnetic field&lt;/a&gt;, which shields the planet from a barrage of charged particles streaming from the sun, can lose strength (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/28/19&lt;/em&gt;). So some researchers have suggested that these flip-flops &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-scientists-earth-magnetic-field-suspect-extinctions&quot;&gt;may be linked to extinction events&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/19/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But evidence for this has proven elusive. In fact, “the general belief had been that geomagnetic changes had no impact on climate or anything else,” says Alan Cooper, an evolutionary biologist at BlueSky Genetics in Adelaide. One reason for that belief is a dearth of precise dates for the timing and duration of the geomagnetic event to correlate with environmental, ice core and magnetic rock records.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enter New Zealand’s kauri tree, among the most ancient in the world. The country’s swampy bogs preserve the relics of kauri trees dating as far back as the Laschamps excursion. Cooper and his colleagues obtained cross-sections from four ancient trees recovered from a swamp at Ng­āwhā Springs in northern New Zealand, and analyzed them for carbon-14, a radioactive form of carbon. (This is the first paper Cooper has led since he was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03932-3&quot;&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Adelaide in December 2019 for misconduct, allegations which he has denied.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Kauri tree&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096544&quot; height=&quot;453&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021821_cg_pole-flip_inline_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096544&quot;&gt;Kauri trees (one shown) have grown in New Zealand for thousands of years. By analyzing tree rings of preserved trees in the Ngawha swampland, scientists identified evidence to suggest a magnetic pole flip around 41,000 years ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096544&quot;&gt;Mark Meredith/Moment/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In particular, one massive preserved log dating to about 41,000 years ago offered up a 1,700-year-long carbon-14 record. That record revealed major changes in carbon-14 during the time period running up to and including the Laschamps excursion, the team reports. That makes sense: Increasing incoming cosmic rays — as would occur with a weakened magnetic field — also produce more carbon-14 in the atmosphere, a carbon signature which would then become incorporated into the tree’s tissues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team simulated how a weakened magnetic field might alter atmospheric weather patterns. The computer analysis suggested that the increase of charged particles entering the atmosphere would also increase the production of atmospheric hydrogen and nitrogen oxides — molecules that tend to consume ozone. That would reduce the ability of stratospheric ozone to shield Earth’s denizens from ultraviolet radiation. The atmospheric changes would also affect how much sunlight is absorbed at different layers in the atmosphere, leading to large-scale changes in weather patterns that would have cooled the planet.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Such effects may have in fact occurred at that time. Using the carbon-14 dates from the kauri trees, the team examined sediment, pollen, and other data from before and during the Laschamps excursion that point to sudden cooling at locations from Australia to the Andes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the most intense effects did not occur during the actual pole reversal, the team found, but in the several hundred years leading up to it, spanning about 42,300 to 41,600 years ago. During the actual reversal, the field was only about 28 percent as strong as it is today. But during that transitional period, field strength shrank to about 6 percent of its current strength. The researchers dubbed this the “Adams Transitional Geomagnetic Event” — for Douglas Adams, author of &lt;em&gt;The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; series. Adams is often associated with the number 42, said in his books to be the answer to “the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long debated whether climate change or human hunters were more to blame for extinction events that wiped such giant mammals as woolly mammoths and &lt;em&gt;Diprotodon&lt;/em&gt;, a kind of super-sized Australian wombat. “It was actually one of the motivators for this study,” says study coauthor Chris Turney, a paleoclimatologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sudden-heat-spikes-did-ice-ages-mammoth-mammals&quot;&gt;a 2015 study by Cooper, Turney and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, “we noticed that some of the megafaunal extinctions appear to cluster, and we started asking why,” Turney says (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/23/15&lt;/em&gt;). One such cluster of Australian megafauna extinctions, including the demise of &lt;em&gt;Diprotodon&lt;/em&gt; and the giant kangaroo &lt;em&gt;Procoptodon goliah&lt;/em&gt;, occurred around 42,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team compared the dates of the magnetic event with previous records from ice cores that can reflect changes in solar activity. These data suggested the solar activity was at a minimum at the time. The combination of a weak magnetic field and this decrease in the sun’s output around the same time “created the perfect storm” of climate and broader environmental changes, placing a major stress on megafauna populations, Turney says. Those factors may also have led to increased competition between megafauna and human populations, as well as with Neandertals, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another possible line of evidence for a diminished ozone layer: an increasing abundance of red ochre handprints made by humans in cave paintings, the researchers note. Red ochre is thought to have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/underwater-caves-ochre-mines-yucatan-peninsula&quot;&gt;used as a sunscreen&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/3/20&lt;/em&gt;). There may also have been increasing use of caves between about 42,000 and 40,000 years ago, possibly as shelter from the more intense sun, the researchers report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; This is the first study to consider such a broad range of environmental consequences of extreme magnetic field changes, says Monika Korte, a geomagnetist at the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam. “The suggested links seem conceivable to me,” Korte says. But, she adds, “the biggest value of the paper is that it’s putting out several ideas that should be investigated further.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether other magnetic reversals may have prompted similar upheavals in the past remains unknown, but “we hope the community will look at biological and archaeological datasets through this different lens,” Turney says. Improving the precision of isotopic dating for these events will be key — and radiocarbon dates gleaned from the New Zealand kauri trees may be able to help with other recent reversals, such as a brief reversal event called the Mono Lake Excursion that occurred about 34,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What long-term environmental havoc may have been wreaked by much longer reversal events recorded in ancient rocks, such the 20,000-year-long Brunhes-Matuyama reversal that began 781,000 years ago, is an even more tantalizing question, Cooper says. “The impacts may have been enormous.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-black-hole-discovery-cygnus-massive"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The first black hole ever discovered still has a few surprises in store.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New observations of the black hole–star pair called Cygnus X-1 indicate that the black hole weighs about 21 times as much as the sun — nearly 1.5 times heavier than past estimates. The updated mass has astronomers rethinking how some black hole–forming stars evolve. For a star-sized, or stellar, black hole that massive to exist in the Milky Way, its parent star must have shed less mass through stellar winds than expected, researchers report online February 18 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Knowing how much mass stars lose through stellar winds over their lifetimes is important for understanding how these stars enrich their surroundings with heavy elements. It’s also key to understanding the masses and compositions of those stars when they explode and leave behind black holes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The updated mass measurement of Cygnus X-1 is “a big change to an old favorite,” says Tana Joseph, an astronomer at the University of Amsterdam not involved in the work. Stephen Hawking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/history-black-holes-science-news&quot;&gt;famously bet&lt;/a&gt; physicist Kip Thorne that the Cygnus X-1 system, discovered in 1964, did not include a black hole — and conceded the wager in 1990, when scientists had broadly accepted that Cygnus X-1 contained the first known black hole in the universe (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/10/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Astronomers got a new look at Cygnus X-1 using the Very Long Baseline Array, or VLBA. This network of 10 radio dishes stretches across the United States, from Hawaii to the Virgin Islands, collectively forming a continent-sized radio dish. In 2016, the VLBA tracked radio-bright jets of material spewing out of Cygnus X-1’s black hole for six days (the time it took for the black hole and its companion star to orbit each other once). Those observations offered a clear view of how the black hole’s position in space shifted over the course of its orbit. That, in turn, helped researchers refine the estimated distance to Cygnus X-1.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new observations suggest that Cygnus X-1 is about 7,200 light-years from Earth, rather than the previous estimate of about 6,000 light-years. This implies that the star in Cygnus X-1 is even brighter, and therefore bigger, than astronomers thought. The star weighs about 40.6 suns, the researchers estimate. The black hole must also be more massive in order to explain its gravitational tug on such a massive star. The black hole weighs about 21.2 suns — much heftier than its previously estimated 14.8 solar masses, the scientists say. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new mass measurement for Cygnus X-1’s black hole is so big that it challenges astronomers’ understanding of the massive stars that collapse to form black holes, says study coauthor Ilya Mandel, an astrophysicist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes stars are born with quite high masses — there are observations of stars being born with masses of well over 100 solar masses,” Mandel says. But such enormous stars are thought to shed much of their weight through stellar winds before turning into black holes. The bigger the star and the more heavy elements it contains, the stronger its stellar winds. So in heavy element–rich galaxies such as the Milky Way, big stars — no matter their starting mass — are supposed to shrink down to about 15 solar masses before collapsing into black holes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cygnus X-1’s 21-solar-mass black hole undermines that idea.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors have discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo&quot;&gt;black holes weighing tens of solar masses&lt;/a&gt; in other galaxies (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/21/21&lt;/em&gt;). But that is probably because LIGO peers at distant galaxies that existed earlier in the universe, Joseph says. Back then, fewer heavy elements existed, so stellar winds were weaker. With the new Cygnus X-1 measurement, “now we have to say, hang on, we’re in a [heavy element]–rich environment compared to the early universe … but we still managed to make this really massive black hole,” she says, “so maybe we’re not losing as much mass through stellar winds as we initially thought.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The project, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/worlds-first-coronavirus-human-challenge-study-receives-ethics-approval-in-the-uk&quot;&gt;received ethics approval&lt;/a&gt; February 17 from the U.K. government, will study how much virus is required to kick-start an infection. Eventually, researchers could then address other questions, like how well different vaccines work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In human challenge trials, volunteers are deliberately infected with a pathogen in a controlled environment. Researchers can then closely study the progression of disease or potential treatments with a level of detail largely unavailable in traditional trials, which require waiting for participants to pick up the disease on their own. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The possibility of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-human-challenge-trial-infect-people-vaccine&quot;&gt;COVID-19 challenge trials have stirred controversy&lt;/a&gt;; some question the ethics of putting volunteers at risk from a relatively new pathogen whose long-term consequences aren’t fully understood (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/27/20&lt;/em&gt;). For this trial, the promise of accelerated research outweighs the risks to participants, U.K regulators say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think a case could be made that the risks are acceptable for young, healthy volunteers,” says Seema Shah, a bioethicist at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago who is not involved in the trial. “People might still disagree,” she adds, “especially with the uncertainty about longer term morbidity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within a month, researchers hope to enroll up to 90 healthy volunteers ages 18 to 30 who haven’t contracted the coronavirus. People under 30 are generally at a lower risk of hospitalization or death than older people, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-severe-covid19-cases-young-adults&quot;&gt;but serious illness can still occur&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/9/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In isolated hospital rooms, volunteers will be exposed to varying levels of an original coronavirus variant that’s been circulating since March 2020. Volunteers will then be monitored round-the-clock, allowing researchers to determine the minimum dose of coronavirus required to start infection, Andrew Catchpole, chief scientific officer at hVIVO, a pharmaceutical services clinical research organization in London that will help run the trial, said in a news statement. Figuring out how much exposure leads to infection is one of the longstanding open questions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers can also track a volunteer’s immune response over the course of infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The answers to these basic research questions lay the groundwork for future studies. For instance, knowing the minimum infectious dose could enable future, yet-to-be-approved challenge trials that try to test vaccine candidates, or determine whether new variants of the virus can dodge naturally acquired immunity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such questions are important to answer, says Shah, but with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-uk-variant-more-contagious-us-dominant-strain&quot;&gt;coronavirus variants&lt;/a&gt; that are more contagious, and perhaps more deadly, now becoming dominant, it raises the question of how much impact this trial can have (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/15/21&lt;/em&gt;). They may behave differently than the strain used for this trial, weakening the broader applicability of its results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, a future trial that does head-to-head comparisons of vaccine candidates could be valuable, but, Shah asks, “if you’re doing a challenge trial with a strain that is eventually no longer the dominant strain, what does that tell you about vaccine efficacy?” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Precisely how this newly approved human challenge will work remains unclear, as the details haven’t been made public. The researchers say they plan to publish the protocol and an explanation of the study design at some point in the future. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One year into lockdown, and it’s safe to say a lot of us are very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; bored. We’ve watched all the boxsets we can stomach, developed (and subsequently ditched) a long list of increasingly esoteric hobbies, and have quite probably exhausted every possible walking route within several miles of our home. Yet the boredom persists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lockdown is, for most of us, an unusually boredom-inducing situation to be in, unable as we are to engage in many of the outside activities we would usually pass the time with. But boredom itself is common: as Camus rather pessimistically put it, “the truth is that everyone is bored”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So how do you deal with boredom? And does being bored even come with some benefits? Here’s the research on boredom, digested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41397&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t look at your phone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first thing many of us do when we feel even a twinge of boredom is reach for our phones, ready to endlessly scroll until we’re bored of that and switch to something else.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But one study suggests that, at least during working hours, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/16/looking-at-your-phone-at-work-might-make-you-even-more-bored/&quot;&gt;smartphone use doesn’t actually do very much to relieve boredom&lt;/a&gt;. While phone use increased as workers became more bored, it also worked the other way around: participants were &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; bored after using their smartphone than they were when they started.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It could be that the act of switching tasks from work to using a phone depletes our mental resources, and the reward of a sneaky look at your phone isn’t able to counteract the additional cognitive load. Or perhaps looking at your phone can underline the tedium of the task you’re trying to escape from. Either way, the results suggest that clinging to our phones might not be the way to relieve our boredom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reframe the way you think about boredom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nobody really likes being bored. But thinking about boredom not as a chore but as an opportunity for introspection might make it easier to bear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Tim Lomas, from the University of East London, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/08/23/youre-not-bored-youre-meditating-on-finding-value-in-a-maligned-emotion/&quot;&gt;purposefully made himself bored&lt;/a&gt; while on a long haul flight, making minute-by-minute notes about what he was thinking and feeling over the course of an hour. Rather poetically, he described his thoughts “emerging unbidden like fish appearing in an ocean”, and was “intrigued by how slippery, elusive and strange the mind was, a fleeting dance of vague ephemera”. He concluded that if people “were to regard boredom as a meditative experience, it may no longer be appraised as negative; indeed it may no longer even be boring.” York University’s Professor John Eastwood has similarly &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-28/april-2015/exciting-side-boredom&quot;&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that boredom offers a chance to “discover the possibility and content of one’s desires”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So with a bit of introspection, you could turn your boredom into something more meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do something creative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a 2014 study, Sandi Mann and Rebekah Cadman, both from the University of Central Lancashire, found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10400419.2014.901073&quot;&gt;boredom actually increased creativity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked to either write something novel or do something undeniably tedious: copy numbers out of the telephone directory. All participants then completed a &lt;em&gt;creative&lt;/em&gt; task, coming up with as many uses for two polystyrene cups as they possibly could. And those in the boring condition came up with far more uses than those in the non-boring condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So not only could indulging your creativity be a way out of boredom, boredom itself might also give your creativity a boost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get nostalgic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment, a lot of us are probably feeling pretty nostalgic for a life before the pandemic. Could focusing on that nostalgia help our boredom, too?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one 2013 paper published in &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt;, participants were first induced into high or low states of boredom by being asked to copy down either two or ten pieces of text about concrete mixtures. They then retrieved either a neutral or nostalgic memory. Those who were in high states of boredom before retrieving a nostalgic memory &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-30613-001&quot;&gt;recorded feeling &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; nostalgic overall&lt;/a&gt; than those who were in low states of boredom. A follow-up experiment also found that nostalgia can actually &lt;em&gt;counteract&lt;/em&gt; the effects of boredom, creating a sense of meaning in people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boredom often comes with a sense of existential emptiness, so reestablishing yourself as a person with meaning and purpose could help — and the way to do that could be through meditating on meaningful past times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let your mind wander&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mind wandering isn’t always a positive activity, particularly if you’re trying (and failing) to get on with an important task: mind wandering has been linked to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(11)00087-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1364661311000878%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&quot;&gt;poorer reading comprehension&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FPBR.16.5.857&quot;&gt;worse memory&lt;/a&gt;, to use just two examples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, if you’re bored, it could offer some relief. According to one literature review, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-07203-001&quot;&gt;mind wandering can make boring tasks feel shorter&lt;/a&gt;, help us disengage from boring surroundings, and improve our moods while we’re doing something tedious. And as mind wandering has also been linked with increased creativity and problem-solving skills, there are other potential benefits too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tackle it head on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Schoolwork can be a serious cause of boredom — who doesn’t remember watching the clock tick slowly by as we sat in a class we hated? Luckily, this also makes school a good place to &lt;em&gt;study&lt;/em&gt; boredom, and in 2011 one team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1041608010001093&quot;&gt;explored a variety of different ways of dealing with boredom&lt;/a&gt;, focusing on avoidance (thinking or doing something unrelated to the boring situation) and “approach coping” (thinking or doing something that actively changes the boring situation itself).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team grouped students’ responses to a boring maths lesson into three categories: “reappraisers” dealt with boredom by meditating on the value of mathematics and therefore changing their view of the situation; “criticizers” tried to act to improve the situation by suggesting changes to the teacher; and “evaders” tried to avoid boredom by occupying themselves with something else.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reappraising group were the least bored overall, and also experienced the most positive outcomes when it came to emotions and motivation: they enjoyed maths more and experienced the lowest levels of anxiety. So, as Tim Lomas’ research also suggests, rethinking what boredom actually represents, rather than trying to avoid it altogether, might be the best way of ameliorating it long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abstract for the talk is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurolib-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;neurolib&lt;/a&gt; is a computational framework for whole-brain modelling written in Python.
It provides a set of neural mass models that represent the average activity of a brain region on a mesoscopic scale.
In a whole-brain network model, brain regions are connected with each other based on structural connectivity data, i.e. the connectome of the brain.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurolib-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;neurolib&lt;/a&gt; can load structural and functional data sets, set up a whole-brain model, manage its parameters, simulate it, and organize its outputs for later analysis.
The activity of each brain region can be converted into a simulated &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BOLD&lt;/span&gt; signal in order to calibrate the model to empirical data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
Extensive model analysis is possible using a parameter exploration module, which allows to characterize the model’s behaviour given a set of changing parameters.
An optimization module allows for fitting a model to multimodal empirical data using an evolutionary algorithm.
Besides its included functionality, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurolib-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;neurolib&lt;/a&gt; is designed to be extendable such that custom neural mass models can be implemented easily.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurolib-dev.github.io&quot;&gt;neurolib&lt;/a&gt; offers a versatile platform for computational neuroscientists for prototyping models, managing large numerical experiments, studying the structure-function relationship of brain networks, and for in-silico optimization of whole-brain models.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-us-life-expectancy-coronavirus-pandemic"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3096505</id>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Life expectancy in the United States plunged in the first half of 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A preliminary estimate of overall U.S. life expectancy from birth finds it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/VSRR10-508.pdf&quot;&gt;dropped a full year&lt;/a&gt; compared with 2019, from 78.8 to 77.8 years, the National Center for Health Statistics reports online February 18. It’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-visualization/mortality-trends/index.htm&quot;&gt;largest decline in life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; for the United States since the early 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When broken down by race and ethnicity, stark differences in the pandemic’s toll in the United States emerge. Life expectancy for Black people fell by 2.7 years, from 74.7 in 2019 to 72 in 2020. For Hispanic people, the drop was 1.9 years, from 81.8 to 79.9. White people experienced the smallest decline, from 78.8 to 78. As a result, the gap in life expectancy between Black and white populations in the United States grew to six years, a 46 percent increase from 2019, and the largest gap since 1998.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These racial and ethnic disparities reflect persistent structural inequalities that increase both the risk of exposure to the COVID virus and the risk of dying from COVID among those that are infected,” says Noreen Goldman, a demographer at Princeton University. Many Black and Latino Americans have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-pandemic-six-months-covid-19-symptoms&quot;&gt;worked in frontline jobs that can’t be done at home&lt;/a&gt; and are less likely than white Americans to have access to healthcare (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/2/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The new report’s preliminary estimates include deaths only through June. With the year-end surge in COVID-19 casualties, “I think — and fear — that the final estimate for the decline in life expectancy in 2020 will be non-trivially higher,” says Goldman. She and a colleague projected &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/5/e2014746118.long&quot;&gt;an overall drop in U.S. life expectancy in 2020 of 1.13 years&lt;/a&gt;, in a study published online February 2 in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, but she expects that is an underestimate as well. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of February 17, &lt;a href=&quot;https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html&quot;&gt;around 490,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the United States&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new estimate also does not fully account for drug overdose deaths, which have risen in 2020 according to provisional counts. Drug overdose deaths contributed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/us-life-expectancy-drops-second-year&quot;&gt;life expectancy declines&lt;/a&gt; at the scale of 0.1 and 0.2 years after 2014 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/21/17&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Goldman expects the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to affect life expectancy into 2021. The disease “is likely to have long-term, negative health impacts,” she says, and the social and economic effects of the pandemic “will almost certainly have a detrimental impact on health and survival for years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Some genetic variants inherited from Neandertals may protect against developing severe COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study looked at a stretch of DNA on chromosome 12 where a haplotype — a cluster of genetic variants that are inherited together — that affects susceptibility to the coronavirus is located. For each copy of the Neandertal haplotype a person inherited, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/9/e2026309118&quot;&gt;risk of needing intensive care fell approximately 22 percent&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report in the March 2 &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The variants may affect the activity or function of genes involved in a biochemical chain reaction that ends with the destruction of viral RNA, including the coronavirus’s. The protective variants are largely absent among people in sub-Saharan Africa, where few people carry genes inherited from Neandertals. About 25 to 30 percent of present-day people of Asian and European ancestry carry the protective variants. Some Black people in the Americas also inherited the protective haplotype, presumably from Asian, European or Native American ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previously, researchers had found that a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-neandertal-genes-risk-severe-infection&quot;&gt;different haplotype on chromosome 3&lt;/a&gt; that was inherited from Neandertals increases the risk of severe disease (&lt;em&gt;SN:10/2/20&lt;/em&gt;). The results show that genetic inheritance can help or hinder the immune response to disease.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The oldest DNA ever recovered from an animal is adding new chapters to mammoth life history, going back more than 1 million years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Genetic material from ancient mammoth molars found in Siberia handily beats the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-horses-dna-fills-picture-equine-evolution&quot;&gt;previous record set by 700,000-year-old DNA from a frozen, fossilized horse&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/26/13&lt;/em&gt;). Some mammoth gene snippets suggest that ancient mammoths already had the traits that allowed them to withstand cold temperatures during later ice ages. What’s more, some hairy behemoths that inhabited North America may have been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03224-9&quot;&gt;hybrid mix between the woolly mammoth and a previously unknown mammoth species&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report February 17 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings “really highlight the exciting times that we live in,” says Charlotte Lindqvist, an evolutionary biologist at the University at Buffalo in New York who was not involved in the work. “We can get genetic data — we can recover DNA — from such ancient samples that can directly give us windows into the past.” Such data can reveal how extinct animals evolved, adding to the clues that come from physically examining ancient bones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mammoth DNA was extracted from three molars unearthed in the 1970s from permafrost in northeast Siberia. Though DNA degrades into shorter strings of genetic material over time, making it difficult to handle and piece together, cold permafrost helps to protect genetic information from rapidly falling apart. Theoretical studies had suggested that researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2012.1745#d3e1957&quot;&gt;could perhaps recover DNA that is more than 1 million years old&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the recovered DNA is “quite close to the limit of what is possible,” says Love Dalén, an evolutionary geneticist at the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Stockholm.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The two oldest specimens, dubbed Krestovka and Adycha, lived around 1.2 million to 1 million years ago, Dalén and colleagues found. The third, called Chukochya, dates back 800,000 to 500,000 years. Genetic analyses of ancient DNA recovered from these specimens — as well as DNA from other mammoths and present-day elephants — suggest that Krestovka and Adycha belonged to two different mammoth species. Researchers had previously thought that only one type of mammoth, called the steppe mammoth (&lt;em&gt;Mammuthus trogontherii)&lt;/em&gt;, lived in Siberia 1 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Adycha was part of the steppe mammoth lineage that eventually gave rise to woolly mammoths, the Krestovka mammoth may have diverged from its relatives more than 2 million years ago and could represent an unknown line of mammoths, the researchers found. That unidentified species might have mixed with woolly mammoths to give rise to the Columbian mammoth (&lt;em&gt;M. columbi&lt;/em&gt;) — which roamed North America — at least 420,000 years ago. The younger Chukochya may have been an early woolly mammoth (&lt;em&gt;M. primigenius&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study adds to the amount of mammoth genetic material researchers have decoded and expands the geographic range where such mammoth samples have come from, says Vincent Lynch, an evolutionary biologist at the University at Buffalo, who was not involved in the work. Analyzing the genetics of many mammoths from varied locations is “important if you want to make statements about how mammoths came to be mammoths, why they look the way they do and how diverse they were,” Lynch says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traits such as shaggy hair, which probably helped mammoths &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-mammoths-loved-cold&quot;&gt;handle the cold&lt;/a&gt;, are ancient, the team found (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/2/15&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The Adycha and Chukochya mammoths already had the genetic tweaks for many of these traits, hinting that the hairy animals adapted slowly to the chill of ice ages over hundreds of thousands of years. “A lot of the mutations which we think make mammoths mammoths — small ears, lots of fat, not sensitive to cold — happened before they got into that environment,” Lynch says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, while the new results are intriguing, ancient DNA is fragile and there’s a limit to how much data researchers can get from old specimens, Lindqvist says. So the findings are unlikely to be the full story, she says.    &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<updated>2021-02-17T12:58:32+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Death can be a powerful narrative tool. We sob over the demise of a beloved character, cheer at the comeuppance of our favourite villain, or sit at the edge of our seats, shocked at deaths we didn’t see coming. Red Wedding, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All deaths are not created equal, however, and in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0030222820981236&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; Kaitlin Fitzgerald from the State University of New York and team look at what makes certain fictional deaths so memorable. The team reports that although we find some deaths &lt;em&gt;pleasurable&lt;/em&gt; — the long-awaited downfall of an antagonist, for example — it’s those we find &lt;em&gt;meaningful&lt;/em&gt; that truly stick with us in the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41392&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were first asked to think of a death scene from a narrative — film, TV, or other media. Those in the control condition then wrote about why the death they’d thought of was particularly memorable, while the other two groups were asked specifically to recall a death that was  particularly “meaningful” or “pleasurable” and write about why they found it to be that way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After writing about the scene, participants categorised the genre of the narrative they’d chosen, and indicated which emotions they felt in response to the scene. They also rated the extent to which they appreciated the narrative (how meaningful, moving or thought provoking they found it) and enjoyed it (how fun or entertaining it was, and whether they’d had a good time engaging with it). Finally, participants categorised the character as a hero, villain, anti-hero or anti-villain, rated the morality of the character and how much they deserved their death, and indicated how much they liked the character.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results showed that “meaningful” and “pleasurable” deaths in fiction differ in key ways. Participants who had recalled a meaningful death were more likely to &lt;em&gt;appreciate&lt;/em&gt; the narratives than those in the pleasurable condition, who were more likely to &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; them. Those in the meaningful condition were also more likely to pick narratives from dramas or tear-jerkers, while participants in the pleasurable condition were more likely to pick deaths from the action genre, or from horrors or thrillers. The death of characters seen as moral, as heroes, or as less deserving of death were also more likely to be picked by those in the meaningful condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The relationship between morality and appreciation could be explored further, however. While the results suggest that the deaths of immoral characters are generally considered less meaningful, what about those whose morality is somewhat more blurred? Co-author Matthew Grizzard &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.osu.edu/in-fiction-we-remember-the-deaths-that-make-us-sad/&quot;&gt;noted in an interview&lt;/a&gt; that, though both could very reasonably be considered villains, &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt;’s Roy Batty and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars’&lt;/em&gt; Darth Vader had come up several times as examples of meaningful deaths due to their redemption arcs. These moral grey areas could be explored further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, the study indicates that even when we’re watching a film or reading a book we can experience death as a meaningful and reflective experience. In particular, the team suggests that media deaths can help people process “disenfranchised” grief — grief for someone they don’t feel “allowed” to grieve for — with fictional characters acting as a conduit for repressed feelings. So while it might be fun when a schlocky Bond villain &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/8JbGpHY0izA?t=48&quot;&gt;falls from the top of the Golden Gate Bridge&lt;/a&gt; or Samuel L. Jackson &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz1J9PUcMQ0&quot;&gt;gets eaten by a shark&lt;/a&gt;, there are scores of other examples that speak to people on a level that goes far beyond entertainment, and that may even help them understand their own grief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0030222820981236&quot;&gt;Memorable, Meaningful, Pleasurable: An Exploratory Examination of Narrative Character Deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The NASA Perseverance rover has landed. “Touchdown confirmed! Perseverance is safely on the surface of Mars, ready to begin seeking the signs of past life,” NASA engineer Swati Mohan said during a Feb. 18 livestream of the landing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Perseverance team released some of the first images from the landing during a news briefing on February 19, including pictures of the Martian surface, the rover dangling below its landing gear and an action shot from another spacecraft orbiting Mars. This is the beginning of Perseverance’s mission to explore an ancient river delta called Jezero crater, searching for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-instruments-life&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;signs of ancient life&lt;/a&gt; and collecting rocks for a future mission to return to Earth (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/28/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team released the first color image from Perseverance during the Feb. 19 briefing. “As soon as we got that color image, our chats just lit up with the scientists saying, look over here! Look over here!” said deputy project scientist Katie Stack Morgan. “We’re really doing science now on the surface of Mars.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;color image of the martian surface&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096581&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mars_Rover_realcolor.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096581&quot;&gt;This is the first color image Perseverance took on the surface of Mars. The image is from the rover’s hazard-avoidance camera after the rover removed a protective dust cover.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096581&quot;&gt;JPL-CALTECH/NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rover &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mission-mars-launch&quot;&gt;caps off a month of Mars&lt;/a&gt; arrivals from space agencies around the world (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/30/20&lt;/em&gt;). Perseverance joins Hope, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emiratesmarsmission.ae/&quot;&gt;first interplanetary mission from the United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt;, which successfully entered Mars orbit on February 9; and Tianwen-1, China’s first Mars mission, which arrived on February 10 and will deploy a rover to the Martian surface in May.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;black and white image of the martian surface from perseverance rover&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096551&quot; height=&quot;510&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021820_lg_perseverance_firstimage-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096551&quot;&gt;NASA’s Perseverance rover sent back this image of its landing spot on Mars after touchdown. The image was taken with one of the rover’s hazard cameras, which is partially obscured by a dust cover.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096551&quot;&gt;JPL-Caltech/NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NASA &lt;a href=&quot;https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/timeline/landing/watch-online/&quot;&gt;broadcast Perseverance’s landing on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; starting at 2:15 p.m. EST, with the moment of touchdown at approximately 3:55 p.m. on February 18. The rover used the landing system pioneered by its predecessor, Curiosity, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/curiosity-lands-safely-mars?mode=pick&amp;amp;context=118&quot;&gt;which has been exploring Mars since 2012&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/6/12&lt;/em&gt;). But in a first for Mars touchdowns, this rover recorded its own landing with dedicated cameras and a microphone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096583&quot; height=&quot;807&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Percy_with_shoot.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;1434&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096583&quot;&gt;The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter caught this image of Perseverance falling to the surface of the Red Planet, slowed by a parachute. The background shows an ancient river delta in Jezero crater, where scientists hope to find signs of past life on Mars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096583&quot;&gt;JPL-CALTECH/NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the craft carrying Perseverance zoomed through the thin Martian atmosphere, three cameras looked up at the parachute slowing it down from supersonic speeds. When a rocket-powered “sky crane” platform lowered the rover to the ground, a fourth camera on the platform recorded the rover’s descent. Another camera on the rover looked back up at the platform, and a sixth camera looked at the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

The landing involves dangling the rover from a floating platform on cables and touching down directly on its wheels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096460&quot;&gt;JPL-Caltech/NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;diagram of Perseverance rover landing plan&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096459&quot; height=&quot;415&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021621_lg_perseverance_inline1_mobile_rev.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096459&quot;&gt;Perseverance will use the “sky crane” landing system pioneered by its predecessor, Curiosity.

&lt;p&gt;“The goal is to see the video and the action of getting from high up in the atmosphere down to the surface,” says engineer David Gruel of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, who was the engineering lead for that six-camera system, called EDL-Cam. He hopes every engineer on the team has an image of the rover hanging below the descent stage as their computer desktop background six months from now. One of the images released February 19 could make that possible. The image shows the rover hanging from the sky crane platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image of rover dangling above Mars surface&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096582&quot; height=&quot;1536&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rover_dangling.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096582&quot;&gt;This image shows Perseverance dangling below the sky crane platform, which was hovering above Mars’ surface using rockets like a jetpack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096582&quot;&gt;JPL-CALTECH/NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we first saw this image, it was exhilarating,” said strategic mission manager Pauline Hwang during the Feb. 19 press briefing. “The team went wild.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because it will take more than 11 minutes for signals to travel between Earth and Mars, the cameras didn’t stream the landing movie in real time. And after Perseverance landed, engineers were focused on making sure the rover is healthy and able to collect science data, so the landing videos weren’t among the first data sent back. Gruel expects to be able to share what the rover saw four days after landing, on February 22.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Perseverance also carries microphones to record first-ever audio of a Mars landing. Unlike the landing cameras, the microphones will continue to work after touchdown, hopefully helping the engineering team keep track of the rover’s health. Motors sound different when they get clogged with dust, for instance, Gruel says. The team will hear the sound of the rover’s wheels crunching across the Martian surface, and maybe the sound of the wind blowing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Are we going to hear a dust devil? What might a dust devil sound like? Could we hear rocks rolling down a hill?” Gruel asks. “You never know what we might stumble onto.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sound will add a way to share Mars with people who have trouble seeing, Gruel notes. “It might appeal to a whole other element of the population who might not have been able to experience past missions the same way,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Watch NASA’s coverage of the Perseverance landing here.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere on Mars, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-nasa-insight-lander-learned-about-mars-magnetism-quakes&quot;&gt;InSight lander&lt;/a&gt; will be listening to the landing too (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/24/20&lt;/em&gt;). The lander’s seismometer &lt;a href=&quot;https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/1862/&quot;&gt;may be able to feel vibrations&lt;/a&gt; when two tungsten weights that Perseverance carried to Mars for stability smack into the ground before the rover lands, geophysicist Benjamin Fernando of the University of Oxford and colleagues report in a paper posted December 3 to eartharxiv.org and submitted to &lt;em&gt;JGR Planets&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“No one’s ever tried to do this before,” Fernando says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ground will move by at most 0.1 nanometers per second, Fernando and colleagues calculated. “It’s incredibly small,” he says. “But the seismometer is also incredibly sensitive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team may be able to catch that tiny signal because they know exactly when and where the impact will happen. If the lander does pick up the signal, it will tell scientists something about how fast seismic waves travel through the ground, a clue to the details of Mars’ interior structure. And even if they don’t feel anything, that will put limits on the waves’ speed. “It still teaches us something,” Fernando says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The InSight team hopes to also feel vibrations from Tianwen-1 when its rover touches down in May. “Detecting one would be great,” Fernando says. “Detecting two would be like, amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;It was a cold, overcast Saturday morning in Salem, Ore., when Jesse Laney set out to catch a glimpse of a painted bunting. He’d heard earlier that week through a birding WhatsApp group that this vibrant, rainbow-colored bird was in the area. Painted buntings (&lt;em&gt;Passerina ciris&lt;/em&gt;) are common in places like Texas and the northern parts of Mexico, but a rarity in Oregon. Laney and his sons raced to the site and began searching — but the bird eluded them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He wasn’t too disappointed, though. Just the chance of seeing a rare bird “scratches the ever-present itch of participating in a small bit of discovery,” says Laney, an ecologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That itch has now inspired research debunking a popular myth among birders: That a rare bird sighting leads to more sightings of other rare bird species because birders flock to an area to find the initial bird. This phenomenon is called the Patagonia Picnic Table Effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Common crane in Oregon&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096450&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021221_AD_birding_inline-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096450&quot;&gt;Common crane (&lt;em&gt;Grus grus&lt;/em&gt;) sightings are rare in the Pacific Northwest. In 2020, ecologist Jesse Laney spotted one in Northern California.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096450&quot;&gt;Thomas Landgren/Flickr (&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/&quot;&gt;CC BY-NC-ND 2.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Its origin story dates back to sometime in the 1960s or ‘70s. Though details are a bit unclear, birders saw a rare black-capped gnatcatcher, or a pair of rose-throated becards, in Patagonia, a town near the Arizona-Mexico border. Word got around and birders descended on the town, which led to sightings of other rare birds, including a five-striped sparrow and a yellow grosbeak, according to some accounts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To determine if such discovery bonanzas are one-off events or a common occurrence, Laney and his colleagues analyzed data from 2008 to 2017 from the online database eBird. Avid birders typically upload their checklists — that is, birds they have spotted on an outing — to the site.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The team identified 273 so-called mega-rarities mostly in the continental United States; these are the hardest-to-find birds, either because there are so few of them or because they rarely show up in some geographical locations. The researchers then evaluated rare bird discovery rates before and after crowds raced to where those ultra-uncommon birds were spotted.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The rates remained essentially the same, the team reports January 21 in &lt;em&gt;PeerJ,&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10713&quot;&gt;8 detections per 1,000 checklists&lt;/a&gt;. Birders had no better chance of finding a second species of rare bird in an area where there was a recent rare bird sighting than they did during routine birding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This belief that one success can lead to more isn’t limited to the birding community. When an athlete magically makes one shot after another, that streak is referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/big-score-hot-hand&quot;&gt;the hot hand effect&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/12/12&lt;/em&gt;). We want to believe such patterns exist, says Andreas Wilke, a psychologist at Clarkson University in Potsdam, N.Y. That thinking once gave humans an evolutionary advantage when it came to such survival skills as finding food, he says. “It’s a very adaptive thing to do but it can misfire in modern environments when we look at very random distributions of things and start to see patterns that don’t exist.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Middle Eastern hunter-gatherers changed their relationship with the dead nearly 20,000 years ago. Clues to that spiritual shift come from the discovery of an ancient woman’s fiery burial in a hut at a seasonal campsite.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Burials of people in houses or other structures, as well as cremations, are thought to have originated in Neolithic-period farming villages in and around the Middle East no earlier than about 10,000 years ago. But those treatments of the dead appear to have had roots in long-standing practices of hunter-gatherers, says a team led by archaeologists Lisa Maher of the University of California, Berkeley and Danielle Macdonald of the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new find suggests that people started to associate the dead with particular structures at a time when groups of hunter-gatherers were camping for part of each year at a hunting and trading site in eastern Jordan. A budding desire &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S027841652030235X&quot;&gt;to link the dead with human-built structures&lt;/a&gt; possibly reflected a belief that by doing so the dead would remain close to the living, the scientists report in the March &lt;em&gt;Journal of Anthropological Archaeology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Excavations at the ancient site, now called Kharaneh IV, in 2016 revealed a woman’s partial, charred skeleton on the floor of a hut that had been lit on fire. Her body had been placed on its side with knees flexed. Analyses of charring patterns on her bones and burned sediment surrounding her remains suggest the woman’s body was placed inside the hut just before the brushwood structure was intentionally burned. Charcoal- and ash-rich sediment borders where the hut once stood, a sign that the fire was confined to the structure. The hut’s walls apparently fell inward after being set ablaze.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Radiocarbon-dated samples from the earthen floor near the woman’s remains date her interment to around 19,200 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several Neolithic sites contain examples of the dead having been placed in or under burned houses, as well as instances of bodies that were intentionally burned after death, says archaeologist Peter Akkermans of Leiden University, who did not participate in the new research. “The work at Kharaneh IV now dates these practices to more than 10,000 years earlier, in wholly different cultural settings of hunter-gatherer communities versus Neolithic farming villages.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other social developments traditionally attributed to Neolithic farmers, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/big-eats-12000-year-old-burial&quot;&gt;year-round settlements&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/30/10&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-pottery-comes-chinese-cave&quot;&gt;pottery making&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/28/12&lt;/em&gt;), first appeared among hunter-gatherers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remains of at least three other huts have been found at Kharaneh IV, including one with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shelters-date-stone-age&quot;&gt;graves beneath the floor that contained two human skeletons&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/22/12&lt;/em&gt;). That roughly 19,400-year-old hut was also burned down, possibly when the site’s occupants stopped using it but not as part of a human burial event.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new discovery at Kharaneh IV “links the death of a person and the destruction or death of a building as part of a funerary rite,” Maher says. Perhaps the hut was where the woman or her family lived, or perhaps she died there and the structure was deemed off-limits, she suggests. Either way, Kharaneh IV was occupied for several generations after the woman’s death, until roughly 18,600 years ago, so establishing a permanent place for her may have been considered important.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanings and beliefs that Kharaneh IV residents attributed to burning a hut in which a dead woman’s body had been placed are still a mystery, Maher says. The use of fire in that event might have signified some type of transformation, rebirth, cleansing or life-and-death cycle, she suggests.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/16/we-prefer-to-experience-good-and-bad-events-on-the-same-day-as-a-friend/"/>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You rub off the panels on a scratch card and find that you’re the lucky winner of £100. If you could choose when the same thing should happen to a good friend, would you rather it was the same day as your win — or a different day? And what if we’re talking negative, rather than positive, experiences — when you’ve both been issued with parking tickets, say, or both suffered a bereavement?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier work shows that we tend to prefer to get through a series of negative experiences as quickly as possible, while we like to space out multiple personal positive experiences, so as to receive the most pleasure from each joy. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550620976421&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/em&gt; finds that when we’re thinking about shared experiences, though, this doesn’t hold. The participants in this study preferred to experience both negative and positive events on the same day as a friend, rather than on different days — as long as those events weren’t powerfully emotional. Franklin Shaddy at the University of California, Los Angeles and his colleagues think we have this “preference for integration” because it increases our feelings of connection with others. This could have implications for how we arrange our lives during lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41385&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first of five studies, the team found that the vast majority of a group of student participants wanted to receive a surprise friendly message (in this case from the head coach of UCLA’s basketball team) on the same day as a friend, rather than a different day. In a second study, the majority of 304 online participants said that they’d feel happier about winning a moderate amount of money on a lottery — or being issued with a tax demand for a similar amount — if a similar financial win or loss happened to a friend on the same day than if it happened on another day shortly before or afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In further studies, the researchers found that people preferred to “integrate” — or “coordinate” — an event such as receiving a first-class flight upgrade or missing a flight with someone whom they liked. But when it came to someone they didn’t like, they had no strong feelings about the timing of the event. The same was true for another group of participants who were asked to think of imaginary people who they were told had similar political beliefs to their own, or opposite beliefs. The team thinks that people like the idea of coordinating positive or negative experiences with friends (or people they think they would get on with) because they feel that this will boost their feelings of social connection with the other person.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However a final study found that there are limits to this preference for integration: we prefer more extreme wins — and especially losses (such as getting divorced or totalling a car) — not to happen at the same time to us as to a friend. The team interpret this as reflecting a limited human capacity to savour gains and buffer losses, with shared extreme losses being harder to handle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are other potential interpretations of the results, though. If you won money, might you worry that telling a friend could make them a little jealous, or even resentful or self-pitying — or might you even feel guilty about your own good luck? How much better it would be, then, for you both to win money on the same day. Also, we could be averse to experiencing strongly upsetting events on the same day as a friend simply because a friend who’s also suffering is less likely to be able to help us to cope with our own distress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, there are potential practical implications of the finding that we prefer to share experience of pleasant events. “Past research has shown that people underestimate their enjoyment of, and thus hesitate to engage in, hedonic activities alone,” the team writes. That resistance might be overcome if we were to share a positive experience with someone else if not in space, at least in time. During lockdown, we can’t meet a group of friends to go for a walk in a pleasant spot near our home, for example — but a group of friends could arrange to go individually for a walk in different uplifting places at the same time, and hopefully benefit from the feeling of enhanced social connection that this could bring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550620976421&quot;&gt;Social Hedonic Editing: People Prefer to Experience Events at the Same Time as Others&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Cotton plants native to Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula may all look the same — unkempt and untamed bushes with flowers that shift from pale yellow to violet as pollinators visit them. But genes that have escaped from genetically modified cotton crops have made some of these native plants fundamentally different, changing their biology and the way they interact with insects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One type of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81567-z&quot;&gt;escaped gene&lt;/a&gt; makes wild cotton exude less nectar. With no means to attract defensive ants that protect it from plant eaters, the cotton is devoured. Another escaped gene makes the wild cotton produce excess nectar, enticing a lot of ants that might keep other insects, including pollinators, at bay, researchers report on January 21 in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These are profoundly interesting effects,” says Norman Ellstrand, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Riverside. “It’s the first case that really suggests that a whole ecosystem can be disrupted” after transgenes enter a wild population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results challenge one long-held view that when genes from genetically modified crops escape into the wild, they have only a neutral effect on wild plants or pass on their benefits to weeds, says Alicia Mastretta Yanes, a plant molecular ecologist at the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity in Mexico City. The findings confirm that unexpected outcomes of this genetic transfer, some of which “were never imagined, or at least were not assumed as possible,” do happen sometimes, she says.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Scientists have previously tried to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gmos-havent-delivered-their-promises-or-risks&quot;&gt;explain what happens&lt;/a&gt; after DNA from genetically modified crops ends up in their wild relatives (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/29/16&lt;/em&gt;). But the majority of studies have been done under carefully controlled conditions, and very few have tested the consequences, if any, of these gene transfers on natural ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scarce evidence motivated Ana Wegier, a plant geneticist from the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City, and her students to find out. The country was their natural lab. The cotton we know (&lt;em&gt;Gossypium hirsutum&lt;/em&gt;) first appeared and diversified between 2 million and 1.5 million years ago in Mexico, and native variants still sprout across the land. In the last 25 years, vast fields of fluffy genetically engineered cotton have also cropped up across the northern part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During that time, Wegier has explored Mexico searching for wild cotton, only to find it at the edge of cliffs, municipal dumps or the middle of a highway. Wild cotton likes to grow in the most inhospitable locations, where it does not have to compete with other species, she says. In 2018, Wegier and her group traveled to the Ría Lagartos biosphere reserve, an isolated coastal area in the Yucatan Peninsula. With the whitest beaches just a few feet away, the researchers spent long days observing and sampling cotton plants under the scorching sun as swarms of mosquitoes bit them nonstop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;ants on a white cotton plant flower&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096382&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/020521_erm_transgene-cotton_inline1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096382&quot;&gt;Ants patrol the flower of this cotton plant, warding off herbivores from devouring it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096382&quot;&gt;Valeria Vázquez Barrios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back in Wegier’s city lab, the team extracted DNA from the 61 plants it had collected and found that 24 of the plants did not have any transgenes. Twenty-one plants had a transgene that conferred resistance to the herbicide glyphosate; seven could now produce a lethal toxin that kills destructive insects; and the remaining nine had incorporated both escaped genes into their genetic code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the closest fields of genetically engineered cotton nearly 2,000 kilometers away, “what surprised me the most was how easy it was to find changes where we didn’t expect them,” Wegier says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When slathered in a stress-inducing chemical, the plants with glyphosate resistance produced a lot less nectar than wild plants. The nectar is a sugary snack that wild cotton secretes whenever it’s eaten in exchange for the bodyguard services of particularly aggressive ant species. These plants were also the ones that looked the most ragged before the samples were taken. With no tasty reward to offer, and no ants to protect the cotton from hungry herbivores, these plants suffered the most damage compared with native plants that didn’t have the transgene.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Treated with the same chemical, the plants with the insecticide gene exuded nectar all the time, secreting more than the wild plants with no escaped genes and becoming an irresistible beacon to protective ants. But in the researchers’ sample of plants, there weren’t as many with the insecticide gene, suggesting that either the ants or the transgene itself were scaring off other insects. That may have interfered with the pollination of the cotton’s flowers, preventing the plant from reproducing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings are intriguing, says Hugo Perales, an agroecologist at the Colegio de la Frontera Sur in Chiapas, Mexico, but he urges for caution. The uncontrollable, real-world environment of Ría Lagartos forced the researchers to work with a very small number of plants, he says. “There’s a suggestion that something is happening, but this suggestion needs to be verified.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To Wegier, the implications of the study are clear. With Mexico being the reservoir of cotton’s genetic diversity, she argues it would be wise to limit the introduction of more genetically modified variants. “We know the presence of transgenes is irreversible, and the [ecological] effects are irreversible,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Harold “Skip” Garner has worn many hats over the course of his career, including plasma physicist, biologist, and administrator. One of his interests is plagiarism and duplication the scientific literature, and he and colleagues developed a tool called eTBLAST that compares text passages to what has already been published to flag potential overlap.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Uppsala University and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced two 3-year publishing agreements that allow researchers to publish in PLOS journals without incurring article processing charges (APC). The Community Action Publishing (CAP) agreement enables Uppsala University researchers to publish fee-free in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; PLOS&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Biology. &lt;/em&gt;The Flat fee agreement also allows them to publish in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; and PLOS’ community journals&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. These models shift publishing costs from authors to research institutions based on prior publishing history and anticipated future growth with PLOS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are thrilled to be collaborating with Uppsala University, our first European flat fee customer, on two new models that allow Uppsala researchers to publish without APCs,” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS.  “As one of the most prestigious university’s in the world, Uppsala is well-positioned to further the cause of equitable and barrier free open reading and publishing and we are delighted to join with them on this effort.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS’ Community Action Publishing (CAP) is PLOS’ effort to sustain highly selective journal publishing without Article Processing Charges for authors. More details about the model can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/publish/publishing-faqs/#plos-community-action-publishing&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; PLOS’ Flat Fee model enables APC-free publishing with PLOS’ other five journals creating efficiency and reducing administrative overhead for managing gold APC funds. Uppsala University and PLOS will also collaborate on future data, metrics, and tools for institutions to evaluate Open Access publishing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Uppsala University publishing deal continues the momentum for PLOS, following other agreements with the University of California system, Big Ten Academic Alliance, Jisc (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester) and the Canadian Research Knowledge Network among others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class=&quot;has-normal-font-size&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-normal-font-size&quot;&gt;Though girls and boys do equally well on maths tests, the stereotype that girls aren’t as naturally able at maths — or as likely to be extremely smart — is adopted early; even 6-year-olds in the US endorse it. Of course, these stereotypes harm women in an educational setting and in their professional lives, point out the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-99409-003&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Developmental Psychology&lt;/em&gt;. So it’s important to understand what gives rise to them. Eleanor Chestnut at Stanford University and her colleagues now report that one common and well-intentioned way of attempting to convey girls’ equality with boys actually backfires: saying that girls are “just as good” as boys at something leads the listener to conclude that boys are naturally better, and girls must work harder to equal them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41375&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-normal-font-size&quot;&gt;Earlier work has shown that we use the syntax of a sentence to make inferences about the relative status of objects and social groups. Typically, we view the thing or person that is being compared to as the more typical or superior reference example. So, if you were to read “Molly’s cake is as good as Jessica’s”, you’d be likely to infer that Jessica’s is the exemplar that Molly is striving to equal. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-normal-font-size&quot;&gt;“Girls are just as good at boys at maths” is something that family members, caregivers, teachers and public figures all say to try to promote gender equality, note the researchers. And in 2018, Chestnut and her colleague Ellen M Markman reported that &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1111/cogs.12637&quot;&gt;adults who hear that statement infer that boys are more skilled at maths and have more natural ability&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, then, it seems to perpetuate the very stereotype that it seeks to counteract. In the new study, the team set out to discover whether stereotypes can not only be perpetuated but learned, based on syntax alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-normal-font-size&quot;&gt;First, the team studied 288 adults, who were recruited online. These participants read sentences that incorporated nonsense words for abilities or traits. The team found that people who read that girls are “as good as boys” at “thrupping”, say, or “trewting”, inferred more natural skill to the boys, and that girls had to work harder to be “trewtic”, and so on. When the boys were reported to be “as good as girls”, though, the &lt;em&gt;girls &lt;/em&gt;were perceived to be superior — showing the influence of syntax in the participant’s judgements. When the sentence read, “Suppose someone tells you that boys and girls [or girls and boys] are equally good at thrupping”, and so on, neither gender was perceived to be naturally superior. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-normal-font-size&quot;&gt;The team then ran a similar study with 337 children, aged 7 to 11, who were recruited from museums in the San Francisco Bay area. This time, the researchers used puppets (who said they wanted to tell the children about boys and girls on their planet) as well as written statements. And instead of using nonsense words, the researchers referred to activities that the children would understand but which the team didn’t think they’d have a strong pre-existing gender bias about — whistling, hopping on one foot, doing handstands and snapping.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-normal-font-size&quot;&gt;When these children were told that boys [or girls] are “as good as” girls [or boys] at one of these things, the children more likely to report that the gender in the reference position, at the end of the sentence, was naturally better, and would have to work less hard to be skilled at it. Also in line with the findings from adults, when the boys and girls on the alien planet were presented as being “equally as good” at an activity, the children didn’t view either gender as being naturally superior. The children’s age made no difference; they all made similar inferences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-normal-font-size&quot;&gt;“We conclude that is critically important to consider how we frame equality when talking to children,” the researchers write. The work suggests that if a child does not already hold the stereotype that boys are better than girls at maths, or more likely to be extremely smart, hearing that girls are “as good as boys” in these spheres could actually teach it. Public figures, websites, statements on Twitter, and even psychological research articles readily equate girls’ abilities with boys’ or women’s with men’s, the team notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-normal-font-size&quot;&gt;Their work suggests that presenting girls and boys, and men and women, as being “equally as good” at something is a far better strategy. “Until women and men are on equal syntactic footing, they will not be on equal social footing,” they conclude. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-99409-003&quot;&gt;“Just as good”: Learning gender stereotypes from attempts to counteract them.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/social-distancing-boredom-covid-19-public-health-pandemic"/>

		<updated>2021-02-15T11:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;In recent months, journalists and public health experts have bandied about the term “pandemic fatigue.” Though not clearly defined, the general gist is that people have grown tired of the pandemic and keeping apart for almost a year and running. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hot-thought/202011/what-is-covid-fatigue&quot;&gt;That fatigue&lt;/a&gt; can manifest as feelings of anxiety, hopelessness, frustration, anger and boredom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seeing boredom on that list worries those who study the phenomenon. “Usually boredom tells you that you should do something else,” says sports psychologist Wanja Wolff of the University of Konstanz in Germany. “In the context of a pandemic … that might not be the best thing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recently, those fears have received more traction. Two similar yet independent studies, one by Wolff and colleagues and another by a U.S.-Canadian research team, found that people who frequently feel bored are more likely than others to flout social distancing guidelines. Those boredom-prone individuals also appear to be at higher risk of contracting the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boredom, these studies suggest, may well constitute a real, yet underappreciated, public health threat.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;Defining boredom&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across the Western humanities, boredom has typically been depicted as an individual failing. The 19th century German pessimist Arthur Schopenhauer defined boredom as the sensation of the emptiness of existence. French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre called it a “leprosy of the soul.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But researchers studying boredom say it merits a more neutral reading. That feeling of having nothing to do — what Russian author Leo Tolstoy called “the desire for desires” — serves as a signal, a call to the body to shift gears, goes the current thinking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Boredom is a sign that you’re not meaningfully engaged in the world,” says social psychologist Erin Westgate of the University of Florida in Gainesville. Researchers, including Westgate, have identified two paths to boredom: a loss of focus or a loss of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Certainly, many of us have lost the focus, or mental acuity, of the Before Times, Westgate says. In addition to a deadly pandemic that has brought city shutdowns and remote schooling, there have been civil rights protests, political unrest, a crippling recession and myriad other stressors both big and small. Those disturbances, which hobble our ability to stay mentally sharp, can lead to dullness. When boredom is defined this way, the busyness of, say, parents of young children provides little protection against feeling blah. In fact, Westgate and others have found that both understimulation and overstimulation can &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-30815-001&quot;&gt;short-circuit one’s ability to pay attention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, many of our lives have come unraveled. Research by personality and social psychologist Samantha Heintzelman of Rutgers University-Newark in New Jersey shows that simple routines, like getting coffee from the same café every day or a standing lunch date with a friend, actually&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167218795133&quot;&gt; imbue life with meaning&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re in a collective loss of routine right now,” Heintzelman says. That is to say, the social distancing guidelines aimed at protecting us from a deadly disease have also stolen the seemingly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rituals-religion-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic&quot;&gt;little things that give life meaning&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/14/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When people lose both focus and meaning in their lives, this form of boredom is “doubly bad,” Westgate says. “You can be bored because something is meaningful, but you can’t pay attention because it’s too easy or too hard. You can also be bored because you can pay attention, but it’s meaningless,” she says. “But if something is meaningless and you can’t pay attention, you’re like double bored.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Prone to the blahs&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those two new boredom studies — each including almost 1,000 North American participants — show how elevated boredom levels among those prone to the feeling may be playing out during this pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the study by the U.S.-Canadian team, researchers sought to quantify the link between a person’s innate propensity for boredom and rule-breaking behaviors during the pandemic, such as spending fewer hours apart from others or holding a social gathering. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019188692030578X&quot;&gt;Boredom proneness across the sample explained 25 percent of the variance in rule-breaking behaviors&lt;/a&gt;, the team reports in the March&lt;em&gt; Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/em&gt;. The researchers did not find a strong relationship between rule-breaking and other factors that might influence it, such as age or gender. (Young adults and men tend to score higher on boredom than other groups.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Social distancing struggles&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a recent study, individuals who scored high on a five-point scale of proneness to boredom and relatively low on a five-point scale of self-control typically found it more difficult to adhere to social distancing guidelines (larger circles) than others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h6 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;Relationship between boredom proneness, self-control and difficulty adhering to social distancing measures&lt;/h6&gt;

Wolff et al/ Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/&quot;&gt;CC BY 4.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;graph showing overlap in boredom proneness, self-control and difficulty adhering to social distancing measures&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096364&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/012821_SG_pandemic-boredom_inline1_mobile.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096364&quot;&gt;W.

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No single factor can explain 100 percent of any human behavior, says study coauthor and cognitive neuroscientist James Danckert of the University of Waterloo in Canada. But “25 percent is a huge amount.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wolff and colleagues, whose findings appeared online July 28 in the &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/15/5420&quot;&gt;boredom-prone people ranked social distancing as more difficult&lt;/a&gt; than others did, and were less likely to adhere to social distancing guidelines. Both teams showed that those who scored higher in boredom were also slightly more likely than those scoring lower to report having gotten COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Boredom is an incredibly powerful motivator for behavior,” Wolff says. Yet, he adds, people can struggle with how to respond to that signal in safe and meaningful ways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;The danger of the doldrums&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Westgate is not surprised that people who are especially prone to boredom, yet able to socially distance, find staying home mind-numbingly dull. She does wonder, though, about the rest of us: How are people who aren’t used to being bored contending with the loss of focus and meaning brought on by the pandemic? Are they also breaking the rules?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research here is less direct but suggestive. In a 2014 study in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, Westgate and colleagues asked 42 undergraduate students to sit alone with their thoughts for several minutes, no cell phones allowed. The students, though, had the option to push a button to receive a painful electric shock. About &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6192/75.abstract&quot;&gt;two-thirds of the male and a quarter of the female students&lt;/a&gt; pushed that button, some repeatedly, suggesting that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/people-will-take-pain-over-being-left-alone-their-thoughts&quot;&gt;even pain can be preferable to boredom&lt;/a&gt; for some (&lt;em&gt;SN: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;7/3/14&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a 2019 study in &lt;em&gt;Behavioral Decision Making&lt;/em&gt; by social psychologist Wijnand Van Tilburg and colleagues showed that inducing boredom in people through a repetitive gambling game prompted them to &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bdm.2160&quot;&gt;make riskier decisions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Momentary boredom is not inherently bad, says Van Tilburg, of the University of Essex in England. But over a longer period, boredom can lead to serious public health outcomes if the situation “is unresolved or the resolution to it is harmful, like overeating or becoming aggressive or not wearing a mask,” he says.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recent study provides clues to how unresolved boredom may be playing out. Most epidemiological models assume that people will start and maintain social distancing as soon as COVID-19 cases begin going up in an area. That would cause deaths, which lag cases by a few weeks, to spike but then plummet in response to the social distancing — causing the model forecasts of deaths to resemble a mountain with a sharp peak.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But researchers reporting in the Dec. 22 &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences &lt;/em&gt;found, based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/&quot;&gt;Google’s COVID-19 Mobility Reports&lt;/a&gt;,that in most U.S. states, people did initially hunker down as cases rose in the spring and summer, but then increased their movements before the threat had passed. As a result, true curves of COVID-19 fatalities &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/117/51/32764.abstract&quot;&gt;resemble not a peak but plateaus or short dips followed by a rapid increase&lt;/a&gt;. That is, death rates did not plummet as expected but remained high. When the researchers incorporated that premature resurgence of activity into epidemiological models, the predicted curves better replicated real-life fatality patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors attribute people’s actions, and the higher-than-expected death toll, to pandemic fatigue, which includes boredom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the coming months, boredom from pandemic fatigue may well intensify. The spread of the coronavirus, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-uk-variant-more-contagious-us-dominant-strain&quot;&gt;new and even more contagious variants&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/15/21&lt;/em&gt;), in the United States and many other places continues to spiral out of control. Though hope is at hand with the rollout of vaccines, public health experts warn that vaccinating enough people to halt the virus’ spread in the United States could take us well into 2021. What is that collision of hope and despair doing to our levels of boredom? How many of us will drop our guard?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;What now?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wolff is now investigating how to help those experiencing boredom follow social distancing rules. His July paper showed that when boredom-prone people exhibit high self-control, they do a better job with adherence. Training people to have more self-control may be difficult though, Wolff says. Instead, he suggests that people reduce the need for self-control by creating contingency plans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His preliminary research, posted online June 25 at PsyArXiv.com, suggests that such “if-then” plans can help. For instance, if an indoor gym is too dangerous, a person could instead plan to start running outside. Wolff suggests people take small steps to make it easier to follow such a change in routine, such as putting workout clothes out on the bed the night before and sneakers by the front door. “The idea is to make behavior more automatic,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But even with the best-laid plans, retaining focus and meaning during the pandemic is no easy task. Researchers say it’s worth reminding ourselves that boredom is a neutral signal, neither bad nor good. And some people who hunker down right now and explore that feeling may discover that the boredom has deeper roots that may even predate the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So perhaps the most optimistic framing of the situation is that some people will use this protracted moment of boredom to think about larger life goals, Van Tilburg says. “It is possible to get meaning out of these negative situations.”  &lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;One way to think of culture is as a context in which we learn and develop. We share, live, perform, and experience culture through our participation in daily activities, customs, and routines with social others. Culture helps us make sense of our social worlds and shapes our actions, thoughts, and feelings. For example, culture plays a role in the way we experience emotions, construct our self-concepts, and learn and problem-solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With increasing migration and the movement of people in the twenty-first century, many children in the US and worldwide are attending school in formal settings where cultural norms and practices at home may conflict with those children encounter at school. This experience places children in the position of having to navigate two different social worlds—home and school. One broad question we can explore is: “what role does culture play in shaping children’s school experiences and academic success?” Let’s visit three specific areas: parental beliefs and socialization practices, teacher perceptions, and school curricula and children’s learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Parental beliefs and socialization practices&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parental expectations, beliefs, and attitudes about education shape children’s academic experiences. Many parents in diverse cultural communities view education as a path to future success. For example, as a group many Asian and Asian American children attain academic success. What role does culture play in these outcomes? &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=l4wwBgAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PA119&amp;amp;dq=Understanding+Taiwanese+children%E2%80%99s+play+via+constructing+and+reconstructing:+a+prospective+vision&amp;amp;ots=s3ofAeiKoG&amp;amp;sig=ocrn2krrERVpHnGg2WA_A4j09bI#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Understanding%20Taiwanese%20children%E2%80%99s%20play%20via%20constructing%20and%20reconstructing%3A%20a%20prospective%20vision&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;Chang&lt;/a&gt; notes that as a group, Chinese and Taiwanese parents place a high value on education. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207590544000068&quot;&gt;Kim and Park&lt;/a&gt;  note the same is true for Korean parents. Parenting approaches in these communities highlight training and disciplining children, parent self-sacrifice, and devotion to children. Parents believe perseverance and hard work is the key to success and socialization practices reinforce these values and traits. These cultural practices help children internalize the values their parents place upon education and behaving according to social norms. Children acquire these values and are loyal, appreciative, and dedicated to their parents for their support and encouragement. In part, they attain academic success to honor their parents and the broader social groups to which they belong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Teacher perceptions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teachers play an important role in children’s academic success too. What practices work best to motivate children to do well at school? The answer depends upon numerous factors. For example, many teachers will be entrusted with educating children who may not share their cultural heritage. How might this cultural mismatch shape children’s school experiences and potential for academic success?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most American school practices reflect dominant, mainstream American values, norms, and behavioral scripts. For most European American children who value independence and uniqueness, teacher praise and rewards can be highly motivating. However, for children who come from families that value humility and modesty, receiving praise in front of classmates might be an uncomfortable interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Student engagement norms are another example. Many American teachers using a mainstream cultural lens, connect active student engagement with student attentiveness. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/331021&quot;&gt;Yamamoto and Li&lt;/a&gt;noted that for many Asian and Asian American students, knowing when to be quiet is a desirable skill which caregivers socialize their children to acquire. Teachers using mainstream, American cultural values and norms may perceive quiet students as disengaged and inattentive. These perceptions impact children’s motivation to learn and academic success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;School curricula and children’s learning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dominant, mainstream American values tend to permeate curricular and teaching practices. Many American schools promote individual learning and problem-solving approaches rather than group or collaborative problem-solving strategies. The focus upon individualized learning connects to the cultural ideology of individualism and the independent self. These approaches promote the self as separate and unique from social others. Many European American children participate in cultural practices and routines that reinforce this worldview and values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, many Latinx and indigenous children participate in cultural practices and activities at home that value group and collaborative problem solving. These practices connect to the cultural ideology of collectivism and the interdependent self. At home children participate in practices and routines that emphasize the importance of the group, especially family. Thus, there is a disconnect between the approaches at home with the practices and routines the child encounters at school. Consequently, many of these children often have difficulty reaching their maximum potential in classrooms that promote individual problem-solving skills. Why does this happen and does this necessarily have be the outcome?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many children from cultural heritages that promote collectivist values and an interdependent cultural model of the self, the cultural practices in which the child participates at home may conflict with those the child encounters at school. Often, teachers are unaware of these sources of conflict. However, this conflict between home and school does not need to impede students’ success or invalidate the child’s cultural heritage. One solution is for schools to meet students halfway and bridge the gap between the two contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two fine examples are &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.wested.org/resources/bridging-cultures-in-our-schools-new-approaches-that-work-knowledge-brief/&quot;&gt;The Bridging Cultures Project&lt;/a&gt; designed to assist immigrant and indigenous children in the US and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781351237109/chapters/10.4324/9781351237109-2&quot;&gt;Kamehameha Early Education Program (KEEP)&lt;/a&gt; designed to assist native Hawaiian children. Both programs highlight how helping teachers become more aware, respectful, accepting, and inclusive of all their students’ cultural values and goals shapes children’s motivation and academic success at school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous cultural forces connect to children’s school experiences and academic achievement. These include parental beliefs, socialization practices, and cultural worldviews. Cultural values, practices, and ways of learning at home both shape and connect to children’s formal school experiences. Educational initiatives such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.wested.org/project/bridging-cultures-project/&quot;&gt;The Bridging Cultures Project&lt;/a&gt;  and KEEP highlight the importance of cultural compatibility and connectedness in fostering children’s active engagement in school. Acknowledging and incorporating cultural knowledge, patterns, and ways of learning at home when they disconnect with those at school is one important way to ensure all children’s academic success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured image: School children in India, by Richard Veit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/02/what-role-does-culture-play-in-shaping-childrens-school-experiences/&quot;&gt;What role does culture play in shaping children’s school experiences?&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/644350254/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/644350254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/644350254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/644350254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/644350254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/644350254/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/644350254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/644350254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/644350254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/644350254/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/02/dead-zones-growing-areas-of-aquatic-hypoxia-are-threatening-our-oceans-and-rivers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dead zones: growing areas of aquatic hypoxia are threatening our oceans and rivers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/02/how-the-covid-19-pandemic-may-permanently-change-our-childrens-world/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How the COVID-19 pandemic may permanently change our children’s world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/01/safety-first-considering-protest-reasoning-10-years-on-from-the-arab-spring/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Safety first?

 &lt;p&gt;Thank you to our volunteers. Your contributions throughout the past year have helped accelerate discovery and develop science during these unpredictable times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team at PLOS and the wider Open Science community are incredibly grateful for the thoughtfulness and expertise that you, our Editorial Board Members, Guest Editors and Reviewers, bring to your roles in the peer review process. Your rigorous assessment of submitted manuscripts is an invaluable contribution, and your ongoing commitment to Open Science inspires us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank You &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS’ Chief Scientific Officer, Veronique Kiermer’s message of thanks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;oembed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we achieve?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the past year our journal teams have worked to introduce new Open Access opportunities to support inclusivity, reproducibility and improving trust in science by involving more people in the scientific process. Our efforts aim to ensure a diverse and sustainable publishing ecosystem providing researchers of every career stage and discipline the chance to publish their findings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As of 2020 all PLOS journals now offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/how-can-we-partner/&quot;&gt;institutional partnership deals&lt;/a&gt; to equitably distribute the costs of publication and ensure that Open Science is really open for all. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ve empowered researchers to share more of their science with new &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/&quot;&gt;registered report submission&lt;/a&gt; options at &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; which introduces peer review at the experiment design stage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The quality and breadth of PLOS research has enabled us to create new &lt;a href=&quot;https://collections.plos.org/about/&quot;&gt;curated editorial collections&lt;/a&gt; to advance a range of important fields.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-18640&quot; height=&quot;294&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/CTY-infographic-Gif_1_2.gif&quot; width=&quot;588&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;None of this would be possible without you, our dedicated Editorial Board Members, Guest Editors and Reviewers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coming soon…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we step into 2021 we will all undoubtedly come up against a unique set of challenges but rest assured, PLOS will continue to serve the Open Science community. Together we can ensure that researchers from all regions have every opportunity to share their work with experienced scientists from a host of disciplines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;Once again, &lt;strong&gt;THANK YOU&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;ALL &lt;/strong&gt;of our dedicated volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12279&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12279&quot; height=&quot;197&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/trends-300x197.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;from Samaras, et al. (2021)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking disease outbreaks is key to combating them, and predicting epidemics can help direct prevention measures most effectively. Google Trends has been used to track and/or predict the spread of infections diseases including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study extended these analyses to measles, a highly infectious disease causing outbreaks around the world, by comparing official data on measles in Europe to data from Google Trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that the prediction model generated from the Google Trends data overall closely matched the data on actual cases. The prediction was more accurate for countries that had higher measles activity. One advantage of using data from Google trends to track and predict disease outbreaks is that the data are available almost in real time, in contrast to official data that often take months to be released. This could help with faster responses to contain the spread of the illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccardiovascdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12872-020-01815-4?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Cardiovascular Disorders&lt;/em&gt;: Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction promotes myocardial angiogenesis and functional improvements in rat model of diabetic cardiomyopathy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12280 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/AdobeStock_4564432-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), a heart condition common in people with diabetes, is caused in part by a lack of blood vessel growth and repair in heart tissue. Growth factor therapy can promote angiogenesis to treat DCM, but delivery of the therapy has proven difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of this study tested ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) in rats with DCM as a potential safe and effective way to stimulate angiogenesis in the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that UTMD used with Sonovue microbubbles restored heart function in the rats who received the treatment. Histology and microscopy showed that much of the damage to the heart tissue seen in the DCM rats had been reversed by the treatment. This new technique shows promise as a noninvasive therapy for early intervention of DCM in diabetic patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;c-article-title&quot; data-test=&quot;article-title&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-021-03554-6?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt;:  Which growth standards should be used to identify large- and small-for-gestational age infants of mothers with type 1 diabetes? A pre-specified analysis of the CONCEPTT trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12281 size-medium alignright&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/Fotolia_349804_Subscription_XL-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babies born at either end of the birthweight bell curve are at higher risk of neonatal complications such as respiratory distress or NICU admission, but determining the cut-off precentile for considering a newborn at risk depends on a range of factors. Different standards account for these factors differently, leading to discrepancies in identifying babies at risk. Maternal diabetes is one of the factors that affect both a newborn’s birthweight and their risk of complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study has applied three widely-used growth standards to a large, international cohort of babies born to mothers with diabetes. Birthweight percentiles were calculated using each of the standards and then predicted risk of complications based on those percentiles was compared with actual outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors concluded that one of the growth standards, which did not account for gestational age at birth, was not suitable for risk assessment of babies born to mothers with diabetes, while the other two showed high associations between cut-offs for large- and small-for-gestational-age and rates of complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-021-02037-9?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Geriatrics&lt;/em&gt;: Life after falls prevention exercise – experiences of older people taking part in a clinical trial: a phenomenological study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12282 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/AdobeStock_141571612-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Falling is a serious risk for older adults, and falls-prevention exercise interventions have shown good results in preventing falls in the short-term. However, little is known about the long-term effects of these interventions and whether they produce ongoing changes in the exercise behaviors of the participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fill in these gaps, the authors of this study interviewed older adults who had participated in a fall-prevention exercise trial about their experiences in the trial and their exercise activities and falls after the conclusion of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants described maintaining physical activity since the conclusion of the trial, but very few continued with the exercises they had learned in the intervention. Many of the participants minimized the seriousness of falls they had experienced. These interviews highlighted that the challenges in encouraging older adults to continue with falls-prevention exercises after the conclusion of an intervention are similar to the challenges in convincing them to participate in the interventions in the first place. Those working with older adults need to understand individual needs and habits and to contextualize the importance of fall prevention within each individual’s own priorities for maintaining health and independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-06049-w?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Health Services Research&lt;/em&gt;: Meta-ethnography in healthcare research: a guide to using a meta-ethnographic approach for literature synthesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These clear guidelines will allow authors … to produce rigorous and comprehensive syntheses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta-ethnography, the synthesis of multiple qualitative studies, can provide insights into the experiences of patients and health-care professionals and generate evidence that can be used to inform healthcare practice and policy. However, there are not yet clear guidelines on the process of meta-ethnography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, the authors of a new paper have designed a step-by-step method for conducting a meta-ethnography, including examples. They especially focused on the middle and later stages of the process, “determining how the studies are related, translating the studies into one another, synthesising the translations,” due to the difficulty of these steps and the dearth of existing guidance for conducting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These clear guidelines will allow authors of future meta-ethnographies, even those new to the methodology, to produce rigorous and comprehensive syntheses of evidence that contribute to improvements in patient care and healthcare processes.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Subscribers to arXiv’s daily email announcement recently experienced a disruption in service. Maintenance performed by arXiv’s email provider was found to be the cause of the disruption. The issue has been resolved, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time, functionality on arXiv.org remained intact. Readers and authors could continue to browse and download new papers on arXiv.org, as well as submit their own articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The issue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily emails announcing new papers were received late, or not at all. Other emails, such as account registration confirmations, were also affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The response&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first identified and fixed a problem related to the email disruption, and began sending the email backlog to subscribers. Soon after that process began, another issue was identified that inadvertently truncated subscriber lists, specific to several subject areas. Finally, the distribution lists for all subject areas were restored and remaining announcements were sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, if any subscribers find that the daily announcement email is not received, we advise them &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe&quot;&gt;to resubscribe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remediation &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that researchers rely on the daily announcement for their work, and we aim to avoid such disruptions in the future by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automating daily backups of the distribution lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applying fixes to prevent the root cause&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving the monitoring of the daily email announcement systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviewing our overall backup and recovery plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appreciate our subscribers’ patience as we resolved the issue and, again, we apologize for any inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A message to the community from the Directors of the Institutes, Centers, and Offices involved in the NIH BRAIN Initiative and NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-3042&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NINDS Director Walter J. Koroshetz, NIMH Director Joshua A. Gordon, NIA Director Richard Hodes, NIDA Director Nora D. Volkow, NCATS Director Christopher P. Austin, NICHD Director Diana W. Bianchi, NEI Director Michael F. Chiang, NIDCR Director Rena D’Souza, NIAAA Director George F. Koob, NCCIH Director Helene Langevin, NIH BRAIN Initiative Director John J. Ngai, OBSSR Director William T. Riley, NIBIB Director Bruce J. Tromberg, NIDCD Director Debara L. Tucci, NIEHS Director Rick Woychik, NINR Director Shannon N. Zenk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inherent in the mission of NIH is that biomedical research and its application can and should benefit all people. Significant events across our nation over the past year and frank discussions in the research community have led to deep reflection at NIH about biases and disparities faced by underrepresented groups in the research enterprise. As we strive to recognize our own role in these challenges, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html&quot;&gt;affirm our commitment to diversity&lt;/a&gt; and to positive change to eliminate racism in our community and in our organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a step towards that change, the NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices that are part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;the NIH BRAIN Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, strongly encourage the neuroscience community to take advantage of the new NIH-wide &lt;a href=&quot;https://commonfund.nih.gov/first&quot;&gt;Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (FIRST) Program&lt;/a&gt;, supported by the NIH Common Fund. Although progress has been made to increase participation of historically underrepresented groups in biomedical training stages, members of these groups are still less likely to be hired into positions as independently funded faculty researchers. These populations include underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help address this disparity, the FIRST program aims to enhance cultures of inclusive excellence through institutional support for recruitment of diverse “cohorts” of early-stage research faculty. Here, “inclusive excellence” describes the cultivation of scientific environments that can engage and benefit from a full range of talent. Neuroscience continues to be one of the fastest growing areas of biomedical research. We want the FIRST program to enable researchers to thrive, and we believe the broader neuroscience community has much to gain. Indeed, the growing field of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://diversity.nih.gov/find-read-learn/diversity-research-articles&quot;&gt;Science of Diversity&lt;/a&gt; shows the positive impacts that result when heterogeneous teams apply diverse perspectives and expertise to research challenges. We are hopeful that the cohort hiring model in FIRST will succeed in turning the culture in neuroscience departments and their institutions toward greater inclusion and diversity. We fully recognize that there are structural barriers perpetuated by gaps and that critical improvements must be made, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuronline.sfn.org/diversity/fostering-diversity-and-inclusion-in-neuroscience-faculty&quot;&gt;many groups are severely underrepresented in neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;. To our neuroscientists: we encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity as a path to meaningful change. We are committed to fostering a more inclusive, equitable, and diverse neuroscience community, and the FIRST program is a step in the right direction, with many, many more steps to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objectives of the FIRST program are twofold: to &lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-20-022.html&quot;&gt;support institutions in hiring diverse cohort&lt;/a&gt;s of early stage research faculty; and to transform culture at NIH-funded extramural institutions by building a community of scientists who are committed to diversity and inclusive excellence. In addition to funds for hiring, the program will support new and strengthened institution-wide approaches to facilitating the success of cohort members and future faculty from diverse backgrounds. For cohort members, this is likely to include mentoring, sponsorship, and networking opportunities. For institutions, this may include training faculty in approaches known to foster inclusive excellence and changing the rubric for interviewing processes. The FIRST program will also &lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-20-023.html&quot;&gt;fund a coordination and evaluation center&lt;/a&gt;, which will develop and guide the collection of common data metrics to rigorously assess the effects of FIRST faculty cohorts and institutional activities on the research culture at funded institutions. Lessons learned by these institutions will be shared with the broader biomedical research community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FIRST program is expected to fund 12 awards over the next three years, plus the coordination and evaluation center, with an estimated budget of $241M over nine years, contingent upon the availability of funds. The first receipt date for the program’s funding opportunities is &lt;strong&gt;March 1, 2021. &lt;/strong&gt;For more information, please also view the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://nci.rev.vbrick.com/#/events/a3aee724-a9e7-45fd-ba2d-bef6ca56de9f&quot;&gt;technical assistance webinar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-pfizer-vaccine-may-reduce-transmission"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Researchers are getting the first real-world hints that a vaccine can curb the coronavirus’s spread, not just prevent people from getting seriously ill. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People vaccinated with Pfizer’s shots and who still get infected with the coronavirus carry less virus in their bodies than unvaccinated people who are infected, researchers from Israel report in two separate preliminary studies posted February 8 at medRxiv.org.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the vaccines do reduce the spread of the virus, “it means that even people [who] aren’t vaccinated will gain protection from the vaccinated people around them,” says Marm Kilpatrick, an infectious diseases researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz. As more people get vaccinated, they won’t go on to infect as many other people as they might have before the shot, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even as data on vaccines’ ability to curb transmission is just starting to emerge, U.S. public health officials have updated quarantine guidelines for vaccinated people exposed to the virus. If exposure happens from two weeks to three months after getting both doses of Pfizer’s or Moderna’s vaccine, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html&quot;&gt;no quarantine is needed&lt;/a&gt;, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said February 10. That’s because the vaccines are highly effective at preventing COVID-19 symptoms, and people who get sick are thought to be more likely to transmit the virus.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new finding that vaccines may curb coronavirus spread comes from vaccination and infection data from Israel. After a clinical trial showed that Pfizer’s vaccine had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-vaccine-pfizer-biontech-final-results&quot;&gt;95 percent efficacy to prevent COVID-19 symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, Israeli health officials swiftly vaccinated a large swath of the country’s population — particularly people 60 years and older (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/18/20&lt;/em&gt;). As of February 6, 80 percent of people in that age group had &lt;a href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination-israel-impact&quot;&gt;received both doses of the vaccine&lt;/a&gt; compared with 20 percent of younger people, according to data from Our World in Data. Almost half of the population has received at least one dose, and infection rates and hospitalizations in Israel are falling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Curious to see if the vaccination effort was curbing viral transmission, researchers compared the levels of virus in more than 15,000 coronavirus test samples. The team did not know the vaccination status of those tested. But “this was a unique point in time where we had two different groups” in the population, with older people probably having been vaccinated and younger people most likely not, says Ella Petter, a computational biologist with MyHeritage Lab, a genealogy company headquartered in Or Yehuda, Israel, that conducts COVID-19 tests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Samples that tested positive for the coronavirus from people over age 60 had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.08.21251329v1.full.pdf&quot;&gt;lower levels of the coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; on average than samples from people 40 to 60 years old, who were less likely to have been vaccinated, Petter and her colleagues found. Computational analyses showed that the vaccine rollout best explained the differences between the two groups, rather than factors like demographics or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-variants-reinfection-vaccination-efforts&quot;&gt;new coronavirus variants&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/5/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a separate study, researchers found that people who got infected within the 12 days following their first Pfizer shot — and had little to no protection against COVID-19 — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.06.21251283v1.full.pdf&quot;&gt;harbor four times more coronavirus in their bodies&lt;/a&gt; compared with people who got infected more than 12 days after their first shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Past studies have shown that when there is less virus in the body, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30985-3/fulltext&quot;&gt;a person is less likely to pass on coronavirus to others&lt;/a&gt; compared with people with a higher viral load. Taken with the new findings that show that vaccinated people who still get infected have less virus than unvaccinated people, the data hint that Pfizer’s vaccine might reduce the spread of coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though vaccinated people appear to be less likely to transmit the virus, it remains unclear just how much transmission could still happen. That’s because people’s viral load can vary widely in general; the reported decrease in viral loads in vaccinated people is small compared with the range of viral levels experts have seen in COVID-19 patients, Kilpatrick says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to note that the studies show “a snapshot of viral loads,” representing how much virus a person carried at a single point in time, he says. Analyzing viral load over an entire infection — from first positive test to recovery — would show how infectiousness might fluctuate during that time. That could help researchers better grasp the effects of vaccination, such as how long a person who caught the virus before they were fully protected with a vaccine might be contagious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it’s unclear whether the second dose, which gives the immune response an extra boost, might further reduce viral loads in vaccinated people, Kilpatrick says. It’s also unknown how long protection might last.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, those lower viral loads observed in the coronavirus test samples suggest that even if vaccinated people get infected, they may release less virus into the environment in respiratory droplets and aerosols. And that hints that vaccinated people may be less contagious, although the studies looked only at people who got Pfizer’s vaccine. If true, that could help speed the end of the pandemic and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccines-questions-daily-life-transmission-variants&quot;&gt;return to some sort of normalcy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/29/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Flight isn’t easy at the edge of space. But tiny “microfliers” could soar high in Earth’s atmosphere fueled only by sunlight, experiments suggest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At heights between about 50 and 80 kilometers above Earth’s surface, in what’s known as the mesosphere, the atmosphere is so thin that airplanes and balloons can’t stay aloft. But mechanical engineer Mohsen Azadi and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania saw promise in a technique that uses light to levitate objects. The researchers cut disks of transparent Mylar 6 millimeters in diameter and coated the bottom sides with carbon nanotubes. When heated by light, the tiny aircraft &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe1127&quot;&gt;floated inside a vacuum chamber&lt;/a&gt; with a pressure that mimicked the mesosphere, the researchers report February 12 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carbon nanotubes are key for the microfliers to achieve liftoff. The nanotubes absorb light, warming the flier. Air molecules gain energy when they collide with the warmed flier, ricocheting away from it at higher speeds. The molecules gain extra oomph from striking the carbon nanotubes on the bottom of the craft. That’s thanks to the material’s nooks and crannies: Air molecules collide multiple times with the nanotubes, getting even warmer and gaining more energy than those that strike the top. That extra energy translates to speedier molecules. As a result, air molecules ricochet away from the bottom of the microflier faster than from the top, generating lift.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microfliers could run on sunlight or laser light and could someday carry small instruments to measure conditions in the relatively unexplored mesosphere, the researchers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Light helps tiny aircraft made of carbon nanotube–coated Mylar achieve liftoff. Such “microfliers” could someday be used to explore high in Earth’s atmosphere. &lt;/figure&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;By now, most people have gotten the message that wearing a face mask is one way to help stop the spread of COVID-19. But now health officials are taking the masking message a step further: Don’t just wear a mask, wear it well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taking steps to improve the way medical masks fit can protect wearers from about 96 percent of the aerosol particles thought to spread the coronavirus, a study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found. That’s provided both people are wearing masks. But even if only one person is wearing a mask tweaked to fit snugly, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7007e1.htm?s_cid=mm7007e1_w&quot;&gt;wearer is protected from 64.5 percent to 83 percent&lt;/a&gt; of potentially virus-carrying particles, the researchers report February 10 in &lt;em&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I know some of you are both tired of hearing about masks, as well as tired of wearing them,” CDC director Rochelle Walensky said February 10 during a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/02/10/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-3/&quot;&gt;White House briefing&lt;/a&gt;. But scientists have learned in the past year how effective masks can be to protect people from catching COVID-19, she said. “The bottom line is this: Masks work, and they work best when they have a good fit and are worn correctly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;





&lt;p&gt;That message is increasingly crucial as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-variants-reinfection-vaccination-efforts&quot;&gt;more transmissible coronavirus variants&lt;/a&gt; — including ones first detected in South Africa and the United Kingdom — are beginning to spread more widely in the United States (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/5/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plenty of studies have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-why-wearing-masks-controversial&quot;&gt;already demonstrated that masks cut down on the amount of spit particles&lt;/a&gt; that may spray others when a person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/26/20&lt;/em&gt;). Still, photos and videos show that air and droplets often escape from the tops, sides and bottoms of ill-fitting masks. “Even a small gap can degrade the performance of your mask by 50 percent,” says Linsey Marr, an environmental engineer at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Good masks have both good filtration and good fit, she says. “Good filtration removes as many particles as possible, and a good fit means that there are no leaks around the sides of your mask, where air — and viruses — can leak through.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several recent studies, have demonstrated that some pretty simple measures to improve fit also cut down aerosol emissions. Those measures include using &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2774266?alert=article&amp;amp;alert=article&quot;&gt;ear savers, pantyhose&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.20249101v1&quot;&gt;mask fitters&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/med/fulltext/S2666-6340(20)30072-6&quot;&gt;putting a cloth mask over a medical mask&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those studies showed that wearing a mask protects other people from what the wearer spews out. But John Brooks, an infectious diseases physician and the chief medical officer for the CDC’s COVID-19 emergency response, and colleagues wanted to know whether those tricks to make masks fit better had any effect on protecting the mask wearer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So the researchers set up two manikins facing each other six feet apart. One manikin served as the source, “exhaling” via a tube aerosol particles of saltwater of a size that could carry the coronavirus. (No viruses were used in the experiment.) The other manikin was the receiver.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers measured how many saline droplets reached a mouthpiece in the receiving manikin that represented its nose and throat. In some experiments, the team put medical masks on just one of the manikins. In others, both wore masks. The team tried two scenarios to make the mask fit better: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UANi8Cc71A0&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;knotting the ear loops close to the mask and tucking in the ends&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate side gaps; and wearing a cloth mask over the medical mask.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;CDC test of double masking and knotting and tucking mask ends&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096426&quot; height=&quot;285&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021121_ts_mask_inline_desktop_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096426&quot;&gt;Researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested two tricks to improve the fit of medical procedure masks: putting a cloth mask on top of the medical mask (left), or knotting the ear loops and tucking in the ends of the mask (right). Both reduced the amount of particles reaching a manikin’s artificial throat compared with an ill-fitting mask or no mask at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096426&quot;&gt;CDC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;image-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;CDC mannequin wearing two masks and knotting and tucking mask ends&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096427&quot; height=&quot;293&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021121_ts_mask_inline_mobile_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096427&quot;&gt;Researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested two tricks to improve the fit of medical procedure masks: putting a cloth mask on top of the medical mask (left), or knotting the ear loops and tucking in the ends of the mask (right). Both reduced the amount of particles reaching a manikin’s artificial throat compared with an ill-fitting mask or no mask at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096427&quot;&gt;CDC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In each set-up, the result was compared with wearing no mask at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the receiver wore an ill-fitting mask, the amount of droplets reaching its throat was reduced by 7.5 percent. When the source was the one wearing the mask, the receiver’s exposure was reduced by 41.3 percent. And when both dummies wore masks, particle exposure was 84.3 percent lower than with no mask.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty good. But not as good as it could be. When the receiver wore a knotted and tucked mask, its exposure was reduced by 64.5 percent. And when both manikins wore the knotted and tucked masks, protection was even stronger: Exposure dropped by a whopping 95.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wearing a cloth mask over the medical mask improved fit even more. When just the receiving manikin wore the double mask, it was protected from 83 percent of particles. And when both manikins doubled up on masks, 96.4 percent of particles were blocked from reaching the receiver’s mouthpiece.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those data show that “it’s mask fit that really matters, and there are bunch of different ways to improve mask fit,” says David Rothamer, a mechanical engineer at the University of Wisconsin–Madison College of Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rothamer and colleagues tested devices called mask fitters or mask braces — rubber or plastic frames that fit over the mask molding it more closely to the face. A medical mask alone filters about 20 percent of aerosol droplets leaving the mouth, protecting others slightly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.20249101v1&quot;&gt;With a mask fitter in place, 90 to 95 percent&lt;/a&gt; of droplets were filtered, Rothamer and colleagues reported January 4 at medRxiv.org. That report hasn’t been reviewed by other scientists yet. The CDC team didn’t test mask fitters, but that level of filtration should help protect the wearer, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Piling on masks beyond two masks probably won’t improve filtration, and it may muffle voices and make it difficult to breathe, says Monica Gandhi, an infectious diseases doctor at the University of California, San Francisco. “No more than two. Just stop there, please.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Manikin with loose mask and tighter-fitting mask&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3096428&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021221_ti_mask_inline_2_rev.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3096428&quot;&gt;Aerosol particles can spew from gaps where medical masks don’t fit the face (left as demonstrated on a manikin). But a mask fitter worn over the medical mask, like this one developed by researchers at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, can prevent that leakage (right).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3096428&quot;&gt;Scott Sanders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She and Marr &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/med/fulltext/S2666-6340(20)30072-6&quot;&gt;proposed the double masking&lt;/a&gt; strategy to improve the fit of the medical mask in the Jan. 15 &lt;em&gt;Med&lt;/em&gt;. Medical mask material is electrostatically charged, which may repel microbes, in addition to filtering particles. The cloth mask helps reduce gaps around the sides and top of the medical mask. Although the CDC study tested the cloth mask over the medical mask, Gandhi says the order may not matter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doubling up on cloth masks hasn’t been tested, but Gandhi says it’s probably not helpful.  “I see no point. It may improve fit, but it doesn’t improve filtration.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are many simple ways to improve the fit of masks, says Emily Sickbert-Bennett, an epidemiologist and head of infection prevention at the University of North Carolina Medical Center in Chapel Hill. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2774266?alert=article&amp;amp;alert=article&quot;&gt;pantyhose sleeve&lt;/a&gt; over a medical mask improved filtration to about 80 percent, she and her colleagues reported December 10 in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVjGCPfRwUo&quot;&gt;mask fitter made of rubber bands&lt;/a&gt; as well as devices known as ear guards or ear savers also performed well. In unpublished work, the researchers have also confirmed that putting a cloth mask over the medical mask works well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond the question of fit, the CDC report also illustrates how important it is for everyone to wear masks, Sickbert-Bennett says. “The best form of double masking is when you and the person you’re interacting with are both wearing a mask.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image is-style-default&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;cover of the February 13, 1971 issue&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-84045&quot; height=&quot;206&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/1971/02/1971-02-13.jpg&quot; width=&quot;155&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More about partons&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/physical-sciences-27&quot;&gt;Science News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, February 13, 1971&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experiments in which protons and neutrons were bombarded with high-energy electrons have given indications that protons and neutrons are not amorphous masses but composed of distinct subparticles. The subparticles have been named partons, and whether or not they correspond to the hypothetical quarks remains a moot question.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Update&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The so-called partons seen in experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center were indeed quarks — a discovery that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/quark-finders-win-nobel&quot;&gt;won three researchers the 1990 Nobel Prize in physics&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/27/90, p. 263&lt;/em&gt;). Predicted by physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964, quarks are the building blocks of most of the universe’s ordinary matter. Quarks were originally thought to come in three varieties: up, down and strange. But particle collider experiments have revealed three additional types: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/last-evidence-top-quark&quot;&gt;charm, bottom and top&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/30/94, p. 276&lt;/em&gt;). Quarks usually come in pairs or trios. Recently, physicists have glimpsed more elaborate&lt;a data-id=&quot;3089438&quot; data-type=&quot;post&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-particle-cern-tetraquark-first-four-same-kind-quark&quot;&gt; tetraquarks&lt;/a&gt; and pentaquarks (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/1/20, p. 14&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plenty of work suggests that we have a “reminiscence bump” for music, tending to preferentially recall songs from our teenage years and young adulthood.&lt;/strong&gt; Now a new study has found that while music from these years is indeed more familiar, it’s not always the case that we &lt;em&gt;like &lt;/em&gt;it more. Younger participants in particular didn’t show a strong preference for music from their youth. “This suggests that songs from our adolescence can become closely entangled with memories from our past even if we don’t personally value the music,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/why-were-obsessed-with-music-from-our-youth-154864&quot;&gt;writes researcher Kelly Jakubowski&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have created “mini-brains” containing a genetic variant from our Neanderthal and Denisovan cousins.&lt;/strong&gt; The brain organoids are different from regular human ones: they are smaller, have a rougher texture, and show differences at the neuronal level, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00388-2&quot;&gt;reports Ariana Remmel&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. But some researchers are sceptical about how much these organoids can really tell us about the brains of our extinct relatives.&lt;/p&gt;

The animals learned to control a joystick with their snouts to move a cursor to a target, receiving a reward of food pellets when successful. We already know pigs are intelligent animals, but the work shows that they can even understand the association between moving a joystick and the movement of a cursor on screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Hanks’ announcement that he had COVID-19 in March 2020 may have made people take coronavirus more seriously.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s according to a study conducted immediately after the news broke last year. Participants said that seeing a high profile and well-liked public figure contract the disease made COVID-19 seem more like a threat, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/tom-hanks-coronavirus-study_n_601ecde0c5b6f38d06e415f3?ri18n=true&quot;&gt;reports Jeremy Blum&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;HuffPost&lt;/em&gt;.

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/number-milky-way-nova-explosions-per-year-pinned-down"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Each year, astronomers discover nova explosions in the Milky Way that cause dim stars to flare up and emit far more light than the sun before they fade again. But our galaxy is so big and dusty that no one knows how many of these eruptions occur throughout its vast domain, where they fling newly minted chemical elements into space.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, by detecting the explosions’ infrared light, which penetrates dust better than visible light does, Caltech astronomer Kishalay De and his colleagues have &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04045&quot;&gt;estimated how often these outbursts occur in the Milky Way&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing the nova rate is vital for determining how much these explosions have contributed to the galaxy’s chemical makeup by creating new elements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The updated tally puts the rate at 46, give or take 13, a year, the team reports January 11 at arXiv.org. Past estimates of the nova rate have ranged from just 10 a year to 300.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A nova arises from a binary star — two stars circling each other. One is a white dwarf, a dense star that’s about as small as Earth but approximately as massive as the sun. After the white dwarf receives gas from its companion, the gas explodes, making the dim star shine brilliantly. The nova does not destroy the star, unlike a supernova, which marks a star’s death.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;After observing the sky from Palomar Observatory in California for 17 months, De and colleagues detected 12 nova explosions. Estimating the number of missed outbursts, the astronomers deduced the yearly nova rate. Their rate is similar to, but more precise than, one reported four years ago by Allen Shafter, an astronomer at San Diego State University who pegged the annual nova rate at between 27 and 81.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’re doing a wonderful job,” says Bradley Schaefer, an astrophysicist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, who notes that searching at infrared wavelengths is ideal for finding distant explosions obscured by the galaxy’s dust. “They have an awful lot of really good data.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The more precise rate helps firm up estimates for how much these explosions have altered the galaxy’s chemical composition. In this regard, it’s hard for a mere nova to compete with a supernova explosion, which, though rare, releases far more newly produced elements than a nova does. But if the annual nova rate is around 50, then certain scarce isotopes on Earth — such as lithium-7, carbon-13, nitrogen-15 and oxygen-17 — arose partially or mostly in nova explosions, says Sumner Starrfield, an astronomer at Arizona State University in Tempe who was not involved with this study. The blasts then spirited these isotopes away before additional nuclear reactions could destroy them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;En hel dag, med några korta pauser, tog det att presentera grundpelare och huvudteman för det nya ramprogrammet för EU-forskning, Horisont Europa (#HorizonEurope). Presentationen arrangerades gemensamt av 6 stora svenska finansiärer; Energimyndigheten, FORMAS, Forte, Rymdstryrelsen, Vetenskapsrådet, och Vinnova. Många bra presentationer och panelsamtal! Jag har summerat det hela &lt;a data-id=&quot;https://wakelet.com/wake/J0Bmo2UaMo3i03wWd8WUp&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; href=&quot;https://wakelet.com/wake/J0Bmo2UaMo3i03wWd8WUp&quot;&gt;i tweets här&lt;/a&gt;, men det finns en del att lyfta upp som inte ryms i kortfattade meningar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Öppen vetenskap nämndes EN gång (av John Tumpane, från FORMAS). Data-delning nämndes inte alls. Samverkan däremot nämndes upprepade gånger, framför allt med fokus på industrin. Standarder nämndes i förbifarten, framför allt som något viktigt för industrin att bevaka och delta i utvecklandet av.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mycket av fokus låg på “partnerships”, arrangerade och finansierade strategiska multi-partssamarbeten som är menade att ge garanterad förutsägbar nytta. Hela 50% av budgeten går dit. Partnerships är inte nya för EU, men det utökade fokuset på nytta är en lite ändrad inriktning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;En nyhet för det här ramprogrammet är “&lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/info/horizon-europe/missions-horizon-europe_en&quot;&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt;“, övergripande målbilder som ska vara förankrade i samhällsbehov och ge samhällsnytta, och göra det lättare att nå målen för the European Green Deal och Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan såväl som hållbarhetsmålen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forskningsinfrastrukturer nämndes en hel del i början av samtalet (det är en av pelarna), och får en hyfsad andel av budgeten, men var inte särskilt närvarande när det kom till samverkans-diskussionen (där jag tycker de absolut passar in).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regioner nämndes som möjliga innovationshubbar och koordinatorer, vilket var en trevlig ny vinkel – tidigare har jag mest hört regioner nämnas som trösklar och fragmentering, och ett problem för det svenska Life Science-ekosystemet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Universitet nämndes i början – när vikten av rätt utbildning och mobilitet i utbildning diskuterades – men inte explicit i senare diskussioner om samverkan; där låg fokus mest på individuella forskare och på industrin. Universitet borde rimligen också vara nyckelmedlemmar i samverkansprojekt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Två viktiga gap (”valleys of death”) i kunskapsöverföring och nyttogörande  nämndes: den slingrande vägen  som krävs för att ta forskning från labbet till industrin, och svårigheten att skala upp innovativa start-ups på ett hållbart sätt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regeringen håller på och arbetar ut en nationell strategi för Sveriges deltagande i Horisont Europa, det är dock ännu oklart exakt när den kommer vara klar. Det ska bli intressant att se vad den innehåller; EU-ansökningar anses allmänt vara tunga, arbetskrävande och komplicerade. Stödbidrag för att frigöra tid att sätta ihop en ansökan vore kanske användbart. Utökat stöd från universitetens administratörer och Grant Offices också. (När jag jobbade med mitt första EU-projekt hade vi en EU-kunnig administratör till hjälp, och vilken &lt;em&gt;skillnad&lt;/em&gt; det gjorde). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tydligen hade Norge sin motsvarande presentation &lt;a data-id=&quot;https://vimeo.com/472252181/f6efee79c0&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/472252181/f6efee79c0&quot;&gt;redan i höstas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<updated>2021-02-11T15:56:07+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Reinoud Maex will talk about a paper &quot;Packaging Life: The Origin of Ion-Selective Channels&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most articles dealing with early life focus on its chemical basis and the
evolution of proteins, RNA, DNA, and other metabolic products. This essay,
however, is concerned primarily with the energy required to produce and
maintain the essential life chemicals, and the necessity to confine them in a
cell where they can function cooperatively. It seems likely that life evolved
in proximity to the undersea vents discovered by the submersible craft Alvin
of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (Woods Hole, MA). Bacteria were
probably the original life form, growing in mats near the vents. Some
advantages of the vents as starting points for life are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;arabic simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plentiful water and essential ions. We are ~60% salt water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Plenty of chemical elements, many out of equilibrium and ready to
combine. From one point of view, chemistry is simply the search of
electrons, e.g., the two around a hydrogen molecule, for vacancies
as close as possible to a nucleus with many protons, e.g., oxygen,
or less avid electron gatherers, e.g., nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, or
phosphorus. Eighteen of the 20 AAs contain only hydrogen, carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen; and the remaining two require sulfur in
addition. DNA and RNA require, in addition, phosphorus. In short, it
is not necessary to dip far into the periodic table to make most of
the life chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Energy can be derived from combining chemicals issuing from the vent, as
in a fuel cell, which derives energy by passing electrons from
hydrogen to oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. The water near a vent is warm, speeding experiments in the evolution of
life chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these essentials, it is easy to imagine that life developed over a period
of time, say a billion years. J. D. Sutherland, who first succeeded in
synthesizing RNA, was quoted as saying: ‘‘My assumption is that we are here on
this planet as a fundamental consequence of organic chemistry.So it must be
chemistry that wants to work’’ (1). This essay starts at the point where early
chemistry has done its work. It deals with the packaging of the life chemicals,
the problems that arise from packaging, and energy production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line-block&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;h6&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Lauren Cadwallader&lt;/em&gt;, PLOS’ Open Research Manager&lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lack of reproducibility of research findings is a continuing concern in modern science.  Code reproducibility is a central part of the problem and we have been exploring code notebooks as one potential solution. We need to understand if these are of value to our community, both readers and authors of computational research, and are asking the computational research community to &lt;a href=&quot;https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6147858/Interactive-Code-Notebooks-Survey&quot;&gt;share their views&lt;/a&gt; on the most important aspects of sharing code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Collaborating on code &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have been exploring opportunities for collaboration with community-focused tools, such as code notebooks, that can improve open, reproducible research practices. PLOS Computational Biology is investigating how we can improve the reproducibility of computational articles in collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neurolibre.com/&quot;&gt;NeuroLibre&lt;/a&gt;, a Canadian-based open science group supported by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://conp.ca/&quot;&gt;Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform&lt;/a&gt;. Code notebooks are documents that contain code, the dependencies needed to run the code and reader friendly text elements, such as paragraphs of text explaining the purpose of the code block and figure captions. These notebooks can be made interactive through the ability to change parameters in figures or edit the code itself.  Notebooks improve open science practices by removing barriers faced by researchers who try to access others’ code, such as setting up the correct environment to run the code, making it simpler to interrogate code underlying the figures in a paper by presenting the code, the resulting analyses and accompanying text in a browser-based notebook. The Computational Biology community is a  logical place to explore how valuable these are since the community already shows high engagement with making code accessible, although primarily via repositories&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NeuroLibre has created prototype versions of code notebooks for two published PLOS Computational Biology articles. They took the code and data that were shared with the articles and turned them into browser-based notebooks that display the figures, with the ability to switch to view the code or to view a Jupyter notebook (hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybinder.org/&quot;&gt;Binder&lt;/a&gt;). While a base level of interactivity can be created without input from the papers’ authors, the NeuroLibre team worked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://notebook-factory.github.io/BayesianRepetoireOverlap/01Introduction/intro.html&quot;&gt;one of the papers&lt;/a&gt;’ authors to create additional interactive figures. These extra features  allow readers to manipulate the underlying data in a different way thanks to author input, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://notebook-factory.github.io/BayesianRepetoireOverlap/03Code/Fig3_final.html&quot;&gt;choosing intermediate sample sizes&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to the three sample sizes detailed in the published paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;351&quot; src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/T4Do4lvQDevPbvaG4UopRqwqvmDvHN-WRwMSmv9sg6LPkdMsP_YXlPMwTSJvosvBiDDbXgzqkAxS0qtJQAt2nccCVENPh00dD3XeKDvT6blBtadYqbZkMse6_m1UFtNcLGGnhq-c&quot; width=&quot;624&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The sample size in the interactive plot can be changed using the dropdown box to the top left of the plot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;What are we up to?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our collaboration with NeuroLibre to date has focused on gathering qualitative user feedback on the prototypes, to understand  the value of these notebooks to computational biology researchers. A series of seven initial interviews helped us to better understand how researchers currently manage and share their code, how and why they access other peoples’ code, and if we are asking the right questions about notebooks. Amongst other things, we are interested in hearing what aspects of publishing reproducible research researchers value the most, what challenges they encounter, and what considerations there are for creating an interactive notebook alongside a published paper. Informed by the outcomes of this initial research, we are now looking for more researchers to share their views on these prototypes via an online questionnaire. This will serve as useful feedback for NeuroLibre to continue improving their tools, and support PLOS in working towards improving reproducibility in research publishing, in collaboration with the scientific community. &lt;br /&gt;If you work in computational biology related research, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6147858/Interactive-Code-Notebooks-Survey&quot;&gt;share your views&lt;/a&gt;! Anonymous results of the survey will be made available in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This next workshop series of 2021 will bring together non-invasive neuroimaging tool developers, neuroscientists, engineers, and industry partners to discuss emerging tools and pathways for disseminating current imaging technologies. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please join us on Feb. 18 and 19, and March 9-11!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-3028&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent advancements in electromagnetic recording, molecular imaging, and other non-invasive brain imaging modalities have allowed researchers to examine the human brain with incredible sensitivity and specificity. Now, it is critical to evaluate how these tools will benefit the future of human neuroscience research. Starting next week, the NIH BRAIN Initiative is hosting a two-part virtual workshop series on non-invasive neuroimaging technologies. As mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/strategic-planning/acd-working-groups/brain-initiative%C2%AE-20-cells-circuits-toward-cures&quot;&gt;BRAIN 2.0 reports&lt;/a&gt;, these workshops will convene experts in neuroimaging from academia and industry to discuss the broader dissemination and transformative potential of new imaging tools in neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshops are open to anyone and will be livestreamed on NIH Videocast. You can view them live &lt;a href=&quot;https://videocast.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on the day of each event.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/11/psychological-impact-of-a-relationship-ending-is-reflected-in-language-of-reddit-users-going-through-break-ups/"/>

		<updated>2021-02-11T13:48:46+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While some relationships are ended in the heat of the moment, for many the decision to break up with a partner involves several long, agonising weeks of weighing up various options. During that time, your attitudes and behaviours towards your partner may change — you might become colder or more distant, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what about your language? According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/7/e2017154118&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, the language we use on social media just prior to a break-up can offer a key insight into the emotional and cognitive impacts of a relationship ending. Looking at over a million posts from 6,803 Reddit users who had posted on r/BreakUps, the University of Texas at Austin team found changes in language that were so consistent they could even be found in posts completely unrelated to relationships at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41361&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the forum, some users open up about why they’re thinking of ending their relationship, or ask advice from fellow posters about particular situations. Other users have been broken up &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt;, using the space to vent and express their sorrow or rage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team looked at the language of forum users for evidence for two types of thinking: cognitive processing and analytic thinking. Cognitive processing is the kind of thinking people do while trying to understand particular problems that they know very little about. Language related to cognitive processing can be grouped by insight words like “understand”, causal words like “because” or “result”, and words related to self-discrepancy like “should”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Analytic thinking, on the other hand, involves logical (sometimes even dispassionate) reasoning about a certain situation, reflected in factual rather than emotional language. The researchers also considered the focus of people’s posts: whether they were oriented around the self, with frequent use of “I”, or around a collective “we”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team used a text analysis system that calculated the percentage of words corresponding to these different dimensions of language, both before and after they had posted about their break-up, and both within r/BreakUps and elsewhere on Reddit. First, a pre-break-up baseline period was established, from a year to four months before the break-up; during this period, there were no significant changes in language. Language was then analysed in two week intervals until a year after the break-up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found significant decreases in analytic thinking a month before the break-up, not returning to baseline levels until six months after the break-up. This suggests a serious disruption in people’s “normal” thinking patterns, starting up to three months before a break-up. The sharpest drop in analytic thinking came at the disclosure of the break-up, with people’s language becoming the most personal and informal in the immediate aftermath of their relationship ending. This remained true even when they were not talking about their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while analytic thinking &lt;em&gt;decreased&lt;/em&gt;, language related to cognitive processing &lt;em&gt;increased&lt;/em&gt;. Use of “I” and “we” words also increased, peaking at the time of the break-up. The effect was largest, unsurprisingly, for “I” words — and again, held even when users were posting about topics completely unrelated to their break-up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though “we” words returned to their baseline levels within a month, analytic thinking and “I” words remained heightened for up to 14 weeks post-break-up. The team suggests that this shows people “continue to be self immersed” even if they have worked through their break-up and divorced themselves from their identity as part of a couple. When, through cognitive processing, people’s stories become more “developed and organised”, as the authors put it, analytic language starts to increase once again; overall, language patterns remained significantly different from baseline until around six months after the break-up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So could writing about your break-up online help you deal with it better? Well, it’s complicated. While expressively writing about your emotions has been associated with higher levels of wellbeing, those who were long-term posters on r/BreakUps were less likely to return to baseline levels of language than those who had only posted once or twice. However, it was unclear whether these users had something else in common that affected their thinking and language, such as a cognitive style or personality trait.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It would also be interesting to look more deeply at the norms and jargons of particular forums and how these affect the way people write. Take another relationship-based subreddit, r/Relationships. Browsing the subreddit, you’ll often see the same kinds of language, structure and tone across posts, a standard way for people to write about their problems and challenges (often to fairly incongruous and amusing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/redditships&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;). Looking at the culture of individual forums could also give some insight into why and when people use the language they do, and how that language use relates to their own conceptualisation of their thoughts, feelings and lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/7/e2017154118&quot;&gt;Language left behind on social media exposes the emotional and cognitive costs of a romantic breakup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is an initiative to provide a ready to use Fedora based Free/Open source software platform for neuroscience.
We believe that similar to Free software, science should be free for all to use, share, modify, and study.
The use of Free software also aids reproducibility, data sharing, and collaboration in the research community.
By making the tools used in the scientific process easier to use, NeuroFedora aims to take a step to enable this ideal.
In this session, I will talk about the deliverables of the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; project and then go over the complete pipeline that we use to produce, test, and disseminate them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/obese-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have several anti-smoking policies in the UK in recent decades – the bans on indoor/workplace smoking, tobacco adverts around sports, and tobacco sales in vending machines, to name a few. Indeed, smoking has been the major target of public health interventions, and rightfully so given that it made the largest contribution to avoidable deaths. These public health interventions have been quite successful and, as a result, the number of smokers has been decreasing over the past 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more people with obesity and fewer who smoke, it is now of question whether smoking remains the top contributor to UK’s deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while smoking became less popular, we had more people with obesity. In 2003, 23% of people in England had obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and the number rises to 29% in 2017. Similar trends can also be observed in other nations in the UK. With more people with obesity and fewer who smoke, it is now of question whether smoking remains the top contributor to UK’s deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We answered this question in our research by synthesizing two sets of numbers. The first set is the yearly proportions of people with different levels of obesity, and those of current, former, and never smokers. We extracted these numbers from the Health Surveys for England and Scottish Health Surveys. These surveys recruited random samples of people in England and Scotland, making their findings more representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second set of numbers is what we called the risk ratios of obesity and smoking. Risk ratios quantify to which extent people with obesity and smokers are at higher risk of adverse health events, such as death. We extracted risk ratios from the latest meta-analysis studies, which should provide more robust estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12249&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12249&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/picblog-300x250.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Frederick K Ho et. al BMC Public Health&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining these two sets of numbers, we found that smoking contributed 23% of all deaths in 2003, and that number decreased to 19% in 2017 (Figure). Meanwhile obesity contributed 18% deaths in 2003 and that number increased to 23% in 2017. The contribution of obesity exceeded that of smoking in 2013. The general trends were consistent across age, sex, and education level. But for younger people under 45 years of age, smoking remained the larger contributor to deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should, however, be noted that the analysis assumed the risk ratios could accurately reflect the extent to which obesity and smoking causes death over the 15 years. In addition, our study only considered deaths, but the impact of obesity and smoking extends to chronic illnesses and disabilities. The legacy of smoking, such as vaping, electronic cigarettes, and passive smoking, have also not been accounted for. These can be further investigated when better and more recent data are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our analysis estimated obesity is now contributing to more deaths than smoking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historical efforts to protect the public from the harms of smoking have been successful. Our analysis estimated obesity is now contributing to more deaths than smoking, which highlights the need to focus our efforts to address it. This could include government policies and legislation to create an environment that can facilitate weight management, as well as interventions to support individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Climate change is a cause of serious concern for many — but that doesn’t mean anxiety about the planet is always at the top of people’s agendas. As we reported last year, the effectiveness of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/11/16/climate-change-appeals-may-be-more-effective-when-theyre-pessimistic/&quot;&gt;climate change appeals&lt;/a&gt; can vary considerably. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959378011000173&quot;&gt;other research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that worries about the environment can be displaced by other issues (fewer Americans reported concern about climate change after the 2008 financial crisis, for example). This latter phenomenon is known as the “finite pool of worry” hypothesis: that as some concerns creep up our radar, others become neglected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So with COVID-19 taking up space both in the media and in our minds, are people thinking less about climate change? According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/3/e2018936118.short?rss=1&quot;&gt;new study in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the answer is no: climate change is now such a major concern that even serious threats of another nature don’t diminish fears at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41352&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research conducted in April 2020 &lt;a href=&quot;https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-april-2020/&quot;&gt;in the US&lt;/a&gt; and in May 2019 to 2020 &lt;a href=&quot;https://cast.ac.uk/publications/&quot;&gt;in the UK&lt;/a&gt; first indicated that concerns about COVID-19 might be pushing out worries about the climate. But these studies suffered from small sample sizes, so in the new work Darrick Evensen from the University of Edinburgh and team looked at data from 1,858 UK participants taking part in a longitudinal study over the course of fourteen months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants indicated how much they believed climate change was real and caused by humans by responding to five statements such as “I am convinced that climate change is really happening” and “the media is often too alarmist about issues like climate change”. They also indicated how serious a threat they felt climate change was to themselves and their own family, to the UK as a whole, to people in developing countries, and to wildlife and ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than belief in or concern about climate change &lt;em&gt;diminishing &lt;/em&gt;over the fourteen month period, participants’ belief only seemed to strengthen: there was slightly more agreement in June 2020 that climate change was both real and caused by humans than there was at the start of the study (although the authors point out that the sizes of these effects were very small).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked whether COVID-19 was a bigger threat than climate change to the UK, the virus was seen to be very slightly more of a threat (43% compared to 42%). On a wider scale, however, this gap increased: 45% of participants saw climate change as a bigger threat to Europe (compared to 40% who saw COVID-19 as a bigger threat) and 55% saw climate change as a bigger threat to the world (versus 33% for COVID-19).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite such widespread concern, media coverage of climate change may not be making the impact one might hope. Participants were asked whether they had heard of several environment-related stories covered extensively in the news: youth climate strikes, Extinction Rebellion protests, the UK Climate Assembly, and wildfires in Australia, storms in the UK and melting glaciers in the Alps and Greenland. Increased knowledge of such stories did not have a significant correlation with how participants’ perception of  climate change severity changed over the 14 months — suggesting that media coverage itself is not increasing people’s concern about (or willingness to do something to combat) climate change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the team looked at around 124 million tweets sent from the UK to identify whether climate change or COVID-19 was receiving more attention from users. In this case, COVID-19 did seem to have an impact, with tweets about climate change decreasing during the period between March 2019 to August 2020. This may be related to how newsworthy the virus was — being concerned about something doesn’t necessarily mean tweeting about it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results suggest that the finite pool of worry hypothesis does not stand up when it comes to climate change. The team suggests that since prior research on the topic, the environment may have become a “permanent member of more people’s pool of worry” — something that just doesn’t budge, even when other concerns dominate. This may be good news: if we’re thinking about climate change we’re more likely to want to do something about it, whether on personal or structural levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lack of correlation between media coverage and perceived climate change severity, however, may need further research. If news stories about climate change aren’t making a difference, then what is? If not the media, what has altered people’s “pools of worry” so significantly since previous research? Exploring the answers to these questions could provide insights to campaigners, politicians and journalists alike.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/3/e2018936118.short&quot;&gt;– Effect of “finite pool of worry” and COVID-19 on UK climate change perceptions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a book!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As some of you may know, in summer of 2018 I signed a contract with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/non-fiction/popular-science/&quot;&gt;Bloomsbury Sigma&lt;/a&gt; to write a book about my area of research: computational neuroscience. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the term has many definitions, computational neuroscience is mainly about applying mathematics to the study of the brain. The brain—a jumble of all different kinds of neurons interconnected in countless ways that somehow produce consciousness—has been described as “the most complex object in the known universe”. Physicists for centuries have turned to mathematics to properly explain some of the most seemingly simple processes in the universe—how objects fall, how water flows, how the planets move. Equations have proved crucial in these endeavors because they capture relationships and make precise predictions possible.&lt;strong&gt; How could we expect to understand the most complex object in the universe without turning to mathematics? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The answer is we can’t, and that is why I wrote this book. While I’ve been studying and working in the field for over a decade, most people I encounter have no idea what “computational neuroscience” is or that it even exists. Yet a desire to understand how the brain works is a common and very human interest. I wrote this book to let people in on the ways in which the brain will ultimately be understood: through mathematical and computational theories.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I know that both mathematics and brain science are on their own intimidating topics to the average reader and may seem downright prohibitory when put together. That is why I’ve avoided (many) equations in the book and focused instead on the driving reasons why scientists have turned to mathematical modeling, what these models have taught us about the brain, and how some surprising interactions between biologists, physicists, mathematicians, and engineers over centuries have laid the groundwork for the future of neuroscience.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each chapter of &lt;em&gt;Models of the Mind&lt;/em&gt; covers a separate topic in neuroscience, starting from individual neurons themselves and building up to the different populations of neurons and brain regions that support memory, vision, movement and more. These chapters document the history of how mathematics has woven its way into biology and the exciting advances this collaboration has in store. &lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;’s array of publication options that push the boundaries of Open Science continues to expand. We’re happy to announce two new article types that improve reproducibility and transparency, and allow researchers to receive credit for their contributions to study design: &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/protocols/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lab Protocols &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Study Protocols&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These new article types complement other Open Science developments at &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/01/submit-your-registered-report-to-plos-one/&quot;&gt;Registered Reports&lt;/a&gt;, and support PLOS’ mission to accelerate progress in science and medicine. Adding reliable and accessible methods that can be built upon to the scientific record, Lab and Study Protocols support robust, reproducible science.  As reproducible science helps accelerate discoveries, such contributions deserve notice. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Protocols&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consisting of a single article published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, Study Protocols describe detailed plans and proposals for research projects that have not yet generated results. Sharing a study’s design and analysis plan before the research is conducted improves research quality by reducing the potential for bias, and credits researchers for the work that occurs prior to data collection. Additionally, studies that were peer reviewed as part of the funding process can be eligible for expedited publication. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Already well-established in health-related fields, we’re opening the format to the natural sciences, medicine, and engineering, as well as the related social sciences and humanities. In fact, both Lab and Study Protocols are open to submissions within &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;’s inclusive &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information#loc-scope&quot;&gt;scope&lt;/a&gt;, and are subject to our normal &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication&quot;&gt;publication criteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lab and Study Protocols from &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; provide new opportunities for researchers to gain more recognition for the work that goes into contributing detailed methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fplos.io%2FProtocolsIsHere&amp;amp;text=Lab%20and%20Study%20Protocols%20from%20@PLOSONE%20provide%20new%20opportunities%20for%20researchers%20to%20gain%20more%20recognition%20for%20the%20work%20that%20goes%20into%20contributing%20detailed%20methods.&amp;amp;hashtags=PLOSProtocols&quot;&gt;Share on Twitter! &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lab Protocols&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developed with researchers and in partnership with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://protocols.io&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt; team, Lab Protocols consist of two interlinked components that together describe &lt;em&gt;verified&lt;/em&gt;, reusable methods:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A step-by-step protocol on protocols.io, with access to specialized tools for communicating methodological details and facilitating use of the protocol, including reagents, measurements, formulae, video clips and dynamic flow charts. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;A peer-reviewed &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; article contextualizing the protocol, with sample datasets and sections discussing applications, limitations and expected results. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This two-part setup provides the best of both worlds for authors: the detailed, step-by-step guidance is held on protocol.io’s flexible open access platform, and the article in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE &lt;/em&gt;helps increase the visibility and discoverability of the protocol by making it an official part of the peer-reviewed publication record. The partnership with protocols.io supports authors by clearly communicating technical details in a user-friendly format to support reproducibility. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Access from the PLOS ONE article to protocols.io is seamless, via uniquely-created and clearly marked features of both platforms. The protocol and accompanying article are peer reviewed by subject experts. The method described in a Lab Protocol must have been shown to work in at least one peer-reviewed publication, so readers can be confident that the Lab Protocol will work as described.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lab Protocols are now open to submissions reporting verified methodologies and computational techniques.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it look like? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The protocol on protocols.io and the article on &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; work together to communicate details required to reproduce a study.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-18683&quot; height=&quot;1020&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/2021-02-08-14_57_29-PLOS-Protocols-PLOS-1024x1020.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the left is the protocol on protocols.io. With the details—steps—of the protocol portrayed through interactive features and special tools, authors can effectively communicate complicated lab instructions. On the right is the &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; article, providing context, assurance of peer review, and increased visibility for the protocol. Both elements of a Lab Protocol will be interlinked and available simultaneously, with peer review of both organised by &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; and its community of Academic Editors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuing to improve methods papers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks to our partnership with protocols.io, we’re able to offer authors enhanced functionality to share their protocols alongside the features from a peer-reviewed publication. We believe that researchers will really benefit from the dynamic functionality that protocols.io provides, helping pave the way for improved methods papers and increased reproducibility across disciplines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To help those who are trying protocols.io for the first time, authors of Lab Protocols at &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE &lt;/em&gt;can receive free support from the protocols.io editorial team to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocols.io/we-enter-protocols&quot;&gt;upload and format their protocols&lt;/a&gt; as part of the publication process in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ready to submit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To submit a Lab or Study Protocol, view &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;‘s &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication&quot;&gt;publication criteria&lt;/a&gt; and submit your article through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submit-now&quot;&gt;journal website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Note: The Copyright Clearance Center issued the following press release on their&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.copyright.com/plos-adopts-copyright-clearance-centers-rightslink-for-scientific-communications-to-manage-new-community-action-publishing-model/&quot;&gt; site &lt;/a&gt;earlier today&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot;&gt;The Public Library of Science&lt;/a&gt; (PLOS) announced today it is using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyright.com/publishers/rightslink-scientific/&quot;&gt;RightsLink® for Scientific Communications&lt;/a&gt; (RLSC) to manage its &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot;&gt;Community Action Publishing&lt;/a&gt; (CAP) model, which aims to eliminate author APCs in order to make  its OA journals truly Open to Read and Open to Publish.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are the first PLOS journals live on RLSC, the comprehensive scholarly communications workflow solution from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyright.com/&quot;&gt;Copyright Clearance Center, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; (CCC), a leader in advancing copyright, accelerating knowledge, and powering innovation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RLSC is used by PLOS to deliver a flexible, sophisticated workflow that enables authors to easily publish OA, whether or not they are funded under a formal PLOS publishing agreement. PLOS can also leverage the agreement management capabilities of RLSC to support emerging OA models such as the University of California multi-payer model, where the university and author share responsibility for funding APCs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We want to ensure all authors have the same freedom in choosing the best venue for their research,” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. “PLOS’ Community Action Publishing changes the way we think about selectivity and authorship for a more equitable OA future. Key to this is a friction-free author experiences that reduces the lift for authors around managing payments. RLSC has been critical to facilitating this.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re so pleased PLOS chose RLSC to support its new CAP model by automating the management, collection, and funding of manuscripts,” said Emily Sheahan, Vice President and Managing Director, Information and Content Services, CCC.  “In partnering with PLOS on this important initiative, CCC helps provide the scale and automation required to support the needs of a growing community of stakeholders.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS recently entered into agreements with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.btaa.org/&quot;&gt;Big Ten Academic Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crkn-rcdr.ca/en/home&quot;&gt;Canadian Research Knowledge Network&lt;/a&gt;,  premier higher education consortiums of top-tier research institutions in North America, for its members to participate in the CAP program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CCC just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.copyright.com/copyright-clearance-centers-rightslink-for-scientific-communications-increases-awareness-of-available-open-access-publication-funding-upon-manuscript-submission/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; new functionality for RLSC, including a capability to inform authors of available OA publication funding throughout the manuscript lifecycle, starting with submission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RLSC enables publishers, funders and institutions to support a variety of OA agreements. It accelerates the implementation of OA deals, including Read and Publish Agreements, Membership Deals, and more. Over 30 publishers rely on CCC’s sophisticated agreement management solution to serve over 800 global academic institutions, consortia, and funders – including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jisc.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;Jisc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mpg.de/en&quot;&gt;Max Planck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdlib.org/&quot;&gt;California Digital Library&lt;/a&gt;. CCC’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyright.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Open-Access-Workflow-Services_Service-Sheet_November-2020.pdf&quot;&gt;Open Access Workflow Services&lt;/a&gt;, a comprehensive consulting practice providing strategic OA institutional agreement workflow support, helps organizations deliver on each agreement’s unique needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CCC is an active partner in the information industry’s evolution of hybrid and pure Open Access publishing models. For years CCC has brought together key Open Access stakeholders from the author, publisher, institution, funding, and vendor communities through roundtables, panel events, webinars, podcasts, and published pieces. CCC is a member of &lt;a href=&quot;https://oaspa.org/&quot;&gt;OASPA&lt;/a&gt; (Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alpsp.org/&quot;&gt;ALPSP&lt;/a&gt; (Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stm-assoc.org/&quot;&gt;STM&lt;/a&gt; (International Association of STM Publishers) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sspnet.org/&quot;&gt;SSP&lt;/a&gt; (Society for Scholarly Publishing).&lt;/p&gt;

 Last year, Naunyn-Schmiedeberg’s Archives of Pharmacology found itself on the receiving end of what its editor Roland Seifert called a “massive attack of fraudulent papers” that were the product of paper mills.  In response Seifert — who says the journal ultimately will have retracted 10 of those articles and stopped another 30 from being published … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2021/02/09/20-ways-to-spot-the-work-of-paper-mills/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;20 ways to spot the work of paper mills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/ourmembers&quot;&gt;Member institutions&lt;/a&gt; now have &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_usage&quot;&gt;a new way to view their arXiv usage data&lt;/a&gt;. On arXiv.org, the number of downloads by institution is provided in searchable tables and graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universities, libraries, and research institutes want to support the platforms, tools, and resources that are most valuable to their constituents. By providing various types of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_usage&quot;&gt;usage statistics&lt;/a&gt;, arXiv aims to help members and other stakeholders understand arXiv’s value, as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_886&quot; style=&quot;width: 974px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2020_usage&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot of institutional downloads by subject area&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-886 size-full&quot; height=&quot;847&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/AccessDownloadStats-1.png&quot; width=&quot;974&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Institutions can now view their usage statistics this way. To search for a specific domain, hover over the area designated with the purple arrow to reveal the search icon.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To download your institution’s data, you can select the institution or domain of interest, then click download, as indicated by the purple arrows in the screenshot below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_909&quot; style=&quot;width: 945px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot of member downloads with arrows to download function&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-909 size-full&quot; height=&quot;386&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/Member-Downloads-Tableau-Screen-Shot-2021-02-09.png&quot; width=&quot;945&quot; /&gt;To download the data, select the url or institution of interest, then click “download,” as indicated by the purple arrows in this screenshot.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our community knows, arXiv is open, above all. Readers can access articles without logging in. Authors need only meet minimal requirements to submit articles. This central tenet of openness makes measuring usage by specific communities challenging. The usage presented in the new format is compiled from data based on institutional domains and IP address ranges, and it does have limitations. For example, most people access arXiv from locations other than their research libraries. Providing new ways to view usage data is an ongoing process and feedback is always welcome at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:membership@arXiv.org&quot;&gt;membership@arXiv.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv’s 243 members and affiliates worldwide support the organization by contributing about 25% of the operating budget, fulfilling the Simons Foundation matching funds requirement, and contributing to governance through the Member Advisory Board. If your institution is a member, thank you! For organizations that are not yet members, we encourage you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/membership&quot;&gt;learn more about membership&lt;/a&gt; and consider supporting arXiv’s mission to provide an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant, emerging science, and establish their contribution to advancing research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you’re going through a period of anxiety or depression it can be difficult to make decisions, whether those are significant life changes or more mundane, everyday choices about prioritising tasks or time management. And those with generalised anxiety disorder or mood disorders often report feeling uncomfortable with or distressed by feelings of uncertainty — which doesn’t help when you need to make a decision, big or small.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/61387&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;, Christopher Gagne from UC Berkeley and colleagues find that people with higher levels of anxiety and depression are less able to adapt to fast-changing situations. But the authors suggest that with the right intervention there may be ways to not only mitigate this distress, but to help those with anxiety or depression make better decisions in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41340&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were aged between 18 and 55; some had diagnoses of generalised anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder, some had &lt;em&gt;symptoms&lt;/em&gt; of both or either disorder but no formal diagnosis, while others had no history of mental illness at all. Those taking medication were excluded from the study, as were those with other diagnoses including OCD, PTSD and bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, after filling in measures related to anxiety, depression, worry and personality, 86 participants took part in a video game. In each round, they were asked to choose between two shapes: picking one shape resulted in a small monetary reward, while the other delivered an electric shock ranging from mild to moderate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The task took place in two blocks — one stable, in which one shape was associated with a reward 75% of the time and the other 25% of the time, and one volatile, in which the shape with a higher probability of resulting in reward switched every twenty trials. In the volatile blocks, therefore, the participants had to keep adjusting their responses as the probabilities change..&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those participants who either had a diagnosis of depression or anxiety, or who exhibited higher levels of associated symptoms, were slower to adjust their responses to the changes in probabilities. This suggests that mood disorders are associated with difficulties making decisions in changing circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second experiment replicated the first — only this time, instead of being shocked when they chose the wrong shape, participants lost money. And, again, results showed that those with symptoms of anxiety or depression were slower to adapt to changing rules in the face of unpredictability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean for those with anxiety and depression when faced with a big decision? Senior author Sonia Bishop &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/12/22/in-shaky-times-focus-on-past-successes-if-overly-anxious-depressed/&quot;&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; that those participants who adapted quickly did so because of their emotional resilience. “Emotionally resilient people tend to focus on what gave them a good outcome, and in many real-world situations that might be key to learning to make good decisions,” she says. Bishop’s previous research has found similar results: in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25730669/&quot;&gt;one 2015 study&lt;/a&gt;, those with anxiety were more likely to make mistakes in decision-making in rapidly changing circumstances, while those with low levels of anxiety were able to quickly adapt to the task.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team suggests that cognitive-based therapies which encourage people to focus on past successes rather than failures could therefore be a useful behavioural intervention, making those difficult decisions that bit less tricky.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/61387&quot;&gt;Impaired adaptation of learning to contingency volatility in internalizing psychopathology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s report differs from &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/reports&quot;&gt;past updates and reports&lt;/a&gt; in that it combines the year in review and the budget into a single document. arXiv values transparency, and with this new format, we aim to keep the community well-informed about our activities.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gratitude is widely regarded as a positive emotion. When we feel grateful, we are more helpful, generous and fair to others — findings that were supported by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-16711-001&quot;&gt;2017 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, which concluded that gratitude is important for building relationships. But now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-99648-001&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt; suggests that gratitude has a dark side. Specifically, people who felt more grateful were more willing to accede to an instruction to prepare as many worms as possible for grinding to their death. As Eddie M. W. Tong at the National University of Singapore and his colleagues write: “The findings suggest that gratitude can make a person more vulnerable to social influence, including obeying commands to perform a questionable act.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41333&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team started with a study of 96 student participants, who individually recalled and wrote about either a happy event or an occasion on which they’d felt grateful (or their morning routine; an emotionally neutral event). After then rating their current feelings of gratitude and happiness, each participant was led to a coffee grinder and 20 little cups, each of which contained a live mealworm. The experimenter — a final year student who kept things formal and avoided small talk — switched on the grinder, to demonstrate that it worked, and said: “What I want you to do now is to pour as many worms as you can within 30 seconds into this grinder to grind the worms.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What the participants were not told was that a stopper was inserted part way down, so that the worms could not drop to the blades. (“No worms were harmed,” the team notes.) Anyone who objected was “sternly” instructed to continue with the task. (Across four studies with a total of 623 participants, only one refused to insert any worms; all participants were fully debriefed afterwards.) The team found that participants who’d reported feeling more grateful packed in more worms than those who felt happier, suggesting that it was gratitude, specifically, rather than feeling some kind of positive emotion, that increased the number of worms they were willing to slaughter. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In subsequent studies, the team modified the experiment, though the worm-grinding element stayed the same. They found that participants who were made to feel more grateful to the experimenter specifically (by being informed that the experimenter had picked a desirable rather than boring task for them to complete), were also willing to harm more worms. However, feelings of admiration for the experimenter made no difference to the number of worms sent to their doom — so admiration for an authority figure did not seem to be playing a role in driving the participants’ obedience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A final study suggested that people who feel grateful feel a stronger desire to keep their relationships harmonious — which can explain why they are more likely to obey other people’s requests. Some participants who’d been induced to feel gratitude were also told that while social harmony is important, other things should sometimes take priority. This reduced the number of worms that they put in the grinder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, gratitude-enhanced obedience could be a good thing. A grateful and more obedient child would be more likely to obey a parent’s request to clean their bedroom, for example. But if the request — or command — is immoral (or even just questionable), then greater obedience is clearly undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have found that a desire to affiliate with others does encourage us to be more accommodating of other people’s wishes. “However, the current findings go beyond prior literature by showing gratitude facilities obedience and consequently may contribute to repugnant actions that violate moral values,” the team writes. (When questioned afterwards, almost all the participants reporting believing that the worms really were going to be ground, they note.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How might this translate into the real world? As the team suggests, it’s possible that an extremist group or gang that provides a sense of belonging or physical protection to a new recruit may gain that individual’s gratitude — which could then increase their willingness to obey a morally questionable command. Whether or not they would actually obey a command to go so far as to hurt another person as a result of this gratitude is a different matter. “However,” the researchers write, “minimally, the studies might indicate that gratitude can render one more likely to commit small, harmful acts perceived as trivial on command.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-99648-001&quot;&gt;Gratitude facilitates obedience: New evidence for the social alignment perspective.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/calories-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrition labeling is an effective tool used by manufacturers and retailers to improve the public health, and its framework has been of importance to governments and policy makers. The front of pack nutrition labeling is part of United Kingdom government`s program of activities aiming to tackle diet-related diseases. There are several front of pack labeling formats available and they differ in the information they deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five hundred food products in five categories [(1) cereals and cereal products, (2) dairy products, (3) beverages, (4) packaged meats and meat products, and (5) pre-packaged fruits and vegetables] from three main United Kingdom retail websites were investigated. A simple random sampling method was used for product selection and, the types of the front of pack labels and levels of healthiness of the foods were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dominant front of pack labeling formats in the UK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12266&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12266&quot; height=&quot;218&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/blog-Word-300x218.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Daniel A. Ogundijo et. al. BMC Public Health&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traffic light rating system (TLRS) and Guideline Daily Amount (GDA) are believed to provide at-a-glance nutrition information to consumers at the point of purchase and help consumers to choose food products based on their health and nutrition needs. The nutrition information displayed on the front of pack labels allowed food products to be grouped according to their levels of healthiness. The TLRS and GDA are the most common labeling formats that are used in the UK. As seen in the figure below, a combination of TLRS/GDA and TLRS/Health logos were dominant on the assessed food labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The levels of healthiness of foods in the UK retail market&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healthiness of foods was assessed by categorizing the food products into ‘healthier’, ’moderately healthy’ and ‘least healthy’ based on fat, saturated fat, salt, and sugar contents. Red means the food is high in one of these and should be eaten less often or in smaller amounts. Amber means the food contains medium amount (neither high nor low) and may be eaten more frequently. Green indicates that the food is low in these nutrients and therefore is a healthier choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food manufacturers are now responding to the trends that are driven by the public`s demand for the wider availability of healthier foods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found out that a higher number of assessed products belonged to the “moderately healthy” and “healthier” categories than the “least healthy”. This could suggest that food manufacturers are now responding to the trends that are driven by the public`s demand for the wider availability of healthier foods. The imported foods that were found in the United Kingdom retail market also showed that healthier food choices could be made from the diverse food types around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

 Berlin, February 8th, 2021: Knowledge Unlatched (KU), the central platform for Open Access (OA) financing models, is pleased to announce the results of 2020 pledging round, which ended in December 2020 and once again saw hundreds of libraries worldwide pledge support for OA book and journal initiatives offered by KU and its partners.

Overall, about 310 books and 34 journals will be published OA in 2021. These include 240 books from the KU Select 2020 HSS Books Collection and 65 books from KU’s partner collections. In addition, 31 journals will be flipped to OA thanks to two ground-breaking Subscribe-to-Open (S2O) projects: Pluto Open Journals and IWAP Open Journals.</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is an initiative to provide a ready to use Fedora based Free/Open source software platform for neuroscience.
We believe that similar to Free software, science should be free for all to use, share, modify, and study.
The use of Free software also aids reproducibility, data sharing, and collaboration in the research community.
By making the tools used in the scientific process easier to use, NeuroFedora aims to take a step to enable this ideal.
In this session, I will talk about the deliverables of the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; project and then go over the complete pipeline that we use to produce, test, and disseminate them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://briansimulator.org/&quot;&gt;Brian Simulator&lt;/a&gt; is a free, open-source simulator for spiking neural networks, written in Python.
It provides researchers with the means to express any kind of neural model in mathematical notation and takes care of translating these model descriptions into efficient executable code.
During this dev session I will first give a quick introduction to the simulator itself and its code generation mechanism.
I will then walk through Brian’s code structure, our automatic systems for tests and documentation, and demonstrate how we work on its development.
The Brian simulator welcome contributions on many levels, hopefully this dev session will give you an idea where to start.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluejeans, do we want to record? For &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SIG&lt;/span&gt; meetings, we agreed to use BlueJeans with recordings enabled on for members to refer to later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we need breakout rooms? We agreed that breakout rooms may be needed during tutorials/developer sessions and so can be decided on a per-session basis. These are not expected to be needed at regular &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WG&lt;/span&gt; progress meetings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;guidelines-progress&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Guidelines progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The source repository is here on GitHub: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareDevelopmentGuidelines&quot;&gt;https://github.com/&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OCNS&lt;/span&gt;/SoftwareDevelopmentGuidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, we agreed that the style of the guidelines should be to advise readers, not to force them to follow listed suggestions. Readers will choose the right practices that suit their project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first version will contain high level suggestions and will be targeted at beginners. More technical, detailed guidelines will be added later for advanced users.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, we will mention the presence of PEPs for Python and suggest ones that projects should follow. However, we will stress that not all PEPs are to be followed as rules. Rather, it is more important to adopt a set of relevant PEPs and apply them consistently in the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The guidelines will aid readers in choosing the right license for their project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The guidelines will also help readers document their projects, for their users and potential contributors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WG&lt;/span&gt; discussed the possibility of taking on more teaching focussed tasks, for example, in collaboration with the Software Carpentry and/or Code Coderefinery projects.
The &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;INCF&lt;/span&gt; training space’s study tracks can also be used for such activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead of putting on a brave face in front of your kids, you might want to consider putting on a “brave voice”.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s according to research from Paddy Ross and team, who find that children tend to focus on the emotion in people’s voices more than the emotion in their body language. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/why-your-kids-know-when-youre-trying-to-put-on-a-brave-face-154152&quot;&gt;Ross describes the work&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41319&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;has published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/heres-what-learning-juggle-does-your-brain/&quot;&gt;fascinating extract from Tom Vanderbilt’s book&lt;/a&gt; “Beginners: The Joy and Transformative Power of Lifelong Learning”.&lt;/strong&gt; In the piece, Vanderbilt describes his experience of learning to juggle — and discusses what this process reveals about the way humans learn new skills.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The coronavirus pandemic has affected the entire population in one way or another: even those of us fortunate enough not to have caught the virus have still had our lives turned upside-down.  &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210203-after-the-covid-19-pandemic-how-will-we-heal&quot;&gt;Ed Prideaux explores&lt;/a&gt; how we might deal with the lingering effects of this “mass trauma” once the pandemic over.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meanwhile, over at &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/beat-the-burnout-how-to-fight-pandemic-fatigue-with-science/&quot;&gt;Amy Fleming examines&lt;/a&gt; strategies for dealing with “COVID burnout”: the fatigue and feelings of stagnation that many of us are experiencing. &lt;/strong&gt;Social support, maintaining a sense of a control, and getting regular exercise are all important, Fleming writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earlier this week &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/03/supposed-benefits-of-psychedelic-microdosing-to-mental-health-may-actually-reflect-strong-placebo-response/&quot;&gt;we wrote about&lt;/a&gt; the lack of evidence behind the idea that microdosing psychedelic drugs can have a positive impact on mental health. But when it comes to larger doses, there is a fair amount of preliminary evidence that these substances could be useful.&lt;/strong&gt; At &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/psychedelics-as-antidepressants/&quot;&gt;researcher Austin Lim takes a look at the current state of the field&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donald Trump is no longer in office — but his amplification of conspiracy theories has had long-lasting political and social effects.&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers who specialise in the spread of misinformation are now left trying to make sense of it all, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00257-y&quot;&gt;reports Jeff Tollefson&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, researchers have mapped out how electrical brain stimulation can give rise to various emotions&lt;/strong&gt;. The team stimulated several different brain areas in a woman who was receiving deep brain stimulation for depression. Some of those sites produced a positive or pleasant response, but others produced feelings of “doom and gloom”, apathy, and even sickness, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/brain-stimulations-complex-emotional-effects&quot;&gt;reports Neuroskeptic&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the second of several planned for 2021, these workshops – co-hosted by the NIH BRAIN Initiative and the NIH Blueprint – will bring together experts to explore emerging questions on the upcoming ramp-up of the NIH BRAIN Initiative’s cell census and atlas-ing efforts. Please join us on Feb. 9-11, 2021!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-3022&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research&lt;/a&gt;, the NIH BRAIN Initiative is sponsoring an exciting three-part virtual series. These upcoming workshops seek input on best practices and recommendations to ensure a dependable supply of high-quality human brain tissue for the ramp-up of the NIH BRAIN Initiative’s cell census and atlas-ing efforts of the human brain. Additionally, these workshops align with recently announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://brainupdate.nih.gov/2021/01/15/increase-to-funds-and-anticipated-awards-for-brain-initiative-cell-census-network-biccn-scalable-technologies-and-tools/&quot;&gt;Congressional support&lt;/a&gt; for The Human Brain Cell Atlas, one of the transformative projects outlined in &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/images/brain_2.0_6-6-19-final_revised10302019_508c.pdf&quot;&gt;BRAIN 2.0: From Cells to Circuits, Toward Cures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sessions will be hosted on Zoom and are open to anyone, although you will need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://roseliassociates.zoomgov.com/meeting/register/vJItfuCprT4vHF2VbXSpS9_nIymGAZA_0qI&quot;&gt;register to attend&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;external link&quot; class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540&quot; style=&quot;height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;&quot; title=&quot;This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/Animal-Shelter-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many of us love animals and think of our pets as part of the family? Well, what if I told you that among the 6-8 million animals that enter the rescue shelters every year, nearly 3-4 million (i.e., 50% of the incoming animals) are euthanized. Even more heartbreaking is that 10% – 25% of them are put to death specifically because of shelter overcrowding each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of overpopulation of domestic animals continues to rise, leaving shelters faced with the challenge of how to increase adoption rates. Though animal shelters provide incentives such as reduced adoption fees and sterilizing animals before adoption, only a quarter of total animals living in the shelter are adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 6-8 million animals that enter rescue shelters every year, nearly 3-4 million are euthanized&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These staggering statistics led us to investigate the length of stay of animals at shelters and the factors influencing the rate of animal adoption. The overarching goal of this study was to use these factors to predict and then minimize how long an animal will stay in a shelter, thereby decreasing the number of animals euthanized due to overcrowding. Several steps must be conducted to accomplish this goal, such as a literature search for the factors, collection of data from databases and animal shelters, and utilizing machine learning algorithms on this data to make predictions on length of stay in the shelters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-12273 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;209&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/animal-rescue-300x209.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer the question of what factors influence the length of stay, a thorough literature review was conducted. Several factors were found to influence the length of stay including color, gender, breed, animal type, and age. To make the predictions about the length of stay using these factors, we evaluated using machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is just the ability to program computers to learn and improve by itself using training experience. The developed system needs to analyze big data, quickly deliver accurate and repeatable results, and adapt to new data. A system can be trained to make accurate predictions by learning from examples of desired input-output data. In other words, we wanted to utilize a labeled data set with the output (length of stay) already known, so that the computer could learn from it. The next step was to obtain this data from databases and animal shelters across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12274 size-medium aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/Machine-learning-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data that was collected from the databases and animal shelters included information such as animal type, intake and outcome date, gender, color, breed, and intake and outcome status (behavior of animal entering the shelter and behavior of animal at outcome type). These data sets included information from mostly southern and southwestern states. For the length of stay, the categories included “low”, “medium”, “high”, and “very high” (euthanized).  Once the data was collected and cleaned, it was time to input it into the machine learning algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many different types of algorithms that can be used on a data set to make predictions. The hard part is determining which algorithm will perform the best on the given data set, as the performance of the models depends on the application. Simple classification algorithms such as logistic regression, artificial neural network, gradient boosting, and random forest were used in this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examining the results, the most proficient predictive model was developed by the gradient boosting algorithm for this dataset, followed by the random forest algorithm. The logistic regression algorithm appeared to have the worst performance metrics for all categories of length of stay. What was interesting was that the gradient boosting and random forest algorithms performed well when predicting the very high length of stay or when the outcome was euthanization at around 70-80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12270&quot; style=&quot;width: 522px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12270 size-full&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/Blog_Shelters.png&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Age vs. Days in Shelter for Cats and Dogs&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the results from the exploratory data above, it was observed that the number of days a dog stays in the shelter decreases as the age increases. This was not expected, as it is predicted that the number of days in a shelter would be lower for younger dogs and puppies. This observation could be due to having more data points for younger dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that age, size, and color have a significant impact or influence on the length of stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting result from the study was the top features or factors from each machine learning algorithm. Results showed that age (senior, super senior, and puppy), size (large and small), and color (multicolor) have a significant impact or influence on the length of stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For future studies, a prescriptive analytics approach will be utilized. Not only is our goal to increase adoption rates of pets in animal shelters, but to also determine the optimal animal shelter location where the animal will have the least amount stay in a shelter and most likely be adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Damien Drix will talk about a paper &quot;Rapid online learning and robust recall in a neuromorphic olfactory circuit&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a neural algorithm for the rapid online learning and identification
of odourant samples under noise, based on the architecture of the mammalian
olfactory bulb and implemented on the Intel Loihi neuromorphic system. As with
biological olfaction, the spike timing-based algorithm utilizes distributed,
event-driven computations and rapid (one shot) online learning. Spike
timing-dependent plasticity rules operate iteratively over sequential
gamma-frequency packets to construct odour representations from the activity of
chemosensor arrays mounted in a wind tunnel. Learned odourants then are
reliably identified despite strong destructive interference. Noise resistance
is further enhanced by neuromodulation and contextual priming. Lifelong
learning capabilities are enabled by adult neurogenesis. The algorithm is
applicable to any signal identification problem in which high-dimensional
signals are embedded in unknown backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We (INCF) have, as of this morning, officially applied to Google as a mentoring organization in 2021. This is our 11th time. We have a &lt;a data-id=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/14wnNV-cIqTIF3eE9QJXtkwyW7lQomUiCLVVPFafX6Js/edit?usp=sharing&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/14wnNV-cIqTIF3eE9QJXtkwyW7lQomUiCLVVPFafX6Js/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Project Ideas list&lt;/a&gt; of 55 projects from 27 mentor teams, a new record!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step is interacting with prospective students, and waiting for Google’s announcement of this year’s accepted mentor organizations (March 9). Since a few years back, we post all project ideas on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurostars.org/c/gsoc/5&quot;&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier  for students and mentors to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Thick yarn makes for a quick knit. I am already finished with the Gunhild cardigan, a month before the agreed deadline. Slight stumbling block on the way; I ran out of main colour yarn after doing some modifications. And it wasn’t to be had anywhere in Europe, and out of stock at the supplier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But I had bought some extra contrast color yarn, so I ended up doing half sleeves in the contrast color, and not just the edging. With extra long sleeves, which I like. And I sewed in a button so it would be wearable without a shawl pin for closure.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<updated>2021-02-04T13:44:25+00:00</updated>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that people learn better when taught in a way that matches their specific “learning style” — auditory, kinesthetic, visual or some combination of the three — is widely considered a myth. Research has variously suggested that learners &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/03/another-nail-in-the-coffin-for-learning-styles-students-did-not-benefit-from-studying-according-to-their-supposed-learning-style/&quot;&gt;don’t actually benefit&lt;/a&gt; from their preferred style, that teachers and pupils have &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/12/an-additional-reason-to-abandon-learning-styles-teachers-and-pupils-do-not-agree-on-the-pupils-preferred-learning-style/&quot;&gt;different ideas&lt;/a&gt; about what learning styles actually work for them, and that we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/05/it-feels-as-though-we-learn-better-via-our-preferred-learning-style-but-we-dont/&quot;&gt;very little insight&lt;/a&gt; into how much we’re actually learning from various methods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite this evidence, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/07/20/oh-dear-even-people-with-neuroscience-training-believe-an-awful-lot-of-brain-myths/&quot;&gt;large proportion of people&lt;/a&gt; — including the general public, educators and even those with a background in neuroscience — still believe in the myth. And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.602451/full&quot;&gt;new review&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Education&lt;/em&gt;, finds no signs of that changing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41302&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team looked at articles that focused on belief in learning styles published between 2009 and April 2020. Articles with participant groups that were not made up of educators or trainee educators were excluded from analysis, as were surveys that focused not on whether learning styles actually existed but on other opinions — whether they explain differences in achievement, for example. Data from over 15,000 educators were included in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, 89.1% of participants believed that people learn better when instruction is matched to their learning styles. A total of 95.4% of trainee educators believed in learning styles — slightly higher than the 87.8% of qualified educators who showed similar beliefs. And despite more widespread debunking of the myth, both in academic publishing and the mainstream media, there was no significant decrease in belief in studies conducted more recently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This had a real impact on how teachers worked: in the seven studies that measured use or planned use of learning style-matched teaching, 79.7% of educators said they used or intended to use matched teaching methods. Interventions designed to disavow educators of their belief in learning styles did seem to make some difference, however — in the four studies that utilised training for these purposes, belief decreased significantly, from 78.4% to 37.1%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The myth of learning styles, it seems, is as pervasive as ever. But &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; educators continue to believe in them is less clear. It may be that the belief is heavily promoted during teacher training; it could be that teachers are working with their students as their teachers worked with them; or it could be that attempts to debunk the myth have simply not been high profile enough, failing to cut through to educators.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But researchers could also do with improving research into the prevalence of learning style myths, the team suggests. Many studies included in the analysis had no key indicators of the quality of survey responses, raising questions about the generalisability of findings. “None of the studies use a defined, representative sample, and very few include sufficient information to allow the calculation of a response rate,” the team writes. The questionnaires used in the studies could also be clearer about exactly what it means to “match” instruction to learning styles, the authors add.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future research could also look at the &lt;em&gt;consequences&lt;/em&gt; of learning style-matched teaching — does it actually matter if the myth is perpetuated, and does it have a serious impact on how people learn? Studying how training can educate teachers on the learning style myth could also help us understand how it spreads and why it sticks — and might help students get the most out of education at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.602451/full&quot;&gt;How Common Is Belief in the Learning Styles Neuromyth, and Does It Matter? A Pragmatic Systematic Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.connectedpapers.com/&quot;&gt;Connected Papers&lt;/a&gt; and now released as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXivLabs&lt;/a&gt; collaboration, the tool links to interactive visualizations of similar articles. Connected Papers graphs can help readers explore a visual overview of a new academic field, create a bibliography, discover the most relevant prior and derivative works of a paper, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers will find the feature below an article abstract in the “Related Papers” tab, as shown below. By activating the Connected Papers toggle switch, readers can follow a link to the article’s graph displayed at Connected Papers. Each paper’s graph is created by analyzing tens of thousands of papers for similarity in their citations, and then a small subset of those analyzed are arranged according to their degree of similarity. Each node in the graph represents an article, which has its own set of connected papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Connected Papers started as a weekend side project between friends, to solve our own problems with literature reviews,” said Eddie Smolyansky, co-founder of Connected Papers. “We can’t believe how quickly the scientific community embraced the tool and we’re so excited to be featured on arXiv – a website that we use daily in our own research. With this kind of support, we plan to keep improving Connected Papers and to build more tools for the academic community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework enabling innovative collaborations with individuals and organizations to bring innovative tools to the arXiv community, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;we welcome new proposals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An increasingly large body of work suggests that many illicit psychoactive drugs could be useful as treatments for certain mental health problems. Studies have found, for instance, that the psychedelics psilocybin (from magic mushrooms) and LSD can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00187-9&quot;&gt;reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression&lt;/a&gt;, while MDMA may be useful in treating PTSD.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a different story for a practice known as “microdosing”, however. This involves taking a small quantity of a psychedelic substance — normally too little to produce any perceptible effects — repeatedly over a period of time (every few days for several weeks, say). And &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/08/14/lack-of-scientific-proof-that-microdosing-psychedelic-drugs-improves-wellbeing-or-creativity/&quot;&gt;as we reported in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, although results from some surveys or poorly-controlled trials suggest that microdosing can improve people’s mood or certain aspects of cognition, more rigorous placebo-controlled trials have failed to find any such effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81446-7&quot;&gt;new study in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; could explain why. The team, led by Laura Kartner from Imperial College London, finds that people who plan on microdosing do go on to experience a boost to wellbeing and a reduction in anxiety and depression. But the level of improvement depends on how much they &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;/em&gt; to improve in the first place, suggesting that any effects on wellbeing may be the result of a strong placebo response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41297&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 253 people who were planning on microdosing a psychedelic drug such as psilocybin, LSD, or ayahuasca. In the week before the participants began microdosing, they completed a survey about their expectations, indicating how confident they were that the experience would have a positive effect, for instance, and how successful they thought it would be in improving their wellbeing. They also completed a number of other scales, including measures of wellbeing, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and personality traits. Then, once they began microdosing, participants completed weekly measures of wellbeing, depression, and anxiety, and recorded how much of the drug they had taken and whether they had experienced any psychoactive effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that after participants started microdosing, their wellbeing increased and symptoms of depression and anxiety decreased. Most of these effects emerged in the first week of taking the drugs, then remained at a similar level for the rest of the four week period. But, importantly, their expectations in the week before beginning to take the drug predict the extent of these changes: those who had a greater expectation that microdosing would produce positive effects tended to show more positive changes in all three measures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it might seem like the study supports the use of microdosing. But the fact that people’s expectations were tied to their response suggests that what seems like a useful therapeutic effect might actually be a placebo effect, driven by what participants want or expect to occur. That could explain why previous placebo-controlled studies have found that microdosing doesn’t produce any beneficial response beyond that of a placebo. Of course, in this case there was no placebo arm of the study, so it’s impossible to tell for sure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors also posit one other intriguing possibility: that the drugs do produce a pharmacological effect in the brain at this low dose, but this doesn’t boost wellbeing — instead, it actually accentuates the placebo response. For instance, microdosing might promote “plasticity” in the brain — the ability to reorganise networks and form new pathways — and this could potentially make any expectation effects even more pronounced. Again, only well-controlled trials will be able to determine whether that’s the case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whatever’s going on in the brain during microdosing, it’s clearly worth further examination. But as this study shows, in the absence of more rigorous research, there’s good reason to be sceptical of bold claims about the benefits of microdosing to people’s mental health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81446-7&quot;&gt;Positive expectations predict improved mental-health outcomes linked to psychedelic microdosing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; long. I know, I know, people will complain, but that is what I do. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Any brave soul willing to give it a go but who (like me) does not like to read long documents on the screen may like to print it out as a folded book. I have long used the Blue Squirrel software &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bluesquirrel.com/products/clickbook/&quot;&gt;ClickBook&lt;/a&gt; to do this. Alternatively, you can print booklets directly from word processing software like Word, and I am happy to send over a Word file to anyone who would like to do that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, the eBook is available as a pdf file &lt;a href=&quot;https://richardpoynder.co.uk/Jaws.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rick Anderson has published a summary of and commentary on this eBook on &lt;i&gt;The Scholarly Kitchen&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/11/25/the-tyranny-of-unintended-consequences-richard-poynder-on-open-access-and-the-open-access-movement/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;A second post on &lt;i&gt;The Scholarly Kitchen&lt;/i&gt; referencing this eBook was posted 10 days later &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/12/05/tldr-that-is-too-long-didnt-read/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

As we did not have time to discuss them all during the interview, I decided to publish my answers on my blog. With the greater space available I also took the opportunity to expatiate at considerable length in doing so. This turned into another eBook!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please note that what I say in the attached document is built on an interview. It is not intended to be any kind of prediction of the future; it is more an extended reflection after 20 years reporting on the OA movement, coupled with a heavy dose of speculation. Who knows, perhaps this will be the last thing I ever write on open access. Maybe this will prove my swan song.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I would also like to stress upfront that in the critique of the OA movement I make I don’t claim that my knowledge, or predictions, are superior to anyone else’s. This is just what I have concluded after many years observing the movement and reflects my current view on where I think we are today. It does also include a lot of factual data, as well as links and footnotes for those who like them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Importantly, while I do not consider myself to be an OA advocate, I admit that I was as naïve as anyone else about what the movement might be able to achieve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, while what I say might be slightly overweight in European developments, it may not matter if (as I believe is possible) events in Europe end up determining how open access develops globally. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I say this because it seems possible that European OA initiatives will reconfigure the international scholarly communication system, and in ways that OA advocates will not be comfortable with. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I would add that the main focus is on science publishing rather than HSS. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;To read/download my new eBook please click &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/information-wants-to-be-free_20210101/mode/2up&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;The file can also be downloaded &lt;a href=&quot;https://richardpoynder.co.uk/Information_Wants_to_be_Free.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As anyone who’s ever flunked a test will tell you, doing well at school or university isn’t just a simple matter of intelligence, ability, or even of how hard you’ve worked. In fact, there are plenty of things that can affect the way we perform, from the way we &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/04/what-do-todays-students-get-right-and-wrong-in-how-they-take-lecture-notes/&quot;&gt;take notes&lt;/a&gt; to how we &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/10/these-two-revision-strategies-can-prepare-you-for-an-exam-much-better-than-just-restudying-your-notes/&quot;&gt;revise&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/10/for-faster-learning-and-longer-retention-interleave-study-sessions-with-sleep/&quot;&gt;how much sleep we get&lt;/a&gt; while we’re studying.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-30956-001&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: General&lt;/em&gt;, something else might have an impact on our educational achievements: our assumptions about our professors. If we believe they have faith in our ability to change and improve, suggest Katherine Muenks from the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues, we’re likely to enjoy classes more, as well as achieve higher grades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41286&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research focused on participants’ beliefs about mindset. Those with a &lt;em&gt;fixed &lt;/em&gt;mindset believe that intelligence or ability is innate and can’t be changed; those with a &lt;em&gt;growth&lt;/em&gt; mindset believe that ability is malleable, and that if we work hard or adopt new strategies we will grow and learn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that our own mindset is likely to have an impact on how we behave, how motivated we feel, and what we achieve. But the new study looked at how students’ perceptions of their STEM professors’ mindset affected their experience and engagement in classes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first experiment, participants watched a short video clip from the first day of a university calculus course in which a professor expressed his beliefs about what it took to do well in the class. In one condition, the professor expressed beliefs suggesting a fixed mindset (“You either have the skills or you don’t”), in another expressed growth mindset beliefs (“The assignments are designed to help you improve your skills”), and in the third expressed no mindset beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those who watched the fixed mindset video anticipated feeling significantly less belonging and less engagement in the class than those who were shown the growth mindset video, and expressed more concerns about being evaluated negatively. Meanwhile, those who watched the growth mindset video anticipated higher engagement in and effort towards the class than either the fixed mindset group or the control group, and expected to perform significantly better than their fixed mindset group counterparts. In a second study, replicating the first, growth mindset group participants also reported lower levels of impostor feelings and less likelihood of dropping the course.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The third study looked at how students felt about their professors’ mindset beliefs in the real world. Participants who were enrolled in STEM courses at three US universities completed a survey reporting their perceptions of their professors’ mindset beliefs, and provided their personal mindset beliefs and SAT scores. They then completed surveys measuring engagement and psychological experiences as in the previous two studies. As expected, those who saw their professors as having fixed mindset beliefs had greater concerns about the course, greater feelings of being an impostor, and increased negative affect in classes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A final longitudinal study replicated these results, also finding that participants who felt their professor had fixed mindset beliefs were more likely to skip class than those who felt their professor had a growth mindset. There was also an indirect effect on actual performance in class: those who believed their professor had a fixed mindset felt less of a sense of belonging, which in turn predicted lower grades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mindset beliefs are clearly hugely important, both in terms of how people experience the classroom and their outcomes at the end of a course. But while changing student mindset beliefs may go some way to improving learning, it’s not enough — as the team suggests, the learning environment itself might need to change. Staff could be informed of the potential impact of their mindset beliefs, for instance, and be encouraged to help students adapt to particular courses or new skills.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other studies have also suggested that women and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/09/first-generation-university-students-are-at-greater-risk-of-experiencing-imposter-syndrome/&quot;&gt;first-generation university students are at greater risk of experiencing impostor syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, particularly within STEM courses. Building confidence and reducing impostor feelings and psychological vulnerability could therefore improve not only student outcomes but diversity in STEM fields more generally — a serious incentive for teaching staff to think about their mindsets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-30956-001&quot;&gt;Does my professor think my ability can change? Students’ perceptions of their STEM professors’ mindset beliefs predict their psychological vulnerability, engagement, and performance in class.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/Bloodstream-infection-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nephrologists deal with catheter malfunctions and non-functional catheters on a daily basis, usually related to thrombosis. Nephrologists want every patient on chronic hemodialysis to have a more permanent type of vascular access such as a fistula or graft, but for some patients, this is not suitable or they may require a catheter while a fistula or graft is developing. In the United States in 2018, more than four out of every five patients receiving hemodialysis were using a fistula or graft (82.4%; 65.7% fistula and 16.7% graft). Meaning about 17.6% were using a catheter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the time spent on trouble-shooting catheter malfunction or dealing with bloodstream infections, I’m always looking for new ways to prevent these complications related to catheters.  An &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02243-y&quot;&gt;article by Richtrova &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;, published last week in &lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt;, looked at whether rt-PA vs trisodium citrate would prevent catheter-related bloodstream infections, catheter malfunction, or catheter non-function. It was a small study with only 18 patients, with the authors originally planning to recruit 80 patients. However, the recruitment rates are not unexpected given the efforts to keep catheter use low and increase fistula and graft use. Even with the small numbers, there are some findings worth keeping in mind. There was no reduction in the incidence of catheter malfunction/non-function or catheter-related bloodstream infections, but the overall incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections was low in their population. Catheter patency (also known as being unobstructed) was more related to the time interval between sessions and if there were prior catheter malfunctions as opposed to the use of agents. The longer period without the use of a catheter will predispose catheter thrombosis leading to malfunction or non-function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no reduction in the incidence of catheter malfunction/non-function or catheter-related bloodstream infections, but the overall incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections was low&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other agents have been used to prevent thrombosis leading to catheter dysfunction. The most common anticoagulant locking solutions (meaning solutions used to fill catheters in between hemodialysis sessions to prevent clotting) are heparin and 4% citrate. In fact, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asdin.org/page/A2&quot;&gt;American Society of Diagnostic Interventional Nephrologists&lt;/a&gt; recommends that both heparin and 4% citrate are acceptable catheter locks. Thrombolytic agents like rt-PA have been looked at before. It has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://adc.bmj.com/content/92/6/499&quot;&gt;previously shown&lt;/a&gt; that rt-PA is significantly more effective than heparin in preventing clot formation in hemodialysis catheters. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1011376&quot;&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; previously compared rt-PA to heparin as a locking solution, concluding that there was a significantly reduced incidence of catheter malfunction and bacteremia. So why not switch to rt-PA as a locking solution for one out of three sessions per week? First, there is an issue of cost. Overall, nephrologists tend to use rt-PA as a treatment to fix the catheter when it stops working rather than as a prevention strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though there are significant efforts to have a more permanent vascular access such as a fistula or graft, there are individuals that can only dialyze via a catheter. Since dialysis vascular access is a lifeline for hemodialysis patients, we should continue to look at options for maintenance and optimization of catheter function. The complications related to catheters, especially infections, have an unfavorable effect on morbidity, mortality, and cost. In addition, infections are the second most frequent cause of death in dialysis patients. This is why I’m always on the lookout for ways to preserve my patient’s catheter function.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first of many planned for 2021, these workshops – co-hosted by the NIH BRAIN Initiative and Department of Energy (DOE) – will bring together &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;experts to discuss neural circuit mapping, connectomics, and challenges in whole-brain mapping. Please join us on Feb. 5 and 17, and March 5, 17, and 31&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-3012&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NIH BRAIN Initiative recently partnered with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.energy.gov/science/office-science&quot;&gt;Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science&lt;/a&gt; to organize five workshops on brain connectivity. Following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/strategic-planning/acd-working-groups/brain-initiative%C2%AE-20-cells-circuits-toward-cures&quot;&gt;findings of the BRAIN 2.0 reports&lt;/a&gt;, this series will bring together researchers with broad expertise to discuss state-of-the-art technologies in mapping complete neural circuits, opportunities to advance connectomics, and challenges to creating detailed maps of brain connectivity – “wiring diagrams” spanning the entire mammalian brain. Ultimately, together with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/brain-programs/cell-census-network-biccn&quot;&gt;BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network&lt;/a&gt; cell-type “parts list”, these diagrams will advance our understanding of brain circuitry and function, and drive innovations in data science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workshops are open to anyone and will be livestreamed on NIH Videocast. You can view the them live at &lt;a href=&quot;https://videocast.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;https://videocast.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt; on the day of the event. Each workshop will take place from 11:00 AM – 4:00 PM (EST).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This workshop will explore the potential impact of generating detailed maps of brain connectivity spanning the entire mammalian brain. Invited speakers will discuss the value of mapping connectomes across species (e.g., drosophila, zebrafish, songbirds), retina connectomics, and how rodent connectomes inform our understanding of learning and behavior. There will also be a panel discussion on the importance of the whole mouse brain connectome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mozart famously started playing the piano and composing while still a young child. But if he hadn’t started musical practice then, would his future achievements have been as impressive? Is there, in other words, a “sensitive period” in which the brain is especially susceptible to musical stimulation, and during which a person must start to acquire musical skills in order to achieve their full potential — as is the case for visual perception, say, or language acquisition? There has been a lot of debate about this, but now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620959014&quot;&gt;major new study&lt;/a&gt; of professional musicians and identical and non-identical twins in Sweden suggests not. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41275&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 310 musicians studied by Laura Wesseldijk at the Karolinska Institute and colleagues were all either professionally active or students at a music college. They were aged between 27 and 54 (to match the age range of the twin sample) and had started musical training between the ages of two and 18. These participants reported on when they started that training and how many hours a week they had spent in music practice up to the age of 18, as well as in adulthood. Their musical aptitude was measured using an online test of ability to discriminate pitch, melody and rhythm. They also reported on their level of musical achievement, giving details of how many works they had composed and had performed, any radio or TV recordings, and any music awards, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The twin data came from the Swedish Twin Registry. Some 7,786 twins reported having played music at some point in their lives, and of these, 4,814 had taken the same musical discrimination test, and 4,887 had provided information on their musical achievement (giving details of any compositions and amateur performances, or awards, for instance).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team did indeed find that for both the professionals and twins, those who’d started their musical training before the age of 8 went on to develop greater musical aptitude &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; higher levels of achievement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, when the researchers took total lifetime hours of practice into account, only the link with musical aptitude remained — and it became limited. Starting training at a younger age was associated with better pitch — but not rhythm — discrimination. (This tallies with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5895917/&quot;&gt;some recent work&lt;/a&gt; finding that children who received musical training before the age of 7 did better on melody, but not rhythm, tests than children who’d started their training later.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And when the researchers looked more closely at the twin data (by considering, for example, pairs of identical twins who had started musical training at different ages, and data for identical vs nonidentical twins), they found that the association between starting training earlier and doing better later could be fully explained by shared genetic and environmental factors . That is, there was no need to invoke a “sensitive period” to explain why kids who start musical training in early childhood tend to do better later, but instead musicians (professional or amateur) who start tuition earlier and do better on the tests later may have benefitted from inheriting “musical” genes from their parents &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; from growing up in a musical environment at home. Their parents may have been better able to spot and foster musical talent in the children, and organised tuition for these children at a younger age, which made for more lifetime practice hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, the new results “provide little direct support that early training has a specific, causal effect on later performance and achievement,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are other fields — notably sport — in which it’s also been suggested that there’s a sensitive period for training in childhood, to maximise later performance. However, findings in this area have been mixed, too. Some studies that have found a benefit to starting early have failed to take into account total lifetime hours of practice, the researchers point out. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27923322/&quot;&gt;One 2017 study of athletes&lt;/a&gt; even found that those who’d won medals had specialised in their main sport significantly later than non-medallists (though they had been involved in other sports for longer).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the field of music, starting early is clearly associated with better later performance. But if you’re worrying that perhaps you’ve missed a critical window of greater brain responsiveness for your own child to start musical training, the lesson from the new work seems to be: don’t.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620959014&quot;&gt;Why Is an Early Start of Training Related to Musical Skills in Adulthood? A Genetically Informative Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creating a 3D atlas of nerve innervation in the pancreas…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instinct and experience drive the cortical plasticity needed for maternal behavior…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new central amygdala fear circuit…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shedding light on visual discrimination circuits in primates….&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-2988&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists create a whole-organ 3D atlas of pancreatic nerve fibers in diabetes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islets are groups of cells in the pancreas that are important for glucose metabolism. Pancreatic islets contain several types of cells, including insulin-producing β cells. Previous studies have shown that islet cells receive dense input from nerve fibers and that this innervation controls blood glucose; thus, elucidating the detailed anatomy of the pancreas in diabetes may provide new insights into metabolic disease. The pancreas, however, is highly heterogeneous and our understanding of its anatomy and function remains incomplete. Here, &lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/stanleylab/meet-the-team/&quot;&gt;Dr. Sarah Stanley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;external link&quot; class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540&quot; style=&quot;height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;&quot; title=&quot;This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and her research team at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33036983/&quot;&gt;used tissue clearing and whole-organ imaging to create a high-resolution 3D atlas of pancreatic nerve fibers and identified a new mechanism of neural input remodeling in diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, researchers used the tissue clearing technique iDISCO&lt;sup&gt;+ &lt;/sup&gt;and 3D volume imaging and analysis to determine the distribution of β cells, glucagon-producing α cells, and neurofilament 200 kDa (NF200)-positive input fibers in the pancreata of healthy and diabetic mice. NF200 is a neuronal marker that is thought to reflect neural remodeling. They also examined islet and nerve structure in pancreatic tissue from five healthy and three diabetic human donors. Dr. Stanley and her colleagues found that the innervation of the endocrine pancreas was enriched in healthy mice, and innervated islets were larger than non-innervated islets in healthy mice and humans. Islet nerve density and NF200 were increased in the islets of two mouse models of diabetes. Also, nerve density and the proportion of innervated islets was increased in pancreatic tissue from diabetic humans compared to healthy subjects. Researchers also suspected that nerve innervation may change during the development of diabetes. To address this, they used streptozotocin (STZ), a drug that is toxic to β cells, in mice to induce diabetes and found that islet nerve density increased over time compared to control mice. Overall, these findings show that nerve input into islets is maintained in diabetic humans and may be remodeled during disease development. This work constitutes a “3D atlas of pancreatic nerve innervation”, serving as a tool for researchers to quantify β cell mass, define islets, map pancreatic innervation, and assess the interaction between islets and innervation across species. Altogether, this work may help further our understanding of diabetes and lead to novel treatment targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maternal responses to the cries of pups are driven by both innate and plastic mechanisms &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brains of mammals seem to be hardwired to respond to the cries of our infants. However, a virgin mouse will not respond to the cries of another’s pups until she is co-housed with a dam and her litter. This suggests that there may be a re-wiring of the auditory cortex during this experience that enables pup retrieval behavior. But what enables this tuning of the brain to the cries of pups? Here, the lab of &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/robert-c-froemke&quot;&gt;Dr. Robert Froemke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;external link&quot; class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540&quot; style=&quot;height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;&quot; title=&quot;This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and his team at New York University recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33029014/&quot;&gt;demonstrated that after co-housing with pups, cortical plasticity and the oxytocin system rapidly re-tuned neurons in the auditory cortex of virgin mice.&lt;/a&gt; The virgin mice also learned to recognize pup cries and retrieve pups. Thus, neural mechanisms triggered by pup experience build upon hard-wired instincts, and drive parenting behavior. In the study, researchers co-housed virgin female mice with a dam and her litter, and then assessed cortical re-tuning. First, they determined the inter-syllable intervals at which females responded to pups and established a library of both prototypical pup calls and morphed calls for later playback procedures. Then, using two-photon imaging and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; voltage-clamp recordings, they found that excitatory and inhibitory tuning and synaptic responses were altered by maternal experience. Next, they expressed the calcium indicator GCaMP6f in either excitatory or inhibitory neurons in the auditory cortex of virgins and monitored temporal tuning throughout co-housing. This revealed that co-housing results in the coordinated plasticity of neuronal tuning. Finally, the researchers optogenetically inhibited hypothalamic oxytocin neurons of virgin females, co-housed those females with a dam and her litter, during the playback of various pup calls. They found that the oxytocin system is required for the re-tuning of cortical neurons. Altogether, these data demonstrate the importance of central oxytocin in synaptic plasticity processes within the auditory cortex for maternal behavior. Further, this study illustrates how the cortex tunes to the vocalizations of pups. While both experience and innate mechanisms are necessary for the development of maternal behavior, these data provide new insight into how the brain learns maternal skills.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identification of a new fear circuit from the central amygdala to the globus pallidus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it has long been known that the amygdala is central to fear and emotional learning, the exact organization and function of its long-range outputs remain elusive. The central amygdala (CeA) is classically thought of as the output zone of the amygdala complex, but how do CeA projections modulate fear learning? Recently, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bolilab.labsites.cshl.edu/&quot;&gt;Dr. Bo Li&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;external link&quot; class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540&quot; style=&quot;height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;&quot; title=&quot;This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and his team from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) and Stanford University sought to answer this question. In their new paper, the researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33067362/&quot;&gt;showed that the CeA projects to the globus pallidus (GPe) in order to relay information about a stimulus to regulate fear learning&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, they found that a subpopulation of CeA-GPe projections conveys information about the unconditioned stimulus (US) during auditory fear conditioning. During fear conditioning, the US is the electrical foot shock, whereas the stimulus that elicits a fear response (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;, freezing behavior) after it is paired with the US (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;, a tone) is called the conditioned stimulus. Researchers were interested in the inhibitory somatostatin positive (Sst+) neurons within the CeA and whether their circuitry helps regulate fear learning. To investigate this, Dr. Li’s team used a combination of state-of-the-art neuroscience techniques such as anatomical tract tracing, optogenetic modulation, fiber photometry, &lt;em&gt;in vitro &lt;/em&gt;electrophysiology, and fluorescent &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; hybridization in male and female mice. First, using retrograde cholera toxin B tracers, they confirmed that the CeA sends a subpopulation of neuronal projections to the GPe. Using sophisticated labeling procedures, they next showed that the vast majority of GPe-projecting CeA neurons express Sst.  Anterograde tracing also demonstrated that projections from the CeA to the GPe originate predominantly from Sst+ neurons. Using a tetanus toxin light chain (TeLC) viral method, they also showed that blocking neurotransmission within CeA-GPe projections abolished conditioned freezing, indicating that these projections are necessary for fear learning. Fiber photometry revealed that these projections are specifically relaying information about the US during auditory fear conditioning. Further, optogenetically inhibiting or activating GPe-projecting CeA neurons during US presentation blocked or promoted fear learning, respectively, demonstrating that these projections are essential for fear memory formation. Altogether, this team showed that a new CeA-GPe projection is critical for fear memory regulation. These data are critical for characterizing the circuits controlling fear learning-related behaviors, which is an important step toward the development of circuit-based therapeutics following aversive experiences.

Retrograde tracing with cholera toxin B (CTB; red) combined with fluorescent in situ labeling procedures show that most CeA-to-GPe neurons (93 ± 3%) express somatostatin (Sst; green) and not PKC-delta (Prkcd; white). A nuclear counterstain (DAPI; blue) was also used to visualize cell bodies.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The macaque ventrolateral prefrontal cortex boosts inferior temporal cortex population coding to allow rapid object recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the prefrontal cortex has long been known for its role in cognition and emotional processing, it is also critical for visual perception. There is also an emerging role for the inferior temporal cortex (IT) in object discrimination. But how do these two regions interact to enable the recognition of objects? Studying the computational functions within cortical circuits is critical in developing the next generation of models of visual intelligence, which will enable us to understand fundamental behaviors such as object recognition and discrimination. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dicarlolab.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;Dr. James DiCarlo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;external link&quot; class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540&quot; style=&quot;height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;&quot; title=&quot;This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website.

Their new study &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33080226/&quot;&gt;illustrates the role of connections between the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and the primate ventral visual cortex in robust core visual object recognition&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, they were interested in testing whether the vlPFC is an important node in the visual object processing network by pharmacologically inactivating this region and simultaneously recording IT activity with Utah electrode arrays in macaques. They found that reversible, pharmacological inactivation of the vlPFC with muscimol reduced the quality of the IT population code and resulted in deteriorations in object discrimination performance. During the visual discrimination task, this effect of silencing the vlPFC was significantly higher for the late-solved images than for the early-solved images. They also found that inactivation of the vlPFC reduced IT late-phase neuronal population activity. These results suggest that vlPFC is part of a recurrent neural circuit that boosts the performance of the ventral visual processing stream, as opposed to shallow feedforward systems. Studies such as this will one day help to elucidate a complete, mechanistic understanding of visual object recognition, from images to behavior, at the level of the neuron.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swearing, drinking, or making social transgressions are not behaviours we generally think of as good. &lt;/strong&gt;But in some cases, these kinds of “bad” behaviours can have benefits, both for ourselves and others. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/five-ways-bad-behaviour-can-benefit-you-and-others-154004&quot;&gt;Richard Stephens explains why&lt;/a&gt; at&lt;em&gt; The Conversation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people have argued that public health messages should use shocking images of illness and death to drive home the importance of staying home and socially distancing. &lt;/strong&gt;But there’s reason to doubt the effectiveness of disturbing photos in convincing people of the dangers of the pandemic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-shocking-images-persuade-doubters-of-covids-dangers/&quot;&gt;write Nathan Ballantyne, Jared Celniker and Peter Ditto&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;. Their study showed that such images did little to change people’s opinion about the virus, even though participants believed they would.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a recent study, older adults who took afternoon naps showed superior performance on certain tests of language and memory&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/afternoon-naps-linked-to-improved-cognitive-function/&quot;&gt;reports Frankie Macpherson&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus&lt;/em&gt;. But there are plenty of caveats, not least that the correlational data means that no firm conclusions can be made about the direction of the relationship between taking naps and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another study has highlighted the toll of the coronavirus pandemic on mental health. &lt;/strong&gt;The vast majority of students surveyed at seven American universities last spring reported moderate or high levels of emotional distress, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-us-college-students-mental-health&quot;&gt;reports Sujata Gupta&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;. The psychological impact was particularly prominent among certain groups, including women, Asian participants, and those on lower incomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s common for women to experience worries and anxieties during pregnancy, and some pregnant women may end up meeting the criteria for a full-blown anxiety disorder. &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;Psyche&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-manage-your-worries-and-fears-during-pregnancy&quot;&gt;Pamela Wiegartz has written a guide&lt;/a&gt; with strategies for managing feelings of anxiety during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;

An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S009286742031254X&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exhaustive catalog&lt;/a&gt; of cell types comprising a specific class of inhibitory neurons within mouse visual cortex. What do these massive research programs have in common? Both efforts were conducted by large multidisciplinary teams at non-traditional research institutions: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/bluebrain/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Blue Brain Project&lt;/a&gt; based in Lausanne, Switzerland and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Allen Institute for Brain Science&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BIG SCIENCE is the wave of the future, and the future is now.&lt;/b&gt; Actually, that future started 15-20 years ago. The question should be, is there a future for any other kind of neuroscience? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite a superficial “BIG SCIENCE” similarity, the differences between funding sources, business models, leadership, operation, and goals of Blue Brain and the Allen Institute are substantial. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Markram&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Henry Markram&lt;/a&gt;, the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/human-brain-project-votes-for-leadership-change-1.17060&quot;&gt;charismatic but divisive&lt;/a&gt;” visionary behind Blue Brain (and the €1 billion Human Brain Project) has been criticized for his “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/human-brain-project-votes-for-leadership-change-1.17060&quot;&gt;autocratic&lt;/a&gt;” leadership, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/computer-modelling-brain-in-a-box-1.10066&quot;&gt;crap&lt;/a&gt;” ideas, and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/computer-modelling-brain-in-a-box-1.10066&quot;&gt;ill-conceived&lt;/a&gt;, ... idiosyncratic approach to brain simulation” in countless articles. His &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/computer-modelling-brain-in-a-box-1.10066&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ambition&lt;/a&gt; is undeniable, however:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“I realized I could be doing this [&lt;i&gt;eg., standard research on &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/275/5297/213&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spike-timing-dependent plasticity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;] for the next 25, 30 years of my  career, and it was still not going to help me understand &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;how the brain  works&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm certainly not a brilliant neuroscientist in Markram's league, but I commented  previously on &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2020/12/how-brain-works.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;how a quest&lt;/a&gt; to discover &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;“how  the brain works”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; might be futile:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;...the search for  the Holy Grail of [&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/a-neural-data-science-how-and-why-d7e3969086f2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The Spike&quot;&gt;spike trains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2017.0623&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Generative models for network neuroscience&quot;&gt;network generative models&lt;/a&gt;, manipulated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438820301471&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;according to NIH BRAIN&quot;&gt;neural circuit function&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_seung_i_am_my_connectome&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;'I Am My Connectome'- Sebastian Seung's TED talk&quot;&gt;My Own Private Connectome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nn0199_79&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;classic Rao &amp;amp; Ballard (1999)&quot;&gt;predictive coding&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aliusresearch.org/uploads/9/1/6/0/91600416/friston_-_of_woodlice_and_men.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Friston of course&quot;&gt;free energy principle&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), or a computer simulation of the human brain  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/henry_markram_a_brain_in_a_supercomputer?language=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Henry Markram's TED talk&quot;&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; by the Blue Brain Project] that will “explain” how “The Brain” works is  a quixotic quest. It's a misguided effort when the goal is framed so  simplistically (or monolithically).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In his infamous 2009 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/henry_markram_a_brain_in_a_supercomputer?language=en&quot;&gt;TED talk&lt;/a&gt;, Markram stated that a computer simulation of the human brain was possible in 10 years:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“I hope that you are at least partly convinced that it is not impossible to build a brain. We can do it within 10 years, and if we do succeed, we will send to TED, in 10 years, a hologram to talk to you.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This claim would come back to haunt him in 2019, because (of course) he was nowhere close to simulating a human brain. In his defense, Markram said that his critics &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6057/748&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;misunderstood&lt;/a&gt; and misinterpreted his grandiose proclamations.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800180;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blue Brain is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/bluebrain/&quot;&gt;aimed at&lt;/a&gt; “biologically detailed digital reconstructions and simulations of the mouse brain.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Silico&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documentary filmmaker &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noahhutton.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Noah Hutton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800180;&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;undertook his own 10 year project that followed Markram and colleagues as they worked towards the goals of Blue Brain. He was motivated by &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;that&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; TED talk and its enthralling prediction of a brain in a supercomputer (hence &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;). Originally entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bluebrain-documentary-premiere/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bluebrain&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and focused on Markram, the documentary evolved over time to include more realistic viewpoints and interviews with skeptical scientists, including Anne Churchland, Terry Sejnowski, Stanislas Dehaene, and Cori Bargmann. Ironically, Sebastian Seung was one of the loudest critics (ironic because Seung has a grandiose TED talk of his own, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_seung_i_am_my_connectome&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I Am My Connectome&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insilicofilm.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In Silico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; was available for streaming during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docnyc.net/film/in-silico/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DOC NYC&lt;/a&gt; Festival in November (in the US only), and I had the opportunity to watch it. I was impressed by the motivation and dedication required to complete such a lengthy project.  Hutton had gathered so much footage that he could have made multiple movies from different perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the film, Blue Brain/Human Brain blew up, with ample critiques and a signed petition from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/07/updated-european-neuroscientists-revolt-against-eus-human-brain-project&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hundreds&lt;/a&gt; of neuroscientists (see archived &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20140710070144/http://www.neurofuture.eu:80/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open Letter&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And  Hutton grew up. He reflects on the process (and how he changed) at the end of film. He was only 22 at the start, and 10 years is a long time at any age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the Big Questions in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insilicofilm.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In Silico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you make sure all this lovely simulated activity would be relevant for an animal's behavior?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you build in biological imperfections (noise) or introduce chaos into your perfect pristine computational model? “Tiny mistakes” are critical for adaptable biological systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;“You cannot play the same soccer game again,” said one of the critics (Terry Sejnowski, I think)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;“What is a generic brain?”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the vision? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timeline kept drifting further and further into the future. It was 10 years in 2009, 10 years in 2012, 10 years in 2013, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geneva 2019, and it's Year 10 &lt;span class=&quot;aCOpRe&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; only two Principals left, 150 papers published, and a model of 10 million neurons in mouse cortex. Stunning visuals, but still disconnected from behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, “What have we learned about the brain? Not much. The model is incomprehensible,” to paraphrase Sejnowski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;GABA Interneurons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another brilliant and charismatic neuroscientist, &lt;a href=&quot;https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/about/team/staff-profiles/christof-koch/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Christof Koch&lt;/a&gt;, was interviewed by Hutton. “Henry has two personalities. One is a  fantastic, sober scientist … the other is a PR-minded messiah.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koch is Chief Scientist of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/news-press/press-releases/allen-institute-announces-new-phase-neuroscience-research&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MindScope Program&lt;/a&gt; at the  Allen Institute for Brain Science, which focuses on how neural circuits produce vision. Another major unit is the Cell Types Program, which (as advertised) focuses on brain cell types and connectivity.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800180;&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Allen Institute &lt;a href=&quot;https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;core principles&lt;/a&gt; are team science, Big Science, and open science. An impressive recent paper by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S009286742031254X&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gouwens and 97 colleagues (2020&lt;/a&gt;) is a prime example of all three. Meticulous analyses of structural, physiological, and genetic properties identified 28 “met-types” of GABAergic interneurons that have congruent &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;m&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;orphological, &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;lectrophysiological, and &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;t&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;ranscriptomic properties. This was winnowed down from more than 500 morphologies in 4,200 GABA-containing interneurons in mouse visual cortex. With this mind-boggling level of neuronal complexity in one specific class of cells in mouse cortex — along with the impossibility of “mind uploading” — my inclination is to say that we will &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;never&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqlvSDEhxoA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Romeo Void&quot;&gt;never say never&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; be able to build a realistic computer simulation of the human brain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JHd5XsNXIHg/YBPngNhheaI/AAAAAAAANQg/FvRwoMugSzMJWfbd1gAHj2XWR8nq4W34ACLcBGAsYHQ/s996/multi-modal%2Bdata%2Bcollection%2Bfrom%2BGABAergic%2Binterneurons.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;996&quot; data-original-width=&quot;996&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JHd5XsNXIHg/YBPngNhheaI/AAAAAAAANQg/FvRwoMugSzMJWfbd1gAHj2XWR8nq4W34ACLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h400/multi-modal%2Bdata%2Bcollection%2Bfrom%2BGABAergic%2Binterneurons.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S009286742031254X&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gouwens et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800180;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Here's another gem: “There literally are only a handful of equations that you need to simulate the activity of the neocortex.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800180;&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Most of Hutton's work has been as writer and director of documentary  films, but I was excited to see that his first narrative feature, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lapsisfilm.com/&quot;&gt;Lapsis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,  will be available for streaming next month. To accompany his film, he's  created an immersive online world of interlinked websites that  advertise non-existent employment opportunities, entertainment ventures,  diseases, and treatments. It very much reminds me of the realistic yet  spoof websites associated with the films &lt;i&gt;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20050205164041/http://www.lacunainc.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LACUNA, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Ex Machina&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20160305001055/http://bluebook.is/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BlueBook&lt;/a&gt;).

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the start of a new year it’s customary to look forward, imagining what we might want to achieve in the months to come. It’s what lies at the heart of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/13/how-to-achieve-your-new-years-resolutions-according-to-psychology/&quot;&gt;New Year’s resolutions&lt;/a&gt;: they may be maligned for their persistent failure to stick, but do at least represent a great degree of hope for the future — a hope to become fitter or more productive, or to learn something new. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the current circumstances hope is certainly in short supply. But if you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; manage to stay hopeful you might be able to avoid risk-taking behaviours like drinking, taking drugs, gambling or overeating, argues a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-020-09989-4&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Gambling Studies&lt;/em&gt; from Shahriar Keshavarz and team at the University of East Anglia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study focuses specifically on “relative deprivation” — the belief that your lot in life is somehow worse than other people’s. Previous research has suggested that those who score highly on feelings of relative deprivation are more likely to engage in “maladaptive escape behaviours” including risk-taking. But hope could ameliorate such behaviour, the team argues, protecting people from potential harm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41249&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 51 participants started by filling in two measures. One looked at hope, with participants indicating how much they agreed with statements related to goal-directed energy (“I energetically pursue my goals”) and alternate routes to success (“I can think of many ways to get out of a jam”). The second looked at relative deprivation — how deprived or privileged participants felt compared to other people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, the participants took part in a risk-taking task. They saw an animated cannon, which could fire balls that land anywhere between 0 and 100 metres away, and were asked to bet on where they thought the ball would land. When selecting the distance, participants had three options: a high risk option, which let them cover a five metre range (e.g. the ball landing between 20 and 25 metres away), a medium risk option, which offered a ten metre range (e.g. 20 and 30 metres) and a low risk option (e.g. 20 to 40 metres). The higher the risk, the more money participants could win.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants who felt relatively deprived showed an inverse relationship between goal-directed energy and risk-taking. That is, among this group risk-taking was lower for those who had a greater sense of “hope” in the form of directing energy towards achieving their goals. (Those who felt relatively privileged showed the opposite pattern, with risk taking increasing among those with greater hope).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the second study, 50 participants again filled in measures related to hope and relative deprivation, before being shown their position on a (fake) “Comparative Discretionary Income” index, showing how deprived or privileged they were compared to others based on their income. Some participants were shown a score that indicated they were deprived, while others were told they were comparatively privileged. They then completed the risk-taking measure from the first experiment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that inducing people to feel deprived led them to take more risks — but again, those who reported more feelings of hope regarding their goals took less risks than those with low levels of hope.  This suggests hope for the future may act as a protective factor against risk-taking in those who feel relatively deprived. Relatively privileged participants again showed the opposite pattern, with hope increasing risk taking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The final study looked at 122 participants who had gambled at least once in the last year. Participants completed the hope and relative deprivation scales, as well as an index measuring how severe their gambling was on a scale from one (no problem) to four (problem gambling). Results from this measure suggested that 27% of participants had no gambling problems, 26% had low levels of problems, 38% had moderate problems and 9% were problem gamblers with possible loss of control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As in the previous studies, among participants who reported being relatively deprived, those who showed more goal-directed energy were less likely to have problems with gambling. There was no relationship between hope and gambling severity amongst those who felt relatively privileged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hope may therefore be a vital tool for those experiencing difficulties in their life, buffering against risky or potentially harmful behaviours like gambling, drinking or drug-taking. The team posits that those who feel relatively deprived engage in risky behaviours in order to allay or sublimate negative feeling; understanding the importance of hope in such a situation may be a good start in developing behavioural interventions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It can be difficult to feel satisfied with what you’ve got, especially if those around you appear to be thriving financially, socially or romantically. Looking for ways out of your situation, energetically pursuing goals and thinking of new solutions to problems may not solve all of your problems — but it could make the temptations of risk-taking easier to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-020-09989-4&quot;&gt;Relative Deprivation and Hope: Predictors of Risk Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="fr-FR">
 &lt;p&gt;What is science? It is somewhat frustrating for a scientist to not be able to answer this question precisely. Yet it is a very important question, in particular in the public debate. For example, how are we to convince people to listen to science if we cannot explain what is special about science? What makes science better than the opinion of any given person or institution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this has been a central question in philosophy of science. For a while, it was thought that science is characterized by a particular method, a set of rules that one can follow to produce new truths about the world. This is impossible, because for any finite set of observations, there is an infinite number of general propositions that agree with those observations. Then came Karl Popper: he proposed that a scientific proposition is a proposition that can in principle be falsified, that is, such that there exists a statement that would logically contradict it (whether it is actually true or not). For example, “all penguins are black” can be contradicted by the statement “this is a blue penguin”. Popper’s motivation was to distinguish between science and pseudo-science or religious discourse. For example, it is not possible to contradict the existence of God because any fact can be interpreted as what God wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although still very popular today, in particular among biologists, falsifiability has been heavily criticized. There are several fatal shortcomings in this idea. A simple one is that it tends to classify pseudo-sciences as sciences, for a simple reason: they can be falsified because they actually have been falsified. So the criterion is not sufficient. Other arguments show that it is not necessary (or meaningful) either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other analyses have shown that methods used by scientists are rather flexible both historically and, more importantly, across disciplines. Physicists do not use double-blind tests with control groups. Paleontologists do not produce empirical knowledge by experimentation. So if there is a scientific method, then which one is it? It is not that there is no scientific method. Rather, scientific methods are objects of scientific activity (things that scientists develop, use and discuss) rather than definitions of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Hoyningen-Huene proposes a new theory of the nature of science, called systematicity theory, which brings some interesting ideas to this question. It is published in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199985050.001.0001/acprof-9780199985050&quot;&gt;recent book&lt;/a&gt;, and formerly &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11406-007-9100-x&quot;&gt;in a short article&lt;/a&gt;. First, the original angle is that instead of comparing science with pseudo-science, he compares science with everyday knowledge. With this perspective, it becomes clear that there is something special about not just natural sciences, but essentially all academic fields including human sciences. History, for example, is distinctly more scientific than anecdotes that you could tell at dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thesis is that what characterizes science is that is more &lt;em&gt;systematic&lt;/em&gt; than non-science (on a similar subject). This idea of systematicity is developed in several dimensions. It must be noted that his goal is descriptive, nor normative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, scientific descriptions tend to be systematic, e.g. with taxonomy, axiomatization, periodization (for history). Take the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6118/452&quot;&gt;discovery of actin rings in the axon&lt;/a&gt; of neurons thanks to super-resolution microscopy. This is purely descriptive. Is it not science because it is not a test of a theory, maybe on the epistemic level of a news article? No, it is clearly science: it is part of an effort to systematically describe what a cell is made of. Writing the state of the art in a thesis, for example, is an exercise to systematically cover everything relevant about a particular subject, and it is an important skill that a scientist must acquire. Not crediting and referencing a relevant study is considered a professional error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A particularly important dimension of systematicity is the defense of knowledge claims, that is, the way scientific claims are backed up. In mathematics, for example, there is the formal proof, a systematic way of demonstrating the validity of a claim. In other sciences, one may try to systematically consider and rule out alternative interpretations. All sciences develop field-specific methods to avoid errors. It is not that there is a method that is guaranteed to produce truths. Rather, there is an effort in each discipline to systematically develop ways of tracking errors. This includes social practices, such as peer review. In peer review, the author must systematically address all contradictions raised by a reviewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book addresses many other aspects. It is not a particularly entertaining book, in fact I suspect that the author has made a particular effort to be systematic in his treatment of the subject. But the thesis is interesting because it covers many distinctive aspects of science that are usually not reported when discussing the nature of science. It also gives a more satisfying account of how science differs from pseudo-science. Pseudo-science is typically selective rather than systematic: claims are supported by a careful selection of evidence; objections are dismissed rather than systematically rebutted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the thesis is not meant to be normative, I think it provides an interesting perspective on several aspects of modern science that are currently discussed, and which are also relevant to the politics of science. I will briefly discuss two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is the spread of scientific story-telling. In so-called “high-profile” journals, in particular in biology, there is considerable pressure to present a “good story”, something that is coherent, appealing, entertaining. And as publishing in those journals basically determines whether you can remain a working scientist, this is considerable pressure on all scientists. A scientist must also be a good communicator, story-telling advocates say. Obviously, it is better to have a well-written paper than a poorly written paper. Yes, but everything else being equal. Here unfortunately making a good story means selecting and ordering results so as to construct a coherent narrative, while dismissing every observation, remark, or previous study, which weakens or confuses the narrative. This clearly goes against systematicity. What then distinguishes such scientific “stories” from pseudo-scientific claims misleadingly backed up by carefully selected facts? It seems clear that systematically acknowledging all facts and interpretations that are not in line with the thesis of the authors, or simply that require specific explanations, is critically important in a scientific study. Yes, it might make the paper less entertaining and exciting. But that should not be the primary goal: the primary goal a scientific paper is a systematic report on a study. Developing scientific writing skills does not necessarily mean making up stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another and related aspect is the idea, in particular in the research funding system, that good science must be disruptive, paradigm-shifting - only innovative ideas must be funded. Yes, because it is better to do ground-breaking science than ground-scratching science. This is the key principle of the ERC, for example. But again, this is not what science is about. This might be what product development is about (not even sure about that). But science is about systematically consolidating, expanding and connecting existing pieces of knowledge. Occasionally extraordinary discoveries are made, or new fields emerge. But that is nowhere near the core of science, which relies on systematic, rigorous examination. Without this, what we are left with is a bunch of TED talks - entertaining, occasionally informing, but you cannot learn to build rockets by watching TED talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not think that systematicity theory exhausts the question, however. What seems missing, in particular, is that science is about telling truths about the world. Science is a systematic activity, but not any activity: it is an activity whose goal is to document truths about the world. This means that being a scientist is not just following some practices, but also making an ethical commitment: a commitment to an ideal of truth. This is in my view a critical point when discussing the politics of science - how science should be organized, evaluated, communicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it certainly does not exhaust the subject, what is satisfying about Hoyningen-Huene’s book is that, while it is lucid enough to acknowledge that there is no universal scientific method, it still convincingly argues that there is something special about science, something that may be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/disease-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementation Science is a growing field that seeks to accelerate the science into real world practice, an event that can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3241518/&quot;&gt;often times take 17 years to achieve.&lt;/a&gt; While we are exploring the factors that affect the translation of science, we also need to understand why ineffective practices continue to persist and why effective practices are ended. This is what the study of mis-implementation seeks to answer. In particular, in the United States, it is estimated that only &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18287919/&quot;&gt;60% of public health practices are actually evidence based&lt;/a&gt;. That leaves the question about what is happening with the other 40% of practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our research published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, our team conducted a national survey of state health department chronic disease employees to gather more information on how often they felt mis-implementation was occurring in their departments and what could be the possible factors that affect these types of decisions. As the United States has witnessed in the past year, State Health departments are significant drivers of public health interventions. Chronic Diseases are considered a considerable risk factor for cancer and it is estimated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/fundingprofiles/&quot;&gt;$1.1 billion is annually expended to state cancer control and chronic disease prevention programs&lt;/a&gt;. But despite this large number, a small amount of that is actually used towards primary prevention programs such as physical activity and nutritional intervention programs. Given the scarce resources available, it is crucial to know that every dollar is being used towards the most effective and wide-reaching programs. And unfortunately, that may not always be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;50.7% of state health department chronic disease employees reported that their work unit sometimes, often or always ended effective programs that should have continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our national survey, we found that 50.7% of state health department chronic disease employees reported that their work unit sometimes, often or always ended effective programs that should have continued. Not surprisingly, the overwhelming reason being funding priorities changed or ended. State Health Department funding is based heavily on time limited grants and it’s not always guaranteed that a successful program will continue to see its funding continue. This is consistent with the literature around evidence-based decision making that &lt;a href=&quot;https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13012-018-0717-x&quot;&gt;engaging with policymakers around programming funding can enhance the sustainment of evidence based programs.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side of the mis-implementation coin, 48.5% of state health department employees stated that sometimes, often or always continued programs that should have ended. While funding was still a prominent factor with inappropriately continued programs, policymakers and agency leadership were also significant factors in this decision making outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leadership qualities around perseverance of program implementation and managing change can also have an effect on program continuation outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked further about factors that affect these outcomes, participants revealed that organizational &amp;amp; agency factors have a significant influence. Most significant is that too many organizational layers in a state health agency can impede decision-making. Also leadership qualities around perseverance of program implementation and managing change can also have an effect on program continuation outcomes. Organizational capacity can be a major influence in the success of a programs outcomes. It is simply not enough to have an effective public health program. We also need public health agencies that have the organizational capacity to deliver them effectively and understand when programs should not be continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study team is continuing to build on this initial data by conducting qualitative case studies to highlight the mis-implementation challenges and success that state agencies have been met with in implementing these programs. The team has also partnered with a group at the Brookings Institute to create agent-based models that can help further describe and highlight how these decision-making processes play out in state agencies. These models can eventually be a tool for facilitating better decision-making in the eventual hope that it helps decrease the prevalence of mis-implementation in state health department chronic disease programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still much to learn about mis-implementation and how implementation science can improve our public health systems. Our study is one of the firsts to really identify these factors across state public health agencies in the United States. We hope that lessons learned from this study can eventually contributed to improved chronic disease health outcomes locally, nationally and globally.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Two boats are sinking and you can save only one. One holds two dogs, the other a person. Which do you save? If you’re not sure, you can say, ‘I can’t decide.’” When I put this to my 11-year-old, his response was immediate: “Save the dogs!” In his defence, he has grown up with a pet dog, which he adores — and, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620960398&quot;&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, most other kids would say the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To adults, these findings might seem a little alarming. Indeed, when the team put similar questions (varying the numbers of dogs, pigs and people) to adult participants, 61% opted to save one human over 100 dogs (which does mean of course that nearly 40% didn’t), and 85% of people prioritised one human over one dog, while 93% opted to save a human rather than a single pig (3% went for the pig).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the team asked 249 kids aged between five and nine about what they thought, though, they found that just over 70% opted to let a person die to save 100 dogs. When it came to one human vs one dog, only about a third of the children opted to save the person, 28% were clear on going for the dog, and the rest couldn’t decide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41239&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When pigs, rather than dogs, were pitted against people, the children’s responses were also revealing. Of course, pigs are not generally kept as pets, but for many of these urban, US-based kids (whose religion, if any, was not ascertained), are rather sources of food. And yet only 57% prioritised one human over one pig, and 18% reported that they’d save the pig. The child’s age had no impact — the 9-year-olds made the same judgements as the 5-year-olds. However, both kids and adults who had regular exposure to dogs showed less of bias in favour of people over dogs; for the kids, this also extended to a lower bias in favour of people over pigs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up study of fresh groups of adult and child participants, the team kept the same varying human vs dog or pig ratios but altered the question to ask what “Mr X”, who “always does the right thing” would do. They did this to be very clear that they were asking for moral judgements. The results were very similar to those from the first study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, the team had also asked the adults and kids to rate humans’, dogs’ and pigs’ intelligence and also capacity to feel pain, sadness and fear. Both adults and kids gave similar ratings for all three species, and agreed that people scored higher on these counts than dogs, who scored higher than pigs. “Yet despite this,” the team notes, “children and adults gave different moral judgements, which suggests that perceived intelligence and sentience does not fully account for moral judgements.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So why do adults have a much stronger pro-human bias? The team suspect that this is something that is learned relatively late in childhood. “Adolescents may learn and internalise the socially held speciesist notion — or ideology — that humans are morally special and deserve full moral status, whereas animals do not,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They do note, however, that their groups of US-based, primarily white, English-speaking participants from mostly urban areas is not exactly globally representative. It would be interesting, of course, to explore whether kids who grow up on farms, say, have different ideas about the relative importance of particular animals vs humans. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given my son’s (not unexpected) reaction to the dog vs people questions, the findings on kids are a little reassuring: he’s not unusual in feeling that way. I’m fairly sure, though, that if I’d got more personal, and asked him to choose between saving his younger brother or Dottie, our dog, he’d have gone for his brother, if only for my sake… I can tell him that he’s less “speciesist” than me, at least.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620960398&quot;&gt;Children Prioritize Humans Over Animals Less Than Adults Do&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knitting thick yarn is exponentially quicker than thin yarn, so I am already approaching done. Gunhild is knitted, steek-ed, and has edgings – just a soak, then blocking (persuading the knit fabric to reach its final intended shape).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was one major setback on the way – I ran out of the main colour yarn after adding some much needed bust space. And so, it turns out, had every yarn store on the continent. That particular burnt orange nuance was backlisted months in 50 different yarn stores. I should in retrospect of course have gotten an extra ball of yarn of each color; I only got an extra ball of the gray contrast yarn. So this Gunhild is unique, with contrast coloured half sleeves, and slightly different edging.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/01/26/us-politicians-use-moral-language-more-often-when-they-have-less-power/"/>

		<updated>2021-01-26T12:51:04+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whatever your political affiliation, making appeals to people’s morality can be a powerful rhetorical tool. Politicians frequently use language that refers to moral principles of harm, fairness, loyalty, authority and purity, in order to defend policy positions, appeal to new voters and appease old ones. And it’s an approach that seems to work. Research suggests that people are far more likely to take action once they connect a particular issue with their own moral or ethical convictions — even to the point of &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00254.x&quot;&gt;committing acts of violence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But how and when politicians use moral language shifts with changes in the political landscape, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620960397&quot;&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Toronto’s Sze-Yuh Nina Wang and Yoel Inbar, published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;. Looking at Democrat and Republican politicians in the US, they found that moral language increased as political power &lt;em&gt;decreased, &lt;/em&gt;suggesting that its use is not fixed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41228&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first study looked at public tweets posted by members of the Senate and the House of Representatives; some, like Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, had millions of followers, while others had thousands. Using a text-analysis technique, the team coded nearly 700,000 tweets posted between January 2016 and January 2018 from 578 politicians in Congress (385,206 from Democrats and 302,154 from Republicans).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team focused on five moral foundations — harm, fairness, loyalty, authority and purity — and their positive and negative aspects (“virtues” and “vices”). For the analysis, the tweets were compared to a dictionary containing words related to each virtue and vice, to see how close the language in each tweet was to these words. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, Democrats used moral language more frequently than Republicans. And while moral language was used more by both parties after the 2016 Presidential election, this increase was greater for Democrats, who were more likely to go on using moral language. This was also the case for those moral foundations more traditionally associated with Republicans (loyalty, authority and purity).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second study looked at transcripts of all debates and proceedings in Congress between 1981 and 2017, utilising the same text-analysis technique as in the first study. In both the House and the Senate, the minority party was far more likely to use moral language related to almost all of the foundations (a notable exception was language related to authority, which was sometimes used more frequently by the majority party).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results suggest that the use of moral language is dynamic rather than static, and likely to change over time depending on context. This makes sense — moral language is often ramped up during national crises, perhaps because there is more at stake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future research could look at what subjects are being discussed using moral language — is it being used on specific issues, or more broadly to condemn the opposing party? &lt;em&gt;Who&lt;/em&gt; is using such language also seems relevant. There are a huge range of divergent views even within a political party itself — a left wing politician like Bernie Sanders or Ilhan Omar is unlikely to share the exact moral values of the more centrist Nancy Pelosi, for example, even though they all belong to the Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620960397&quot;&gt;Moral-Language Use by U.S. Political Elites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2016/1/25/egypt-revolution-18-days-of-people-power&quot;&gt;masses marched to Midan Tahrir&lt;/a&gt; in Cairo, triggering a protest movement that resulted in the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak. “People are fed up of Mubarak and of his dictatorship and of his torture chambers and of his failed economic policies,” an &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2011/1/26/three-dead-in-egypt-protests&quot;&gt;Egyptian blogger told al-Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; at the time: “If Mubarak is not overthrown tomorrow then it will be the day after. If it’s not the day after it’s going to be next week.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years later, Mubarak is gone, but the country remains under the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/egypt-constitution/&quot;&gt;tight grip of a military leader&lt;/a&gt;, who recently extended his rule until 2030. Since April 2017, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has upheld a state of emergency which provides his &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://static1.squarespace.com/static/4f334481cb12c1acadc57623/t/589d8f9f37c5811653d89cd4/1486720954695/2016+Report+English.pdf&quot;&gt;security forces, known to terrorize political opponents and ordinary citizens&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2020/country-chapters/egypt&quot;&gt;unchecked power&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/07/24/egypt-new-ngo-law-renews-draconian-restrictions&quot;&gt;Human Rights Watch reported&lt;/a&gt; that 2,000 independent organizations have been shut down, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/2/9/egypt-shuts-el-nadeem-centre-for-torture-victims&quot;&gt;including the Nadeem Centre for victims of torture and violence&lt;/a&gt;. In December 2020, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/B-9-2020-0427_EN.html&quot;&gt;EU warned that the human rights situation in Egypt had deteriorated sharply&lt;/a&gt; over the last year, citing the arbitrary detainment of 4,000 citizens, imprisonment of 60,000 people on political grounds, the systematic enforced disappearance of political opponents, grave violations to the right to  life, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this climate, could we expect new mass protests to mark the ten-year anniversary of the Arab Spring? Based on interviews with participants and non-participants in the 2011 Egyptian and Moroccan uprisings, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://t.co/Sd3yRjdUoi?amp=1&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; investigates the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.dornschneider.net/data.php&quot;&gt;cognitive processes&lt;/a&gt; underlying the protests. The findings show that individuals joined the uprisings based on hot, positive emotions, which translated into protest decision with great speed. In contrast, decisions to stay at home were based on slow and cool reasoning processes focused on individual safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety considerations were so strong that they encouraged large numbers of people to abstain from the Arab Spring even if individuals approved of the protests and rejected the ruling regime. In the words of a non-participant: “&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.dornschneider.net/files/cogs.12762.pdf&quot;&gt;When people are killed, we must be careful. There are more important things than protest: safety and stability&lt;/a&gt;.” On the other hand, positive emotions of courage to face the government, hope that protest would succeed, solidarity with other protestors, and national pride were major contributors to the Arab Spring. These emotions were themselves triggered by the successful mass uprisings in Tunisia, unprecedented numbers of protest at home, and fellow citizens sacrificing their lives to face violent state authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current situation does not display these emotional triggers, but countless grounds for safety concerns. Nevertheless, hot cognition and emotion-based reasoning &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374533557&quot;&gt;happen fast&lt;/a&gt;, and researchers have observed that mass protests take off very suddenly, so that they “&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~public.econ.duke.edu/~tk43/abstracts/articles/ab_article_18A.htm&quot;&gt;will unavoidably continue to catch the world by surprise&lt;/a&gt;.” When Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire, nobody would have anticipated the subsequent Arab Spring. Similar triggers will occur in the Arab world, with the potential of translating into new uprisings. In the words of a Moroccan participant of the Arab Spring: “I am convinced that totalitarianism will disappear. For me it is not a question if that will happen, but how that will happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured image: &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tahrir_Square_-_February_9,_2011.png&quot;&gt;Tahrir Square&lt;/a&gt;, by Jonathan Rashad (CC BY 2.0)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/01/safety-first-considering-protest-reasoning-10-years-on-from-the-arab-spring/&quot;&gt;Safety first?

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please join us for two virtual NIH BRAIN Initiative meetings on Tuesday, January 26, 2021 and Wednesday, January 27, 2021. Videocast will be available for the BRAIN Neuroethics Working Group meeting and for the open session of the BRAIN Multi-Council Working Group meeting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-2983&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neuroethics Working Group meeting – Tuesday, January 26, 2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics-working-group&quot;&gt;Neuroethics Working Group (NEWG)&lt;/a&gt; will hold its eleventh meeting. Input from members of the NEWG helps to ensure that neuroethics is fully integrated into the BRAIN Initiative. The meeting will feature a presentation on emerging ethics themes within BRAIN by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bioethics.nih.gov/people/hendriks-bio.shtml&quot;&gt;Dr. Saskia Hendriks&lt;/a&gt; from the NIH Department of Bioethics. Then, the group will discuss plans for potential neuroethics workshops on several topics, including neural data privacy, ensuring inclusivity, and others. Lastly, in the context of existing themes within the BRAIN portfolio and potential emerging neuroethics topics of interest, the NEWG will revisit themes outlined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/strategic-planning/acd-working-groups/brain-initiative%C2%AE-and-neuroethics-enabling-and-enhancing&quot;&gt;BRAIN 2.0 neuroethics report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting will take place from &lt;strong&gt;12:00 PM – 3:20 PM (ET)&lt;/strong&gt; and anyone can tune in live via &lt;a href=&quot;https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=40155&quot;&gt;videocast&lt;/a&gt;. For more details, please view the &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics-working-group&quot;&gt;NEWG webpage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Council Working Group meeting – &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wednesday, January 27, 2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/about/multi-council-working-group&quot;&gt;Multi-Council Working Group (MCWG)&lt;/a&gt; will convene its eighteenth meeting to discuss the current state of BRAIN and the Initiative’s future. The meeting will feature updates from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/About-NINDS/Who-We-Are/staff/John-Ngai&quot;&gt;Dr. John Ngai&lt;/a&gt;, NIH BRAIN Initiative Director, and a presentation on training, inclusion, and equity (TIE) efforts by Drs. Jay Churchill and Michelle Jones-London. There will be a presentation on approaches to diversifying the scientific workforce by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nia.nih.gov/about/staff/bernard-marie&quot;&gt;Dr. Marie Bernard&lt;/a&gt;, Deputy Director of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://diversity.nih.gov/about-us&quot;&gt;acting NIH Chief Officer for Scientific Workforce Diversity&lt;/a&gt;, followed by a discussion on how the BRAIN Initiative will continue to promote these efforts. Lastly, NIH staff will present two concepts for funding: (1) short courses on neuroscience skills development; and (2) projects for building infrastructure for reagent development, production, and use at minority-serving and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/DRCB/IDeA/Pages/default.aspx&quot;&gt;IDeA&lt;/a&gt;-eligible institutions, which will expand upon a transformative project funding opportunity aimed to create “A Cell Type-Specific Armamentarium for Understanding Brain Function and Dysfunction” (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-20-556.html&quot;&gt;RFA-MH-20-556&lt;/a&gt;), as outlined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/strategic-planning/acd-working-groups/brain-initiative%C2%AE-20-cells-circuits-toward-cures&quot;&gt;BRAIN 2.0 neuroscience report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open session will take place from &lt;strong&gt;12:00 PM – 3:25 PM (ET)&lt;/strong&gt; and can be viewed live via &lt;a href=&quot;https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=40172&quot;&gt;videocast&lt;/a&gt;. To learn more, please see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/multi-council-working-group&quot;&gt;MCWG webpage&lt;/a&gt;.

		<link href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/XZpljA2M98A/"/>
		<id>https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18626</id>
		<updated>2021-01-21T16:58:24+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced an agreement for BTAA members to participate in PLOS’ Community Action Publishing (CAP) program. The agreement ensures time to test and evaluate this new community-based model and allows BTAA researchers to publish in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt; without incurring fees. The BTAA and PLOS will also collaborate on future data, metrics, and tools for institutions to evaluate Open Access publishing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The BTAA is the largest consortium globally to participate in both CAP communities, meaning that every member has committed to the full three-year pilot. As some of the largest research institutions in the world and major contributors to both journals, the BTAA commitment ensures this new collective action-based model kicks off with a strong foundation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Big Ten Academic Alliance members are: Indiana University, Michigan State University, Northwestern University, Ohio State University, Pennsylvania State University, Purdue University, Rutgers University–New Brunswick, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, University of Iowa, University of Maryland–College Park, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, University of Nebraska–Lincoln, University of Wisconsin–Madison, and the University of Chicago. PLOS has extended the benefits of this agreement to include most system, regional, and branch campuses of these universities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Big Ten Academic Alliance’s commitment to this community-driven model demonstrates the power of collectives to transform scholarly publishing. This collaboration has been a partnership from the beginning and BTAA’s members and administration have been vital in helping us build and execute on this new experiment in sustainable highly selective publishing.” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maurice York, BTAA’s Director of Library Initiatives, adds: “One of the key strategic questions in front of us is how to advance the growth of open science and open scholarship through collective and intentional action. We are actively seeking pathways to create a sustainable, scalable open knowledge ecosystem for our researchers and scholars. We are pleased to join together with PLOS to take up this pilot in common cause.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS’ Community Action Publishing (CAP) is PLOS’ effort to sustain highly selective journal publishing without Article Processing Charges for authors. More details about the model can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/publish/publishing-faqs/#plos-community-action-publishing&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The BTAA publishing deal continues the momentum for PLOS in 2020, following other agreements with the University of California system, Jisc (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester) and the Canadian Research Knowledge Network &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/&quot;&gt;among others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/01/plos-and-the-big-ten-academic-alliance-announce-publishing-deal/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PLOS and the Big Ten Academic Alliance Announce Publishing Deal&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Official PLOS Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;You know the way Google search will sometimes finish your sentences for you? Or, when you’re typing an email, there’s some ghostly predictive text that floats just in front of your cursor? Well, there’s a new kid on the block that makes these gadgets look like toy tricks out of a Christmas cracker. Give it a sentence of Jane Austen and it will finish the paragraph in the same style. Give it a philosophical conjecture and it will fill the page with near-coherent academic ruminations. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-020-09548-1&quot;&gt;GPT-3&lt;/a&gt; is essentially just predicting what words should come next, following on from the prompt it’s been given. That the machine does so well is partly because it’s been trained on an unimaginably huge database of samples of English (reputedly, $13 million worth of training). A similar machine can predict, from a sequence of amino acids, how the resulting protein will fold, short-cutting months of lab work and in some cases years of human ingenuity (&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology&quot;&gt;AlphaFold&lt;/a&gt;). But what is going on inside the machine? What is it keeping track of inside its huge neural network “brain”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We face the same question, of course, when we look at the human brain—a seemingly inscrutable organ of even greater complexity. Yet neuroscience is beginning to make sense of what’s going on inside: of patterns of activity distributed across millions of neurons, flowing into other patterns; coupling and modulating; unfolding in a way that opens the organism to the world outside, projected through its inner space of needs and drives, bathed in the wash of past experience, reaching out to control and modify that world to its own agenda. We can now see what some of these patterns of activity are, and we have an inkling of what they are doing, of how they track the environment, and subserve behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists are recording these patterns with new techniques. But what do the patterns mean? How should they be understood? Neuroscience is increasingly tackling these questions by asking what the activation patterns &lt;em&gt;represent&lt;/em&gt;. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627308009434&quot;&gt;“representational similarity analysis”&lt;/a&gt; (RSA) is used to ask whether the human brain processes images in the same way as the brain of the macaque monkey. Surprisingly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8619.short&quot;&gt;similar techniques&lt;/a&gt; can be used to compare the human brain to an AI computer system trained to perform the same task. These AIs are deep neural networks, cousins of the seemingly unfathomable GPT-3 and AlphaFold brains we met at the start. Astoundingly, it turns out that sometimes the deep neural network is processing images in roughly the same way as the human brain. In a general sense, both are performing the same computations en route to working out that they are looking at a picture of two cats on a sofa. In other cases, we see the brain using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~papers.nips.cc/paper/9104-better-transfer-learning-with-inferred-successor-maps&quot;&gt;hexagonal code&lt;/a&gt; to represent physical space—and more abstract conceptual spaces—and to reason about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this means that representation has become something of a hot topic in cognitive neuroscience. Representation has always been around, of course, working away in the foundations ever since the “cognitive revolution” showed that we could explain behaviour in terms of internal processing without having to feel embarrassed about intelligent homunculi or ghosts in the machine. What we have now are much better ways to see those representations in the brain and to marry them up with the computational story about how the organism intelligently deals with its environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“representation is the crucial link for connecting brain activity with functional, adaptive behaviour”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we still need is a proper understanding of what representation is—an understanding of how there come to be things in the head which stand in for, and allow creatures to deal with, things in their environment. A once-unconventional idea in contemporary philosophy (originating with Ruth Millikan, David Papineau, and Karen Neander) is that this is intimately tied up with function—biological functions based on natural selection. Although a connection to function may have always been implicit in some scientific practice, it is now being recognised explicitly (&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3017&quot;&gt;Hunt et al. 2012&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0520-2&quot;&gt;Richards et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;). For example, in a recent manifesto for the role of representation in computational cognitive neuroscience, Kriegeskorte and Diedrichsen (&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-neuro-080317-061906&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;) argue that representation is the crucial link for connecting brain activity with functional, adaptive behaviour. Meanwhile in philosophy, appealing to natural teleology to explain representation has moved into the mainstream, being embraced by researchers from diverse disciplinary starting points (&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10539-014-9432-4&quot;&gt;David Haig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-metaphysics-of-representation-9780198850205&quot;&gt;Robert Williams&lt;/a&gt;), alongside recent landmark contributions from early advocates (&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/mark-mental&quot;&gt;Karen Neander&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/beyond-concepts-9780198717195&quot;&gt;Ruth Millikan&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The devil is in the details, of course, but it is beginning to look as if we have the main ingredients in place: internal states that stand in useful relations to things in the environment, internal processing which relies on those relations, and the functions that serves for the organism. Just as the cognitive sciences come to lean on representation ever more heavily, it seems that we now have the resources to understand this foundational notion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feature image by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://stock.adobe.com/images/brain-data-ai-technology-robotic-molecule-of-chemical-atom-cell-science-hacker-online-cyber-network-system-of-background-illustration-3d-rendering-futuristic-cloud-storage-deep-learning/271835259&quot;&gt;issaronow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/01/what-is-representation-in-the-human-brain-and-ai-systems/&quot;&gt;What is “representation” in the human brain and AI systems?&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/641921470/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/641921470/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/641921470/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/02/what-role-does-culture-play-in-shaping-childrens-school-experiences/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;What role does culture play in shaping children’s school experiences?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2021/01/safety-first-considering-protest-reasoning-10-years-on-from-the-arab-spring/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Safety first?

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, CA and OTTAWA, ON — The Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN) and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced an agreement for CRKN members to participate in PLOS’ Community Action Publishing (CAP) program, a new collective action publishing model from PLOS, enabling 19 participating CRKN institutions to publish fee-free in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; PLOS&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Biology. &lt;/em&gt;This model shifts publishing costs from authors to research institutions based on prior publishing history as affiliated with corresponding and contributing authors. The group collectively contributes to the shared cost recovery target and any surplus revenue collected by PLOS is redistributed to members.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are delighted to welcome PLOS’ very first Canadian partners to our Community Action Publishing program. Despite a very difficult budget landscape, Canadian institutions’ commitment to community-driven Open Access experimentation remains as strong as ever,” said Sara Rouhi, director of strategic partnerships for PLOS. “As ever, we’re excited to partner with institutions sharing our mission to further equitable and barrier free open reading and publishing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CRKN members’ participation in this innovative publishing initiative from PLOS highlights Canada’s dedication to furthering open access,” commented Clare Appavoo, Executive Director of CRKN. “Bold ideas drive our community forward, and it is inspiring to see publishers like PLOS advancing new business models for open scholarship. We look forward to collaborating with PLOS as the model and program develop.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CRKN participating members include: Brock University, McMaster University, Mount Allison University, Mount Saint Vincent University, Ontario Tech University, Queen’s University, Simon Fraser University, Université Laval, University of Alberta, University of Guelph, University of Manitoba, University of New Brunswick, University of Ottawa, University of Saskatchewan, University of Toronto, University of Waterloo, Western University, Wilfrid Laurier University, and York University.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the Community Action Publishing agreement, which began on January 1, 2021, authors from participating CRKN institutions will have unlimited publishing in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; through a collective action model. Both corresponding and contributing authors affiliated with participating CRKN institutions are eligible, and new institutions are permitted to join the agreement at any time during this initial three-year period. The model itself is predicated on cost recovery, capped margins, and redistributing revenues above target back to community members.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CRKN, which represents 81 academic and research institutions across Canada, joins the University of California and Jisc (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester) among others in signing open access publishing agreements with PLOS in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-12242 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/COVID-19-300x180.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ladds et. al&lt;/em&gt; describes “long Covid” as fluctuating symptoms such as coughing, breathlessness, fever, sore throat, chest pain, palpitations, cognitive deficits, myalgia, neurological symptoms, skin rashes, and diarrhoea beyond 3-4 weeks after infection. Despite the great advances in COVID-19 research, there is minimal knowledge about managing “long Covid”. This is emphasized by the participant’s instrumental role in the recruitment and development of this study. This online qualitative study reports the experiences of 114 participants from the UK weeks after their acute illness to better understand COVID-19. These focus groups reveal that those who experience “long Covid” endure difficulty accessing health services despite their uncertain prognosis and occasionally severe reoccurring symptoms. This study informs a basis to improve services while highlighting the importance of patient support groups to better navigate this ambiguous illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As cannabis consumption increases worldwide, it is crucial to investigate the effects of prenatal and maternal cannabis use on birth outcomes. &lt;em&gt;Michalski et al&lt;/em&gt;. observe that pre-pregnancy cannabis users experience 2.0 times the odds of birthing an infant with low birth weight, small size for gestational age, or preterm birth. Here, 216 women self-reported cannabis use in their pre/early pregnancy period while disclosing low rates of concurrent substance use such as alcohol and tobacco. While many studies aim to investigate this trend among pregnant women, this Ontario-based study confirms the specific impacts of cannabis use on infant health. Although there is more research to complete in regards to other modes of cannabis consumption, this study emphasizes the need for clinical messaging to expecting mothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12243&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/Pesticides-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boedeker et. al&lt;/em&gt; performed a systematic review examining the prevalence of a widely overlooked national and international public health issue called unintentional, acute pesticide poisoning. This study identified that farm workers and farmers account for 385 million cases of unintentional acute pesticide poisoning cases and around 11,000 deaths per year due to occupational exposure. Boedecker and team conclude this only accounts for a fraction of annual poisonings as registers and hospitals may underreport non-fatal events. Unfortunately, unintentional acute pesticide poisoning can lead to chronic outcomes such as a decreased quality of life or even the inability to continue working arguing the imperative of enhancing the accuracy of national databases and improving access to medical care and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the availability of mental health care for migrant populations who continue to experience high levels of mental health issues. By conducting semi-structured interviews with 10 psychotherapists across Germany whom have experience in dealing with refugee’s mental health problems, the authors were able to identify three main challenges in this cross-cultural practice. These include, differing or unrealistic expectations of clients towards what psychotherapy may offer, challenges integrated in illness explanatory models and communication challenges. Aside from identifying the main challenges with cross-cultural psychotherapy the authors showed that psychotherapy with refugees can be extremely successful but identifies challenges that underline the importance of designing and introducing new structural approaches to training psychotherapists for the introduction of psychotherapy at scale. As the incidence of mental health problems among refugee populations continues to increase, the ability to provide appropriate mental health support to these vulnerable individuals becomes ever more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Governments and health systems, dealing with end-of-life issues presents a major challenge. Despite progress in the introduction of relevant legislature, many barriers still exist to its proper implementation. By conducting 37 in-depth interviews with professionals and decision makers associated with the health care system in Israel the authors were able to identify 6 major barriers to coping with end-of-life issues. These include, Law procedures, Clinical aspects, Human aspects, Knowledge/skill, Communication and finally Resource allocation. They find that ubiquitously the relationship between the patient and their clinical care teams is important. With medical teams often in daily contact with the patient they inherit significant responsibility in implementation of end-of-life care. The authors conclude that by improving or championing accessibility to homes able to provide appropriate care for end-of-life needs, increased public and health system awareness, and support in understanding end-of-life laws, health systems and governments can aim to ensure the best care for end-of-life patients.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A recently issued Notice (NOT-MH-21-155)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;increases the available funds and anticipated number of awards for the funding opportunity announcement BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) Scalable Technologies and Tools for Brain Cell Census (RFA-MH-21-140).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-2980&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we &lt;a href=&quot;https://brainupdate.nih.gov/2020/12/29/congress-passes-budget-bill-nih-brain-initiative-receives-60m-in-additional-funds-for-fiscal-year-2021/&quot;&gt;announced earlier&lt;/a&gt;, Congress recently authorized an increase in appropriated funds to the NIH BRAIN Initiative in 2021 compared to 2020. This includes $40M for The Human Brain Cell Atlas, one of the transformative projects outlined in &lt;a href=&quot;https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/images/brain_2.0_6-6-19-final_revised10302019_508c.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BRAIN 2.0: From Cells to Circuits, Toward Cures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. With these funds now available, NIH has released a Notice (&lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-21-155.html&quot;&gt;NOT-MH-21-155&lt;/a&gt;) increasing the available funds and anticipated number of awards for &lt;a href=&quot;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-21-140.html&quot;&gt;RFA-MH-21-140 (BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) Scalable Technologies and Tools for Brain Cell Census (R01))&lt;/a&gt;. BRAIN intends to commit an estimated total of $12M per year to fund 6-10 awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This funding opportunity announcement aims to accelerate the integration and use of scalable technologies and tools to enhance brain cell census research.

 &lt;h4&gt;To spike or not to spike?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*f-PUy8OtUgBjR9CStS5Jzw.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is well known that a neuron is the main cell of the nervous system. It generates electrical pulses as large as 0.1Volts, has sprouts — axons (as long as 1 meter) and dendrites (several millimeters), and lives more than 100 years. You will not find another more marvelous cell in the body. Still, I will not write about biological details (despite how interesting they are). Rather, I will try to define the most important computational principles, which might help with the progression to artificial intelligence (AI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convergence towards principles always leads to simplification and generalization, but it can be dangerous. The brain is too diverse. You can simplify too much and lose something important. Let’s dare to try. Ultimately, it is an iterative process. We merely want to become less wrong with time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle 1. Neurons are binary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neuron generates and transmits electrical pulses (also called spikes). They are very similar in amplitude and duration, so they can be treated as binary events (spike=1, no spike=0). Yet, we don’t fully understand how exactly thousands and millions of neurons represent knowledge, perform basic calculations, and store casual relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some neurons transmit information by the frequency of spikes. For example, the more a motor-neuron activates in the spinal cord, the stronger the muscle contracts. For a long time, people thought that other neurons in the cerebral cortex send information in a similar way. After the famous Hubel and Wiesel experiments, we know that a neuron in a visual area has a higher spike frequency for a particular stimulus. If the cat sees the vertical line, a particular neuron activates very fast, but if we rotate the line — the neuron slows down. This can be summarized in a tuning curve:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/325/1*fpzzvLZv1y6FskcgHK0FCA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many decades, the idea of frequency coding was dominant. Even now, artificial neural networks use the same coding (real numbers). But a nasty problem ruins the frequency view: to “measure” the rate of firing you need to wait for a long time (hundreds of milliseconds) to average spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the brain computes much faster. Humans need around 100 ms to recognize an object. Information travels from the retina to the thalamus, then is projected to the visual cortex, where it hops across three or four areas before reaching the IT area. Here the recognition of an object occurs. Taking into account the time for spike generation (2–5 ms) and spike propagation (roughly 10–20ms), there is just enough time to send 1–2 pulses… and no way to wait longer to “send” the frequency of firing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, individual spikes (0 or 1) somehow should be enough to transmit information. Currently, the prevailing idea is that an individual neuron does not send a lot, but many of them can encode anything (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_coding#Population_coding&quot;&gt;population coding&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, my friend asked me: “How does the brain encode information? Perhaps with something super complex?”. “No”, I said. “Most likely, it uses a binary code similar to computers, but the principles are very different.” Neural coding is one of the most compelling areas of research with many mysteries and open problems. Intriguingly, it relates nicely to information theory. It is not just about data representation, but about something fundamental, about the organization of matter to reflect nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though we are still far from fully understanding the neural code. There are bursting neurons that emit many spikes very fast. Can we simplify the burst of pulses as one binary event? Neuromodulators change how the neuron is excited. Possibly, different brain regions (like sensory and motor) use different coding schemes. Yet, most likely the main tasks like recognition, memory, and planning use binary codes (that can be modulated in various ways).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle 2. Neurons integrate information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical neuron in neocortex has around 10 000 connections and more than 100 of them are active simultaneously. Information integration means that a neuron “hears” all 10 thousand “calls” and compresses them to 0 or 1 (spike or no spike). Mathematically, 10 thousand neurons can be active in 2¹⁰⁰⁰⁰ possible ways (0 or 1 for each input). We could enumerate and put all of them into a table (two columns, 2¹⁰⁰⁰⁰ rows) but even the whole universe could not store it. Alternatively, we can write the table in a compact form as some function (y=f(x)).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/733/1*YKHv4Y7JMOot_27ipsYtnA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the biggest advantage of a neuron is that it can change its inner parameters (like the weights &lt;strong&gt;w &lt;/strong&gt;in artificial neurons). Biologically, these parameters are realized as synapses between neurons, or as a distribution of ion channels on a membrane, or other molecules that determine the excitability of a cell. By changing the parameters, a neuron can change its function, its answers to 10 000 inputs. Parameters add new columns to this gigantic table and can be written as a parametric function y=f(x, w). The number of different functions the neuron can realize is called expressivity. The larger the expressivity, the more ways a neuron can integrate information. And it is crucial for learning, which is essentially a search for the right function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last 20 years, people showed that the expressivity of a biological neuron is much larger than previously thought. It turns out that the dendrites do not simply transmit the signal to the center of a cell but process it along the way. If a local dendritic branch gets activated too much, it can amplify the signal (an event called a dendritic spike).Thus, synapses that are active close in space and time excite the cell much larger than simultaneous but non-local signals. This is important: read it once more. Here is a helpful picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/892/1*T7fePm4EPGdF7FizBYzeaQ.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the left, three axons (in color) bring the activation from three neurons and spread their synapses randomly. On the right, synapses concentrate locally. The right neuron is excited more, and more likely generates an action potential (the figure shows three axons for simplicity, usually a neuron needs more to fire).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, not only the strength of a connection is important but its location. Because of this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00300/full&quot;&gt;people argued&lt;/a&gt; for a new learning paradigm: not only the weights but their locations also store information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The larger the dendritic tree, the more ways to arrange synapses, thus the more ways to activate the neuron and the larger the expressivity. Interestingly, evolutionary smarter animals have a larger dendritic tree. The picture below shows the pyramidal neurons of 1.Bat, 2.Rat, 3.Cat, 4. Dolphin (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elib.oa.edu.ua/items/show/1153&quot;&gt;source &lt;/a&gt;in Russian). Similarly, humans have more elaborate dendritic trees compared to chimpanzees (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/23/10/2429/295312&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). Maybe, with more powerful neurons animals get higher intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/380/1*kZMZ5wS_4_uVEPbB37y4Lw.png&quot; /&gt;Pyramidal neurons of 1.Bat, 2.Rat, 3.Cat, 4. Dolphin&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old models of a neuron (like ReLU or threshold) are called “point” models. They do not include dendrites and are computationally weaker. Such models people still use in artificial neural networks and do not want to adopt new, more complex neurons. One of the reasons is that it’s not clear how to learn a new model with active dendrites. Another reason is that by collecting together many simple neurons you can achieve the same expressivity as a single complex neuron. So, more or less, a two-layer network corresponds to a biological neuron. Read a really &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/your-cortex-contains-17-billion-computers-9034e42d34f2&quot;&gt;captivating article&lt;/a&gt; that explains it in depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, even this is an overly simplistic view — a real neuron is more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle 3. Neurons integrate information in time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spike or not to spike is the final result of all preceding computations. Still, it doesn’t simply discharge like a capacitor. The neuron remembers what happened before. Mathematically, a neuron is a complex dynamical system with time-varying parameters. Simple neuronal models can not describe all phenomena. For example, the same inputs at one time elicit activation and at another — don’t. A neuron remembers not simply a correct combination of neurons among 10 000 but &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;this combination occurs. As if the neuron looks over the window &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt; back in time and makes a decision (0 or 1) based on (2¹⁰⁰⁰⁰)^T possible scenarios. It opens the way for remembering sequences by a single neuron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such mechanism of integration across time is the control of neuronal excitability. Once a neuron becomes active from a stimulus “A” it can change its inner parameter (for example the concentration of the protein &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CREB&quot;&gt;CREB&lt;/a&gt;) to make itself more easily activated in the future. Even after many hours, this neuron will be activated from another stimulus “B” with a higher probability. One neuron gets activated for two stimuli and links them together. Since the memory is stored distributed across many neurons there will be an overlapping population of cells that stored a causal relationship “A-&amp;gt;B” . Changing neuronal excitability may be the way we form episodic memory (here is a nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069162.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190069162-e-7&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/444/1*mo81zqIUIPg3rqjSSVSqVg.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another mechanism is when a neuron stores sequential information in other neurons. Active neurons excite other cells and shape a particular network activity (called the “context”). After a certain time, the context may cause the activation of some other neuron. This neuron encodes the previous history (a sequence) that shaped that context. This is the domain of recurrent neural networks in which it is extremely hard to unravel the chain of computations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/290/1*2CRtXL1zUu2SJLG3pnV8YQ.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet another way how a neuron preserves memory is via its spines, the places where axons attach the dendrites. They also have inner parameters that can be changed to store information. One hypothesis (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_tagging&quot;&gt;synaptic tagging&lt;/a&gt;) proposes that spines “remember” the previous activation by expressing some tag. Later, the activation of a synapse interferes with the tag, which makes the connection stronger. That is why sometimes people argue for learning of different time scales (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06258&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Some parameters can change quickly in response to rapid events. And some change very slowly, reflecting things happening over minutes, hours and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lesson is — the neurons are very variable. They can change themselves (ion channels, spines, other proteins…) to record the spatial and temporal activation of the network overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle 4. Neurons learn … to survive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neuron is a living cell, and like any other it has needs. It consumes a lot of energy to fire electrical pulses. This energy must come from somewhere. Here neurons receive help from astrocytes, supportive glial cells, that live close to neurons, with around one astrocyte for three neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes sense when the neuron becomes active and change the permeability of blood capillaries to increase the flow of oxygen and glucose. These molecules are consumed by neuronal mitochondria that stores energy in the molecule ATP. Once, I had an Aha moment: “The goal of a neuron to become active to get nutrients. It activates and learns to survive!” Subsequently, I did not find any facts that support or reject this idea (that neuronal activity is the only way to get “food”). But the idea is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another similar and verified idea is homeostasis: a neuron sustains a target level of firing. If the activity exceeds or falls under the target level, the neuron launches the mechanics to return to this level. For example, a neuron can strengthen or weaken its connections (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_scaling&quot;&gt;synaptic scaling&lt;/a&gt;) or change its threshold for firing an action potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An interesting idea is that to be active just enough neurons change not only themselves, but try to change other neurons. They compete and cooperate with each other. A neuron tries to become active and prevent its neighbors from firing, a process called “winner takes all”. Or neurons try to “help” other distant neurons by activating them (hoping they will return the favour sometime). Of course, it is just a story where neurons, like warriors on a battlefield, survive, fight, create alliances. Nevertheless, it helps to link many experimental facts. Neurons indeed can activate local inhibitory cells that in turn decrease activation of other local neurons (“competition”). In addition, neurons in the visual cortex create distant connections with other neurons that encode similar stimuli (“cooperation”). Still, to confirm the story many experiments need to be done. And hopefully we will answer one of the most important questions in learning — how neurons choose with whom to connect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote that a neuron tracks the combinations among 10 000 connected neurons. Actually, it learns to recognize among 100,000 neurons. If two neurons are not connected but the axon of the first is close to the dendrite of a second, a connection may arise. It is structural plasticity — the creation and deletion of connections. A typical neuron in the neocortex has approximately 100,000 potential candidates to form the connection. What a possibility to reshape the network!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structural plasticity is prominent especially in children, who have a lot of excessive synapses. With aging (till around 30 years) the connections are pruned and the most valuable remain. The speed of this process varies in different brain regions: in some, like the parietal and frontal cortex, it takes longer to fully mature. But how to choose which connections to delete? One of the answers is the principle “use it or lose it”. Connections that are used rarely get eliminated. It is a highly selective procedure — one axon may climb to a particular neuron avoiding everyone else on its way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many theories of synaptic plasticity explain the changing of the strength of connections. Still, it is not completely clear how precise this strength might be. In artificial neural networks, the weight is a real number, for instance, 0.63737. True, neuronal spines vary in shape and size and a neuron can change the number and effectiveness of ion channels through which the positive ions pass and excite it ( ehh, I have to skip so many fascinating details). &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/10778&quot;&gt;Some estimates&lt;/a&gt; show that a synapse can store 4.7 bits of information, so it has 2^(4.7)=26 different states. Hence, learning is the change from one state to another. However, it is still debatable how long and how reliably the spine can remain in a given state. At least, we can treat the spine as one bit of information: are the two neurons connected? (And a couple more bits for the location of the synapse on a dendrite).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle 5. Neurons make errors and it’s okay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, synapses are very unreliable and stochastic. Often, neurons fail to transmit the signal, neurotransmitters may be “stuck” inside the axon. The successful transmission happens with some probability. That is why it is hard to reason about the strength of the connection. Interestingly, it may be not the weakness of evolution that could not invent reliable wires, but the discovery of how to make learning more efficient. Some theories suggest that stochastic connections may actually help. Neurons in some animals can change the probability of synaptic release as a way of learning (see a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2634&quot;&gt;good review&lt;/a&gt;). How common is this phenomenon in the human brain? How important is it computationally? We don’t know. New research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not just synapses, but neurons can be noisy as well. Sometimes they can even die. In some brain regions the death of neurons is very bad. Like in the brain stem where neurons control breathing, blood pressure, and sustain life. However, in most regions neurons might die and nothing terrible will happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the loss of some transistors could damage the whole chip and the computer stops working. Brain architecture is evolved to be stable to errors, to failure of neurons and synapses. Information is encoded in a large population of neurons, from multiple modalities (vision, hearing…). Thus, there is no grandmother neuron, the neuron that encodes only the grandmother. Otherwise, when that neuron dies — the memory is lost. One neuron does not encode only one stimulus but many. One memory is encoded in many neurons. If some cells make errors, no worries, the information remains. In case of massive cell death, like in a stroke, a function of the neurons might weaken, but later neuroplasticity reassigns the overload among other neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an important principle: if you build AI with brain-like neuronal networks, you must ask yourself “will my algorithm still work if I remove 10% of neurons? Or 20%?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surely, this was not a complete list of all principles. But these five are among the most important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, you will remember that a neuron is a living cell. It doesn’t care about information processing and computation, it just wants to survive. Yet, it is fascinating that, while surviving, a neuron makes computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am thankful to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/6bce9fc81f1f&quot;&gt;Mark Humphries&lt;/a&gt; for suggestions and saving this article from a grammatical mess :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow on: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/ai.territory&quot;&gt;Facebook &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AiTerritory&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the fifth article in the blog series “AI Territory”.

 &lt;p&gt;Open Science is not a finish line, but rather a means to an end. An underlying goal behind the movement towards Open Science is to conduct and publish more reliable and thoroughly reported research. Increasing the transparency, reusability and connectivity of scientific outputs is a common desire shared among publishers and researchers, but progress can seem slow and implementation far from widespread. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Akin to how scientific understanding is often achieved through incremental progress, system-wide changes toward Open Science will only be achieved through earnest collaboration among funders, institutions, publishers and researchers. Looking at both pragmatic solutions and the underlying ideals, we imagine changes to scientific publishing in the context of four fundamental functions that publishers should provide: dissemination, verification, recognition and community building. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Dissemination&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can the future provide more usable, accessible and relevant dissemination? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The term “research article” is largely used as a catch-all for published discoveries. A research article is typically consumed as a static PDF that’s sent to publishers after results have been accrued and conclusions drawn. Readers must wait until the study is complete and the associated paper published before they can access the methodology, which may have been finalized months or years prior. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Breaking down the research article into more digestible and structured parts—or modules—can provide researchers with more opportunities to reuse and improve research. Incomplete reporting of methods in traditional articles can prevent research from being reused or reproduced. More opportunities to publish detailed and enhanced methods are the two article types coming soon to &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/protocols/&quot;&gt;Lab Protocols and Study Protocols&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lab Protocols, developed in partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://protocols.io&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt;, share the step-by-step instructions for verified methodologies and computational techniques. Utilizing the specialised features of protocols.io’s platform in conjunction with a peer-reviewed article on &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; that contextualizes the presented methodology, Lab Protocols will provide readers with the information needed to replicate a validated method in a precise and accessible format. Study Protocols are open for planned research studies, giving readers an opportunity to see design and analysis plans and helping reduce waste and bias in research. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the future, studies should be presented as a collection of interlinked research objects and associated metadata. Data, code, protocols, and other elements such as reagents can all be independently identified and verified, allowing for readers to more easily find and access the elements most relevant to them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Verification&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can widespread adoption of Open Science provide more reliable and reproducible research?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ultimate test for the reporting and validity of a study is whether it can be fully reproduced by different researchers. The materials used, the steps of the methods and the experimental conditions must be precisely described for a study to be reproducible. Reproduction of previous research can be a jumping-off point for contemporary researchers that leads to new discoveries. In short, proper reporting helps advance the field and accelerate further discoveries. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On platforms such as protocols.io, researchers can verify if published protocols work for them. Alongside participating researchers, publishers are important in the verification of publications by organising peer review, which can be customised for different research outputs. For Lab Protocols, &lt;em&gt;PLOS&lt;/em&gt; will be organizing peer review of submitted manuscripts and content hosted on protocols.io: a small step toward extending the value publishers can offer in verifying the validity of research and improving trust in new research formats. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Transparency enables verification. &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/&quot;&gt;Preregistration&lt;/a&gt; enables interrogation of what was planned and what was carried out, and publishing peer reviews and preprints allow readers to view changes that occur during peer review. Direct links to deposited data and executable code gives an opportunity to work with the same material as the original authors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having these elements—protocols, data, code, review history—available and linked to research articles reduces dependencies on the original authors of a study, promoting efficiency. A study that can be replicated with available and easy-to-find information allows the research to be usable far in the future. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Recognition&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can reward and incentive systems be improved to provide researchers with credit for more of their research? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The perceived success of a researcher has traditionally been dependent on the credit they receive through publications. Career advancement and other rewards can be determined by how research outputs are valued and recognized, and thus recognizing diverse and more granular research contributions beyond publications is essential for researchers to be rewarded for their work appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CRediT—required by all PLOS authors and publications—offers a more nuanced view of authorship and contributorship. By providing new opportunities for peer-reviewed publications that reward critical but sometimes overlooked contributions, such as a methods development, publishers can provide opportunities for diverse elements of the research process to be better recognized. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peer-reviewed protocols give authors a formal publication that enables their methods to be cited, shared and used as a signal of accomplishment. Similar opportunities exist for sharing, describing and citing research datasets and software, which need to be more widely adopted by the wider scientific community, furthering chances for additional recognition. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Publishers are just part of the solution. Institutions and funders can work with publishers to recognise and reward researchers for working transparently and reproducibly. Researchers can benefit personally from presenting their research in open, reusable formats as this can drive collaboration and reuse—and can consider Open Science principles when assessing studies by their peers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Community Building&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can Open Science provide more opportunities to collaborate and connect? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scientific community has made great progress in making Coronavirus research as Open as possible. With authors across disciplines depositing their articles as preprints and publishers making relevant research fully accessible, the benefits of Open Science have been made even clearer. By connecting researchers through peer review and providing structures to make relevant research shareable and accessible without barriers, journals help researchers build and maintain their communities. The role journals have in supporting these communities will continue to evolve as innovative new ways for researchers to collaborate and connect develop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If these sweeping changes have helped improve scientific discovery in a period of global need, they could be adopted in other areas of research. Comprehensive commitment to Open Science requires the full scientific community, as publishers alone cannot persuade such practices to be adopted. For research to be more efficiently disseminated, verified and credited, system-wide changes toward Open Access must be embraced across the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/09/iStock-653873888-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Background&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent publications have focused excessively on the mode of delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go beyond the sole question of the mode of delivery, an ontological approach was applied to understand the observation of perinatal morbidity. Indeed, unmeasured fetal and maternal factors can at least partly explain the breech delivery dilemma (planned cesarean section or trial of labor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What are the unresolved questions?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the weakness of a unique randomized trial, nor the imperfection of the older observational population based studies could clearly help explain the observed increase of perinatal morbidity with breech delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some authors argue that planned cesarean section may decrease perinatal morbidity. However, this argument does not take into account potential complications for subsequent pregnancies and the maternal choice to avoid a cesarean section, especially in favorable cases of breech vaginal delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, planned vaginal delivery could also be harmful and potentially unethical in unselected women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we identify a need for an individualized approach to the management of term breech presentation, as outlined in our recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-2831-4?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Debate paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12235&quot; style=&quot;width: 570px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12235&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/01/ff-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 1: The complex puzzle of breech presentation&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deterministic or accidental breech presentation? &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several recent population-based data studies reported that breech presentation was associated with prenatal factors that could also be related to maternal and/or perinatal morbidity and mortality. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fetal : fetal growth restriction, oligohydramnios, congenital fetal malformation, unknown breech presentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maternal : gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and a history of CS, congenital uterine malformation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings are in line with the greater risk of term antepartum stillbirth in breech presentation as compared to cephalic presentation (2-2.5‰ versus 0.5-1.5‰)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These points highlight the importance of screening for breech presentation of pregnancy at and beyond 36 weeks of pregnancy as well as estimating fetal weight (restriction or overgrowth) and well-being in cases of persistent breech presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Strict selection for favorable attempt breech delivery&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most national guidelines now (American, British, French, Australian and New-Zealand) propose comparable pre-established criteria for a careful selection of favorable cases for breech vaginal delivery, allowing an informed maternal choice. In contrast, without such strict selection, intrapartum cesarean section accounts for a greater proportion of maternal and perinatal morbidity and maternal morbidity than planned vaginal / cesarean delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, national guidelines and criteria for the management of term breech presentation should include: obstetric history, estimated fetal weight &amp;lt;3,800 g, non-hyper extended head on ultrasound, no evidence of antenatal fetal compromise and adequate mother pelvic size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the use of pelvimetry remains a matter of debate, recent studies confirmed findings of an older randomized trial suggesting that adequate pelvic size measurement may improve the selection of delivery route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence register studies support this view of a selection quality for candidate to vaginal breech delivery by the low conversion rate of vaginal to CS breech delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;How might we maximize patient benefit from a safe external cephalic version attempt?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current guidelines recommended external cephalic version (ECV) to limit the increase in elective CS rate for cases of term breech presentation. The true impact of ECV may first be limited by the timely detection of breech presentation and contraindications. Such screening should allow timely ECV at 36 weeks’ gestation and a careful evaluation of potential underlying antenatal risks, considering obstetric history, estimated fetal weight/growth and potential gestational disorders before ECV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, pregnancy with obstetrical factors (such as GDM) and fetal factors (such as footling breech or SGA), may particularly benefit from successful ECV at 36 weeks to avoid subsequent induction of labor with breech presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retrospective population based studies also highlighted that successful ECV for breech presentation are at increased risk for CS delivery, as compared with spontaneous cephalic presentation. Therefore, practitioners should understand that successful ECV is not the end of breech presentation management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Towards an individualized approach&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mode of delivery and breech presentation is only the tip of the iceberg (fig 2). It implies that planned cesarean section without understanding the underlying obstetrical condition cannot fully prevent increased perinatal morbidity associated with breech presentation. It also means that without strict selection, the higher perinatal morbidity after planned ECV and vaginal delivery suggested by some studies (as opposed to planned cesarean section) may become a .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 36 weeks of pregnancy, one must thoroughly consider obstetric history and fetal weight estimates based on clinical and ultrasound examinations, despite the large confidence interval of all available algorithms for producing such estimates, we advise that pelvic examination should be performed. Although radiologic or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pelvimetry is not universally recommended, its contribution provides very useful criteria to rule out pathological pelvic contraction for the preselection of planned modes of delivery and the counselling of women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, timely ECV should be proposed in light of the eligibility and possible benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience of the health care team/ availability of clinical skills is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, regardless of the planned mode of delivery, adequate follow-up during the last weeks of pregnancy is needed and subject to decision-making based on the continuous evaluation of risk factors, medical history, possible underlying disorders and comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;
