&lt;p&gt;Humans are infovores, hungry to discover, and nothing holds more fascination than the future. Once we looked for answers through divination, now science can forecast significant events such as the onset of certain hereditary disease. But the fact that some people choose &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;to know – even when information is accessible, and has a bearing on their lives – has encouraged scientists, including Gerd Gigerenzer and Rocio Garcia-Retamero, to try to map out the limits of our appetite for knowledge. Their &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/rev/124/2/179/&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychological Review&lt;/i&gt; suggests that it is a fear of what we might discover – and wishing that we’d never known – that often drives us to deliberate ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-23103&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gigerenzer, Director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, and Garcia-Retamero at the University of Granada, asked nationally representative samples of participants in Germany and Spain whether they would be willing to know the date or cause of their own or their partner’s death; whether their marriage would end in divorce; as well as information relating to positive future events like knowing the gender of their unborn child, or what was in store for them under the Christmas wrapping paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas previous research with people at heightened risk of specific diseases found rates of deliberate ignorance of between 10 and 30 per cent, the rates here were far higher. Close to 90 per cent of participants said they’d prefer not to know about future negative events (this tended to generalise: a person who didn’t want to know about one negative outcome usually said they didn’t want to know about any others). Rates of deliberate ignorance were also high for positive events, but more variable – only a third of participants said they did not want to know their child’s gender, for instance, compared with three quarters preferring not to know the outcome of a football match they were watching. So wilful ignorance is commonplace, but what’s driving it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gigerenzer and Garcia-Retamero’s suspicion is that it’s about anticipated regret: people’s fear that they may regret hearing what’s going to happen; after all, you can’t “unknow” an unwelcome fact. People susceptible to fearing regret also tend to be risk-averse: taking risks often involves seeing the repercussions of your decision, whereas ducking a gamble simply leaves you in the dark – you’ll never know what might have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test whether anticipated regret was driving deliberate ignorance, Gigerenzer and Garcia-Retamero asked their participants to complete classic measures of risk aversion, like choosing between the option of different sized cash sums now versus a 50 per cent chance to win 100 Euros, with preference for guaranteed lower sums corresponding to more risk aversion. Supporting their explanation, the researchers found that the participants who’d been keener to stay in deliberate ignorance were also more risk averse. This was true for positive events too, where the regret is related to the possibility of spoiling enjoyable suspense – such as asking to know the football results because the game seems lifeless but then discovering that it turned into a 3-2 nailbiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also consistent with the anticipated regret hypothesis was the finding that participants were more in favour of ignorance when events were imminent. So 13 per cent of under-35s said they would want to know about the date their partner would die, for example, but only 8 per cent of over-50s (similarly 54 per cent of the younger group said they’d want to know about life after death compared with 46 per cent of the older group).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems surprising, because information about an imminent outcome is usually considered more relevant, and we tend to think of the young as uninterested in the future and living for today. But if it is regret that’s driving things, it makes more sense: a youngster discovering that they will die in their 60s, not the more typical 70s, is unlikely to be devastated by the bad news, but for a 60-year-old, this is too ugly a fact to risk knowing. The researchers also found that participants who bought more insurance policies – a real-world measure of risk avoidance – were also slightly more likely to choose deliberate ignorance for the future events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a purely rational perspective, it seems surprising that so many people shy away from potentially useful information. Knowing the timing of your future demise could shape how you save for old age, for example, while learning whether an infinite existence lies beyond death would likely shape how you approach this life. But it seems many of us prefer ignorance, driven by the fear that we might regret discovering something better left unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/rev/124/2/179/&quot;&gt;Cassandra’s regret: The psychology of not wanting to know&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;10_1&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/10_1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-0900-8&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in BMC Evolutionary Biology demonstrated that a transplanted soft coral from the Caribbean Sea (Antillogorgia bipinnata) changed its shape consistently as the corals living in the new environment. This type of manipulation known as “common garden experiments” allowed the authors to determine the adaptive value of that change that means life or death for a species across a depth gradient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;2&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-8891&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/2-225x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This individual capacity is called phenotypic plasticity when the same genotype can exhibit several phenotypes due to environmental influences, and it is the equivalent of a person getting a tan after some holidays on a sunny beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are many different types of skin and some people can hardly get any tan whereas others can be unrecognizable. The coral studied by Iván Calixto-Botía and Juan Sánchez from the University of the Andes in Bogotá, Colombia, is the kind that changes dramatically its tree-like shape to an extent that the extremes have even been considered as different species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That observation was also published in BMC Evolutionary Biology by Sánchez and collaborators ten years ago. &lt;em&gt;Antillogorgia bipinnata&lt;/em&gt; changed the size of its branches up to ten times from shallow-water down to 40 m at the Belize barrier reef but no genetic differentiation was found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;9&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8892 alignright&quot; height=&quot;277&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/9-300x224.png&quot; width=&quot;371&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors since then were wondering what was the limit of such plasticity, the adaptive canvas and if that such shape transformation can lead to an isolated population at the extremes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marine scientists studying biodiversity in the tropics are always amazed by the great number of species living in the same environments. It is difficult to image a process leading to species diversification without geographic barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists like Calixto and Sánchez are betting on plasticity as the first step to speciation without geographic barriers only with some type of selective effects at the extremes. They are now tracking the footsteps of selection in the genome of the species and the effects of depth on the coral reproductive synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officially at least, last week’s global &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marchforscience.com&quot;&gt;March for Science&lt;/a&gt; was politically neutral. However, there’s a massive over-representation of people with liberal, left-leaning views in science, and much of the science community is unhappy, to put it mildly, with the way politics is going, such as the Trump administration’s proposed deep cuts to science funding, and here in the UK, the impact of Brexit on British science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against the backdrop of these anxieties, many of the banners on display – such as “Alternative hypotheses, not alternative facts” and “Science reveals the truth” – conveyed a barely concealed message: if only right-wing conservatives could be a little more objective, less biased, more open-minded – you might say a little more “scientific” – then the world would be a better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of past psychology research lends some credence to this perspective: for instance conservatives tend to score lower on the trait of open-mindedness than liberals, and of course conservatives, more often than liberals, are sceptical toward the scientific consensus that human activity has had a significant impact on climate change. But it’s also easy to find psychological evidence of liberals’ bias, and liberals too are often in denial of unwelcome scientific theory, such as evolutionary accounts of sex differences in behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now two new articles, &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2952510&quot;&gt;published at the Social Science Research Network&lt;/a&gt; (SSRN) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103116304024&quot;&gt;in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, provide further compelling evidence that liberals, as much as conservatives, are prone to partisan bias – that is, showing rapid, easy acceptance of evidence that supports their existing beliefs – and that they are just as motivated to avoid hearing viewpoints that differ from their own. Whether we’re liberal or conservative, a first step toward combating our political prejudices, the paper in SSRN concludes, is “to recognize our collective vulnerability to perceiving the world in ways that validate our political beliefs”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-22950&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That paper in SSRN is a meta-analysis that combined the results of 41 previous experimental studies into partisan bias, collectively involving over 12,000 participants self-categorized as either liberal or conservative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the included studies followed a similar format: participants rated the credibility of evidence, such as a survey, experiment or op-ed, which either supported or contradicted their existing beliefs, such as on gun ownership or affirmative action. By holding the quality of the evidence and methods the same, but altering whether it supposedly came up with data supporting or contradicting participants’ viewpoints, this kind of research is able to reveal partisan bias – that is, whether participants’ are less sceptical and discerning when confronted with evidence that backs their own views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the combined data from all these studies, Peter Ditto at University of California, Irvine, and his colleagues, found that liberals were as prone to partisan bias as conservatives. What’s more, partisan bias on all sides was especially on display when participants were presented with scientific data, perhaps undermining the chants of the science march: that it might be easier to reach political consensus if we could all agree to just stick to the facts. As Ditto and his team put it, “the prognosis for eradicating partisan bias with harder data and better education does not seem particularly rosy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other new paper, led by Jeremy Frimer at the University of Winnipeg, used five studies to test American and Canadian participants’ motivation to encounter viewpoints different from their own. For instance, the first study offered participants more money to read an essay that contradicted their own views on same-sex marriage. The researchers found that equally among liberals and conservatives, a majority of participants preferred to forego cash if that meant avoiding opposing views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other studies involving other topics, such as gun control, abortion and climate change, led to similar results: liberals as much as conservatives were disinclined to hear the perspective of the other side. And the reasons they gave were similar: they thought hearing opposing views would make them feel uncomfortable or angry and harm their relationship with the source of the opposing views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The result of this desire to avoid ideological incongruous views is that liberals and conservatives live in ideological information bubbles, and what could ultimately be a contest of ideas is being replaced by two, non-interacting monopolies,” Frimer and his colleagues concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new research has some short-comings and shouldn’t be seen as the last word. It’s obviously North-American centric, and it’s not clear how much the results would apply in other parts of the world. It’s also extremely difficult to separate the moral dimension from psychology research into politics: for instance, how to deal with the potential argument that avoiding exposure to some opinions actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; more justified than avoiding exposure to others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So of course more careful research is required, into ways that liberals and conservatives are similar and different. But if these new studies help us recognise that we all, no matter our political colours, could work harder to be more open-minded of opposing viewpoints, then this is surely constructive. As Sean Blanda put it in a &lt;em&gt;Medium&lt;/em&gt; essay last year “&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@SeanBlanda/the-other-side-is-not-dumb-2670c1294063&quot;&gt;The other side is not dumb&lt;/a&gt;“; well, probably no more than your side anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Last year, a researcher cast doubt on a bone scientist’s clinical trials, suggesting some of the findings may not be legitimate. So what’s happened since? Since 2015, journals have retracted 14 papers by bone researcher Yoshihiro Sato, based at Mitate Hospital in Japan, for issues ranging from self-plagiarism, to problems with data, to including co-authors without their consent.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Black rat&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Picture1_Blackrat_Ernie_Janes-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many ecosystems today are threatened by invasive species. These newcomers prey on or compete with native species, they carry new parasites and diseases, and even cause extinctions of long-established residents. But why are some species such successful invaders while the advances of other species in foreign territory remain unrecognized?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, we focused on one of the most pervasive examples of invasive species: rats. These rodents are found nearly everywhere on the planet and are known for having detrimental effects on native ecological communities, particularly on islands. As part of his PhD thesis Toky Randriamoria from the University of Antananarivo spent many months in central eastern Madagascar to catch small mammals. Rats were what he mainly found in his traps, in agricultural fields, close to villages, and in natural forests alike. Originally introduced by Seafarers from the Arabian Peninsula in the Middle Ages, black and Norway rats have overrun Madagascar. Today, they occur in virtually all natural and anthropogenic habitats on the island, representing &amp;gt;95% of rodent captures in certain areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8897&quot; style=&quot;width: 1034px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Capturing black rats –a trap in a rice field &quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8897&quot; height=&quot;680&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Picture2_Trap-in-rice-field.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Capturing black rats –a trap in a rice field&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Toky M. Randriamoria&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toky collected nearly 600 hair samples of black and Norway rats, which I used to encipher the diet and habitat use of these individuals by stable isotope analysis. Stable isotopes are “one of nature’s ecological recorders” and integrate information on what and where an individual fed during the period of hair growth. We found that rats mixed animal and plant matter and had an extremely broad dietary niche. Indeed, rats covered a dietary niche that was larger than a whole community of around 20 native species! Moreover, rats were opportunistic foragers and changed their diet according to what was available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we learnt even more from stable isotope analysis: the signature of some individuals did not match to their habitat. This can only mean that certain individuals move between agricultural fields near villages and natural forests; and with them their parasites and diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus overall, our results suggest that due to their flexible and generalist diet and potential movement between natural forest and anthropogenic habitats, rats might affect native forest-dependent Malagasy rodents as competitors, predators, and disease vectors. The combination of these effects helps explain the invasion success of rats and the detrimental effects of this genus on the endemic fauna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A prominent diabetes researcher based at Harvard Medical School has retracted a third paper, citing manipulation of multiple figures. Late last year, Carl Ronald Kahn—also chief academic officer at Joslin Diabetes Center—retracted two papers for similar reasons. In November, Kahn pulled a 2005 paper from The Journal of Clinical Investigation (JCI) and a month later, he retracted a 2003 paper from The […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us tend to think we’re better than average: &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167211432763&quot;&gt;more competent, honest, talented and compassionate&lt;/a&gt;. The latest example of this kind of optimistic self-perception is the “invisibility cloak illusion”. In research &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/112/4/589/&quot;&gt;published recently&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, Erica Boothby and her colleagues show how we have a tendency to believe that we are incredibly socially observant ourselves, while those around us are less so. These assumptions combine to create the illusion that we observe others more than they observe us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-22918&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a first step, the researchers asked participants on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk survey website how much they usually observe other people. Participants indicated that they were more observant of others than they expected the average person to be, whilst they believed they were observed less than other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next the researchers asked students about their experience immediately after lunch in a university canteen. Participants rated themselves almost twice as observant of strangers in the canteen, as these other people were of them. When participants had been dining with friends, they said they had noticed more about their friends than their friends had of them. They also indicated that, when accidentally making eye contact with someone, they felt it was because they were already watching that person – not because they themselves were being watched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this provides initial support for the invisibility cloak bias, the researchers also wanted to test this experimentally. They set up a waiting room, where two student participants of the same sex believed they were waiting for the experiment to begin. The participants sat opposite each other for seven minutes, giving them the opportunity to watch one another. They were then taken to separate rooms and given the role of either observer or target (unbeknown to them, whichever role they were given, the other participant was allocated the other role) . The observer’s task was to write down everything they had noticed about the target, while the target’s task was to write down everything they believed the other person would have noticed about them. This process was repeated with multiple pairs of participants and there was a consistent mismatch, showing the invisibility cloak illusion in action: the observers tended to produce far more detailed notes about their fellow participant than the targets expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This illusion seems at odds with the “spotlight effect”, which you may recall from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3d2a/1c99395124bf9372e1493f314f6990a78473.pdf&quot;&gt;particularly cruel experiment&lt;/a&gt; published in 2000: participants were asked to wear a Barry Manilow t-shirt in public, and were convinced more people noticed it than actually had. To understand how the spotlight effect and the invisibility cloak illusion could coexist, the Boothby and her colleagues repeated the waiting room experiment. The only difference was some of the targets wore a t-shirt with a large image of the Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar on it. Targets wearing the t-shirt overestimated how noticeable it was to the observer, replicating the spotlight effect. However, this did not generalise beyond the t-shirt, as they didn’t suspect observers had noticed anything else about them. This shows that the two biases are not incompatible; one can be self-conscious about a particular aspect of themselves, while still believing they go less noticed on the whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms behind the invisibility cloak illusion seem fairly straightforward. We know we have lots of private thoughts about what we’ve noticed of other people, but we mistakenly overlook that most other people have these kind of private thoughts too. This is compounded by the fact that, when observing others, most of us are careful to be discreet –  looking away or pretending to be engrossed in something else – with the result that we rarely notice when other people are watching us. The researchers suggest that this illusion could even be beneficial as it helps us feel a sense of control, a theory that needs to be investigated further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need more research to test the robustness of this illusion, especially with older participants. If it does replicate, it may have important implications for our social interactions. For example, it suggests we are likely to underestimate the impact our actions have on others. Take emergency situations: we may look to others to see how they are reacting, while not realising that they in turn are taking their cues from us. It’s worth remembering that we are just as present, and visible, as everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, these new findings may be disconcerting for anyone who suffers from painful self-consciousness. But it’s worth remembering that people typically aren’t paying attention to what we’re self-conscious about. Moreover, being observed is not the same thing as being judged. Our own observations of others typically drift through our minds without us paying them much attention – in that regard, the part of the new research in which participants wrote down what they noticed about each other was a rather unnatural task. In real life, it’s likely these details would be forgotten quickly. Earlier, more comforting studies have also shown that other people tend to judge us far less harshly and with more empathy, even when we think we’ve embarrassed ourselves, than we expect.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease affects an estimated 5 million individuals in the US and causes a devastating loss of cognitive function due to the buildup of beta-amyloid and tau proteins in the brain. Previous efforts to combat this disease have focused on developing drugs that target beta-amyloid, but such treatments have been unsuccessful in patients so far. Several exciting new approaches for treating Alzheimer’s are currently being tested in clinical trials in the US and Europe. These trials will assess the efficacy of an anti-viral drug that is normally used to treat herpes, and a new vaccine that generates antibodies against tau protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease was first identified in 1906 and is the most common cause of dementia, responsible for an estimated 60–70 percent of dementia cases. Alzheimer’s predominantly affects the elderly, but approximately 5 percent of cases involve early-onset disease (prior to the age of 65). The predominant symptoms of Alzheimer’s are a loss of memory and other intellectual capacities, which must be severe enough to interfere with everyday functioning. Mood swings and behavioral difficulties are also predominant symptoms. As the disease progresses, motor functions can also be impacted, inhibiting the ability of patients to speak, swallow, and even walk. Affected individuals typically survive between 4–20 years beyond the time that their symptoms become noticeable to others, with an average survival time of 8 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research into the causes of Alzheimer’s has revealed that two proteins, beta-amyloid and tau, play a key role in disrupting the neural processes that underlie memory and other cognitive abilities. Beta-amyloid normally acts to combat oxidative stress, regulate cholesterol transport, and fight off bacteria in the brain. In Alzheimer’s, however, beta-amyloid is overproduced. The excess protein forms clumps, or plaques, around neurons that can interfere with the transmission of nerve impulses. Tau is found in abundance in neurons and normally acts to stabilize cell proteins called microtubules in neuronal axons. In Alzheimer’s disease, defective forms of tau are produced, often containing large numbers of attached phosphate groups, termed hyperphosphorylated tau. Defective tau fails to stabilize microtubules, and instead binds together into insoluble aggregates or “tangles” of protein. The buildup of these neurofibrillary tangles inside of neurons, combined with amyloid plaques surrounding neurons, disrupts cell-to-cell communication in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current therapies for Alzheimer’s include drugs that treat the symptoms of dementia by regulating neurotransmitter levels; however, none of these treatments directly addresses the cause of the disease. Research efforts have focused on finding a drug that can prevent the buildup of plaques by interfering with beta amyloid synthesis and aggregation. Unfortunately, despite promising preclinical data from animal studies, these drugs failed to produce results in humans or had devastating side effects. For example, one anti-beta-amyloid vaccine caused meningoencephalitis or inflammation of the brain tissue and surrounding membranes. This side effect may have resulted from the reaction of the vaccine with beta-amyloid normally present in the walls of blood vessels. Such serious side effects were cause for cessation of the trial, and researchers have subsequently turned their attention to other possible treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A research team led by Hugo Lövheim from the Department of Community Medicine and Rehabilitation and the Unit of Geriatric Medicine at Umeå University in Sweden is piloting the first clinical study to address the effect of a herpes virus drug on Alzheimer’s disease. Lövheim’s group previously showed that infection with herpes virus was correlated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. People who tested positive for antibodies associated with the reactivated form of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1 anti-IgM) had double the risk of developing Alzheimer’s. Thus, the researchers surmised that brain signaling pathways activated by the virus might trigger the disease, and conversely, that anti-viral drugs might reverse disease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VALZ-Pilot study is currently recruiting participants with Alzheimer’s to investigate the effects of Valaciclovir, sold by the brand name Valtrex, a drug typically prescribed to treat genital herpes, cold sores, and shingles. Thirty-six participants will receive four weeks of drug treatment. Markers in the spinal fluid will be examined to assess the effect of the drug on several Alzheimer’s disease parameters, including levels of tau protein. A subset of subjects will also undergo positive emission tomography (PET) brain imaging analysis. By using a tracer that accumulates in cells with active herpes infection, this methodology can potentially detect this infection in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second new approach for treating Alzheimer’s, spearheaded by Petr Novak and colleagues at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, is the generation of a vaccine that targets the tau protein. Previous vaccine treatments for Alzheimer’s, which have thus far proven unsuccessful, focused only on beta-amyloid. The new vaccine, AADvac1, will prompt the body to generate antibodies against tau. The production of anti-tau antibodies will hopefully direct the immune system to clear tau protein from inside brain cells, similar to the way it fights off viruses and bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing a tau vaccine wasn’t easy; tau is a protein also found in healthy brains, and thus the removal of “healthy tau” by a vaccine could have negative side effects. The researchers compared differences in the structure of the healthy and pathological tau proteins, and identified what they call the “Achilles heel” of the abnormal protein. They were then able to create a vaccine that recognizes this feature of the abnormal protein, yielding treatment specificity for the disease-causing tau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the AADvac1 vaccine is in phase 1 of clinical trials, which involves administration of the drug to healthy volunteers to assess side effects, but does not address efficacy. No serious side effects have been observed thus far, and volunteers have experienced only minor reactions at the injection site, similar to other types of vaccines. The lack of side effects is a promising first step. Moreover, the trial has also demonstrated the effectiveness of the drug to elicit an immune response, which is a critical factor for its success. These promising preliminary data provide much-needed hope for Alzheimer’s patients and their families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what, exactly, are NTDs? They are a diverse group of communicable diseases that flourish in tropical and subtropical conditions in 149 countries, costing developing economies billions of dollars every year, according to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (WHO). NTDs mainly affect populations living in poverty, without adequate sanitation and in close contact with infectious vectors, domestic animals and livestock. In addition to causing mortality, NTDs remain an impediment to poverty reduction and socioeconomic development (WHO). Approximately 1.2 billion people globally have their quality of life and economic productivity diminished by NTDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, however, there has been tremendous progress in the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/news/Global_resolve_to_end_NTDs_amid_unprecedented_progress/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;past five years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. “For some diseases we’re ahead of our 2020 targets,” says Dirk Engels, Director, WHO Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases. WHO, Uniting to Combat NTDs and the NTD community collaborated to host the recent 2017 NTD Summit celebrating the 5th year since the signing of the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://unitingtocombatntds.org/resource/london-declaration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;London Declaration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a collaborative disease eradication program inspired by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/70809/1/WHO_HTM_NTD_2012.1_eng.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO 2020 roadmap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to eradicate or negate transmission for at least ten NTDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partnering with summit organizers and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, &lt;em&gt;PLOS NTDs&lt;/em&gt; – on the occasion of its 10th anniversary – co-hosted a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://unitingtocombatntds.org/sci-research-fri-2pm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;panel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; at the summit with &lt;em&gt;PLOS NTDs&lt;/em&gt; co-Editor-in-Chief Peter Hotez and PLOS Executive Editor Veronique Kiermer as moderators. The panel brought together experts on lymphatic filariasis, soil-transmitted helminth infection and schistosomiasis, all who have been involved with the journal either as frequent contributors or editors. These leading scientists from the WHO Regional Director’s Office of Africa (drawing on expertise gained in Tanzania); the University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka; and the National Institute of Parasitic Diseases, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, People’s Republic of China participated in an engaging discussion of how providing access to publication – as a reader, author and editor – can help build capacity for research in disease-endemic countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in parallel with the panel, the Symposium article “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005530&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Partnering to Promote Research Where It Matters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” focuses on capacity-building efforts and the positive impact of Open Access scientific literature for those working in disease-endemic countries. In China, “We work together on issues like health education, behavior change, and communication skills,” says panelist Xiao-Nong Zhou, Director of the National Institute of Parasitic Diseases at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “Our university could only afford a very restricted number of titles,” says Nilanthi de Silva, parasitologist at the University of Kelaniya in Sri Lanka. &lt;em&gt;PLOS NTDs&lt;/em&gt; (and other Open Access journals publishing NTD-related research) offers an essential venue for researchers in low- and middle-income countries. Of the papers published to date, 25% have at least one author from Africa and 23% have an author from South America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible that nearly half of the current NTDs could be eliminated, eradicated or show significant gains in these directions &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/news/Global_resolve_to_end_NTDs_amid_unprecedented_progress/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;within the decade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. That would take continued dedication, and funding. “The last decade has seen a mixed picture when it comes to success stories in the progress to control or eliminate the world’s NTDs,” acknowledge &lt;em&gt;PLOS NTDs&lt;/em&gt; Editors-in-Chief Serap Aksoy and Peter Hotez. According to David Molyneux, Emeritus Professor Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and lead of their overarching Neglected Tropical Diseases program, “The future is going to be about building capacity for NTDs and recognizing that we’re talking about a broader problem of sustainable development.” Molyneux is a long-term editorial advisor for &lt;em&gt;PLOS NTDs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.plos.org/ntds-10th-anniversary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;10th Anniversary Collection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Editorial Board members and other experts examine this progress in 20 of the major NTDs over the last decade. Those familiar with these diseases, those wanting a comprehensive overview or those wanting to focus on a specific disease will find in the collection reflections on significant lessons and successes as well as remaining challenges. The collection lays out a roadmap for future research priorities and identifies key opportunities for further progress in disease elimination. The Editorial by Aksoy and Hotez, “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005355&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS NTDS: Ten Years of Progress in Neglected Tropical Disease Control and Elimination…More or Less&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt; provides an excellent introduction to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.plos.org/ntds-10th-anniversary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS NTDs Tenth Anniversary Collection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation &lt;em&gt;PLOS NTDs&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000077&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;founded&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to represent the needs of a community of scientists, public health experts and global advocates working on diseases of the poor and simultaneously to be a capacity-building tool for disease experts living and working in Africa and other disease-endemic regions of the world. Since founding, the journal has published over 4,700 articles (Research Articles, Editorials, Viewpoints, Policy Platforms, From Innovation to Application articles and more) written by more than 8,000 authors. Currently 40% of the journal’s 255 editorial board members are from disease-endemic countries. For more details of the journal’s history and impact over the past ten years, see the Editorial, “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005479&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases Decade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journal editors and staff have worked diligently on its dual mission to build capacity and encourage the submission and publication of the work of authors living and conducting research in disease-endemic countries. Editors have hosted 26 writing workshops in affected countries around the globe and provide training on best practices to ensure robust peer review, avoid plagiarism, handle data management and address other &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ori.hhs.gov/infographics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;issues of research integrity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. They also cover tips on crafting comments to authors and editing decision letters. These activities build a strong NTDs community to ensure ongoing success of the journal and scientific endeavors related to NTDs research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So bookmark the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/plosntds10&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;10th Anniversary landing page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, browse the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.plos.org/ntds-10th-anniversary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;10th Anniversary Collection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and celebrate 10 years of advancing research, policy and progress in combatting NTDs. There’s more work to be done!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 Class B G-protein-coupled receptors are major targets for the treatment of chronic diseases, such as osteoporosis, diabetes and obesity. Here we report the structure of a full-length class B receptor, the calcitonin receptor, in complex with peptide ligand and heterotrimeric Gαsβγ protein determined by Volta phase-plate single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The peptide agonist engages the receptor by binding to an extended hydrophobic pocket facilitated by the large outward movement of the extracellular ends of transmembrane helices 6 and 7. This conformation is accompanied by a 60° kink in helix 6 and a large outward movement of the intracellular end of this helix, opening the bundle to accommodate interactions with the α5-helix of Gαs. Also observed is an extended intracellular helix 8 that contributes to both receptor stability and functional G-protein coupling via an interaction with the Gβ subunit. This structure provides a new framework for understanding G-protein-coupled receptor function.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/04/Romano-1-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In women, a major role of prolactin is to initiate and sustain pregnancy and lactation. During pregnancy, prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland is important for pregnancy maintenance and prolactin levels are correlated with miscarriage occurrence. When prolactin levels fail to increase properly, there is a higher risk of miscarriage&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. But prolactin levels are also important during the female reproductive cycle – as increased prolactin secretion can cause infertility by inhibiting the release of hormones that trigger ovulation. So prolactin levels cannot be too high to allow ovulation and pregnancy to occur, but also have to increase at a proper rate during early pregnancy to ensure pregnancy success. But how the body carefully regulates prolactin in real time has been a mystery – until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulation of prolactin secretion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body controls its hormonal release by means of positive and negative feedback. In a general way, hormones secreted in the hypothalamus (area of the brain that controls the body’s homeostasis) stimulate the pituitary gland to secrete several hormones. These hormones enter the blood stream and act in peripheral target glands, stimulating further hormonal release (positive feedback). Subsequently, those hormones secreted by the target glands reach back to where the process started, suppressing hormonal secretion in both hypothalamus and pituitary (negative feedback). Like your home thermostat, sensing when your house is getting too warm, and turning on the air conditioner. Once the optimal temperature is reached, the air conditioner is turned back off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But prolactin is different. It lacks a target peripheral gland, and therefore is not regulated through the standard negative feedback mechanisms that resemble your thermostat. Unlike other pituitary hormones that are stimulated by the hypothalamus, prolactin secretion is controlled by inhibitory dopaminergic inputs, produced in the tuberoinfundibular region of the hypothalamus (TIDA). We know that dopamine inhibits prolactin (and prolactin in turn, stimulates dopamine), but we do not know the temporal relationship among these players. The activity of dopaminergic neurons is very fast, firing in bursts of spikes happening at 20 seconds intervals&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Prolactin response, in turn, occurs in a much slower way. So how does all this rapid activity of dopaminergic neurons translate into dopamine release at the median eminence and subsequent (slower) prolactin secretion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent study published in PNAS, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/114/9/2379.abstract&quot;&gt;Romano and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; used an innovative new approach to investigate real time interaction between dopamine and prolactin. The researchers were able to measure dopaminergic release from TIDA neurons, correlating it to prolactin levels in freely moving mice, in real time, for several days! They implanted several miniaturized carbon fibers directly into the median eminence of female mice. This area is the part of the hypothalamus where the hormones are released, being the connection between brain and pituitary gland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_19315&quot; style=&quot;width: 480px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/04/Romano-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-19315&quot; height=&quot;307&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/04/Romano-1-300x192.jpg&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This figure show how TIDA neurons release dopamine at the level of the median eminence.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a hierarchical relationship between different dopaminergic neurons &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By analyzing dopaminergic secretion over several days, the authors found that dopamine release was more frequent during the night, and that periods of intense dopaminergic activity were always followed by periods of silence. This makes sense within the feedback nature of the neuroendocrinology system, where hormones are released in pulses, to prevent down-regulation of target receptors. Elevated constant hormonal levels results in a decrease in the quantity of the hormone receptor, resulting in decreased sensitivity (down-regulation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing dopaminergic currents on the basis of their shape, the authors realized that the dopaminergic neurons are stereotypically organized in distinct groups, with different and specific firing rates. These stereotypical features of the dopaminergic neurons were consistent between different animals and different days of recording.  When dual-carbon fiber recordings were performed in two distinct dopaminergic neurons 500 μm from each other, the authors discovered that dopaminergic firing events were coordinated within minutes during most of the recordings. Therefore, the activity from all those different TIDA groups is somehow coordinated over a range of minutes before dopaminergic release in the median eminence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Novel integrated view of how dopamine controls prolactin secretion &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although all TIDA neurons release dopamine in the median eminence, there are different subsets of TIDA neurons, with similar firing patterns among the members of the same group, but not coordinated with other groups (those different TIDA groups are shown in the figure as green, orange, and magenta). Each one of those groups of TIDA neurons follows a stereotyped sequence of events. Meaning that locally, there is an organization of frequencies and the firing events occur as sequences (Short-term interaction). Those local dopaminergic patterns are fine-tuned within pre-established time windows, being totally integrated in the median eminence, before actual dopaminergic release (Long-term interaction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of hierarchical organization of rhythmic activity has been previously seen in several other brain regions, and evolutionarily preserved among several species&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This repetitive rhythmic neural activity generates neural oscillations, which can vary in magnitude and/or frequency. In brain regions with hierarchical organization, several different neuronal oscillators form a linear progression, with slower oscillations regulating the amplitude (size) of the faster ones. This serves as a mechanism to transfer information from large-scale brain networks to the fast, and local cortical, integrating functional systems across multiple spatial and time scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time that a study has been capable to show that the median eminence is capable of integrating hierarchical neuronal oscillating networks, in a specific spatio-temporal pattern. This study opens a whole new path to investigate how hormonal rhythms can occur on multiple time-scales, ranging from minutes and days to seasons, helping to explain slow endocrine events such as reproduction, growth, metabolism, and stress.&lt;/p&gt;

 A new article posted on preprint site bioRxiv has generated a lot of interest among neuroscientists on Twitter. The article reports the existence of 'functional connectivity' between surgically disconnected distant brain regions using fMRI, something that in theory shouldn't be possible.

This is big news, if true, because it suggests that fMRI functional connectivity isn't entirely a reflection of actual signalling between brain areas. Rather, something else must be able to produce connectivi</content>

		<updated>2017-04-21T15:20:42+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease that affects more than 10 million people worldwide. The disease primarily results from selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta part of the brain. Its key clinical features include motor symptoms of rigidity, tremor, and bradykinesia. However, recent findings have confirmed that the disease is also characterized by its non-motor symptoms that appear before the onset of motor symptoms, strongly suggesting that Parkinson’s disease is not motor-specific. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pre-motor phase is mainly characterized by olfactory abnormality, rapid eye movement behavior, and constipation. In addition, the patient may also experience somnolence, apathy, and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the disease is not curable, currently available treatments alleviate symptoms, improve the quality of life and prolong survival. This article aims to review some of the recent developments that can make a difference to the patient’s quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Levodopa: the long-time gold standard for PD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, levodopa (a dopamine precursor) has been considered as the most effective drug for controlling both motor and non-motor symptoms. Hence, it is regarded as the long-time gold standard for treating PD. However, as the disease progresses (4–5 years after the onset), the ability of the drug to smooth out symptoms declines, and the patients start to experience motor fluctuations and dyskinesia, i.e., excessive involuntary abnormal movements. The motor fluctuations shift between ON-time, a state when the drug is effective and symptoms are controlled, and OFF-time, a period during which control of symptoms is lost. To overcome this limitation, levodopa is usually combined with a decarboxylase inhibitor like carbidopa to diminish rapid metabolism of levodopa in the periphery and thereby increase its availability for uptake into the brain. Recent research has further improved this add-on therapy to levodopa (i.e., levodopa/carbidopa) to provide sustained-release of levodopa and thereby improve motor fluctuations in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New adjunct therapy to levodopa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, a novel extended-release formulation of levodopa/carbidopa has been introduced in the US market with the name IPX066. This newly designed formulation features both the immediate and extended release properties of carbidopa/levodopa, thus it allows for both immediate and longer duration clinical benefits. IPX066 pills can be taken orally and are recommended for all PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two clinical trials, the efficacy of IPX066 was tested in both early and advanced PD patients. In these patients, the administration of IPX066 significantly reduced the OFF-time and increased the ON-time without causing dyskinesia.  No serious drug-related adverse effects were reported, although some patients experienced nausea, headache, dizziness, and insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concurrently, another novel improved formulation of levodopa is XP21279. This drug is not available on the market as it is still in the earlier phases of clinical development. The XP21279 is a levodopa prodrug that is readily absorbed in the small intestine where it is metabolized into levodopa. The levodopa then enters the plasma and transfers into the brain. The efficacy of XP21279 was tested in a clinical trial conducted on 14 PD patients with motor fluctuations. Out of 10 patients who completed the study, 6 patients showed a 30% reduction in OFF-time, whereas ON-time was not affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opicapone (trade name ONgentys®) is another novel drug that is used as adjunctive therapy to levodopa/carbidopa for mitigating motor complications in patients with PD. The drug was approved by the European Commission in July 2016. This is a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor that acts by blocking an enzyme that metabolizes levodopa, enhancing its efficacy and thereby significantly improving motor fluctuations. Unlike other COMT inhibitors such as tolcapone and entacaopne, opicapone is not associated with liver toxicity, as confirmed by experimental studies in animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of opicapone as adjunctive therapy to levodopa was investigated in two clinical trials: i) 14- to 15-week, double-blind, multinational trial; and ii) 1-year, open-label extension study in the same patients. The results were promising. Administration of opicapone (50 mg/day) caused a significant improvement in motor fluctuations in patients during the double blind trials. The opicapone-mediated improvements in motor fluctuations were maintained in the 1-year extension study. There were few reports of dyskinesia and decreased drug effects along with other common adverse effects, such as constipation, insomnia, and dry mouth, showed no drug relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safinamide, a highly selective MAO-B inhibitor, has been newly introduced as an add-on therapy to levodopa in mid-to-late-stage PD. The efficacy of safinamide as an adjunct to levodopa was tested in clinical trials of 6 months, 8 months, and 2 years, on middle to advanced-stage PD patients with motor fluctuations. The intake of safinamide (50–100 mg daily) in these patients had drastically increased ON-time without increased dyskinesia. The beneficial effect of increased ON-time was maintained in both 18 month and 2 year extension studies. In addition, the use of safinamide in these patients improved daily living, depression, clinical status, and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to levodopa, safinamide is also used as an add-on therapy to dopaminergic agonists in early-stage PD. Administration of safinamide at a dose of 100–200 mg/day was found as an effective PD therapy in combination with dopaminergic agonists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we still have no cure for Parkinson’s disease, recent developments have helped to improve symptomatic therapy, allowing patients to experience a better quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;© jarun011 / Fotolia&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Fotolia-Hemophilia-positive-jarun011-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bleeding disorders often arise when there is a problem with the clotting process. Hemostasis is the process by which the body arrests bleeding via the damaged blood vessels and it involves three major steps: vasoconstriction, formation of a temporary blockage (platelet plug), and blood coagulation. When injury causes a blood vessel to bleed, vascular constriction limits the flow of blood to the injured area. The vessel wall injury, via a series of reactions, triggers the attachment and activation of platelets which aggregates at the site of injury. Platelets adhere to collagen which becomes exposed in the endothelial cell lining of blood vessels at the site of injury creating the platelet plug. Initial platelet adhesion is to von Willebrand factor, a major component in the blood coagulation process. Coagulation factor VIII circulates in the blood stream in an inactive form when bound to von Willebrand factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8866&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;© science photo / Fotolia&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8866&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Fotolia_69426835_Subscription_Yearly_XXL.jpg-smaller-300x240.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;© science photo / Fotolia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When injury to a blood vessel occurs, factor VIII becomes activated and separates from von Willebrand factor and interacts with factor IX, another coagulation factor. This interaction sets off a chain of additional chemical reactions that form a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/F8&quot;&gt;blood clot&lt;/a&gt;. Activation of a sequence of blood clotting factors generates thrombin which converts fibrinogen to fibrin. Fibrin mesh is then produced around the hemostatic plug in turn strengthening the clot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;von Willebrand disease is the most common type of bleeding disorder and is &lt;a href=&quot;http://elearning.wfh.org/elearning-centres/vwd/#what_is_von_willebrand_disease&quot;&gt;usually less severe&lt;/a&gt; in comparison to other bleeding disorders. It occurs due to decrease in or malfunctioning von Willebrand factor activity which ultimately affects the hemostasis process and slows the formation of blood clots resulting in prolonged bleeding episodes. It is estimated that around 1% of the world’s population is affected by von Willebrand disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder where the blood is unable to clot properly. It can lead to spontaneous bleeding as well as bleeding after injury or surgery. Those who suffer from hemophilia can bleed longer than usual, although &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wfh.org/en/page.aspx?pid=646&quot;&gt;not faster&lt;/a&gt;. There are two main types of hemophilia which are hemophilia A and hemophilia B with the former being the most common of the two. Although it is the most common type of hemophilia, it is a rare condition and it affects about &lt;a href=&quot;http://haemophilia.org.uk/bleeding-disorders/haemophilia-a/&quot;&gt;one in every 10,000 males&lt;/a&gt; whilst hemophilia B affects &lt;a href=&quot;http://haemophilia.org.uk/bleeding-disorders/haemophilia-b/&quot;&gt;one in every 50,000 males&lt;/a&gt;. The condition arises when a mutation or change occurs in one of the genes that provide instructions for making the clotting factor proteins needed to form a blood clot thus resulting in reduced production or deficiency of the respective clotting factor. The F8 gene and F9 gene, both situated on the X-chromosome, provides the instructions for producing coagulation factors VIII and IX respectively. A mutation in the F8 gene causes hemophilia A whilst a mutation in the F9 gene results in hemophilia B. Suffers therefore have low levels of either clotting factor VIII or IX and the severity is determined by the level of the factor in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8867&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;iStockPhoto&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8867&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Chromosome-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;iStockPhoto&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the sex-linkage of the disorder, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/genomics/public/geneticdiseases/en/index2.html#Haemophilia&quot;&gt;prominence&lt;/a&gt; amongst male is greater than in females. Although the disorder mainly affects males, females can be carriers of the affected gene and experience symptoms. Hemophilia is a hereditary bleeding disorder. However, it has been found that in about a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/genomics/public/geneticdiseases/en/index2.html#Haemophilia&quot;&gt;third&lt;/a&gt; of new diagnoses there is no previous family history. This could be due to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/hemophilia/types-of-hemophilia.php&quot;&gt;new or spontaneous genetic mutations&lt;/a&gt;. It is estimated that worldwide, around 400,000 people are living with hemophilia with 20,000 of these cases present in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hemophiliafed.org/bleeding-disorders/hemophilia/&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and around 6,000 in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/genomics/public/geneticdiseases/en/index2.html#Haemophilia&quot;&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. Main symptoms can include a prolonged bleeding from cuts, a tendency to bruise easily especially in early childhood, and bleeding into joints and muscles causing pain, swelling, and stiffness which can result in joint deformity and limitation of movement if left untreated. Women can experience prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://elearning.wfh.org/elearning-centres/carriers-and-women-with-hemophilia/#carriers_bleeding_symptoms&quot;&gt;excessive blood loss&lt;/a&gt; can lead to anemia resulting in weakness and fatigue. In general, during the process of ovulation, women can develop simple/ functional ovarian cysts which are small and not usually problematic. However, it has been found that carriers of hemophilia are more likely to experience significant bleeding during ovulation and have a greater risk of bleeding into these simple cysts which then become &lt;a href=&quot;http://elearning.wfh.org/elearning-centres/carriers-and-women-with-hemophilia/#carriers_bleeding_symptoms&quot;&gt;hemorrhagic ovarian cysts&lt;/a&gt; that can cause considerable pain and may require urgent medical intervention. Women with hemophilia are also more likely to have postpartum bleeding following &lt;a href=&quot;http://elearning.wfh.org/elearning-centres/carriers-and-women-with-hemophilia/#carriers_bleeding_symptoms&quot;&gt;childbirth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been reported that of the 400,000 people living with hemophilia worldwide, only around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wfh.org/en/page.aspx?pid=642&quot;&gt;25%&lt;/a&gt; receive adequate treatment. The recommended treatment plan for hemophilia depends on the severity of the condition. The main treatment for hemophilia is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hemophilia/treatment&quot;&gt;replacement therapy&lt;/a&gt; whereby the missing clotting factor is slowly dripped or injected into a vein. A CDC- sponsored &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa067659#t=article&quot;&gt;randomised clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; found that regular treatment to prevent bleeding (prophylaxis with recombinant factor VIII) was effective in preventing joint damage and decreased the frequency of joint and other hemorrhages in young boys with severe hemophilia. The children who were treated on a regular basis also had less evidence of joint damage by 6 years of age than did those who were treated after a bleed had commenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8865&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;© curlymary / Fotolia&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8865&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Fotolia-Medic-with-tube-of-blood-takes-a-blood-test.-World-hemophilia-day-curlymary-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;© curlymary / Fotolia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, factor replacement therapy has its limitations as it has been found that approximately &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchematol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12878-014-0019-8&quot;&gt;25–30%&lt;/a&gt; of people with severe hemophilia A and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3934290/&quot;&gt;1–5%&lt;/a&gt; of people with severe hemophilia B develop an antibody (inhibitor) to the treatment which causes major complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of new therapies under development which include gene therapy where researchers are investigating means by which the faulty genes that cause bleeding disorders such as hemophilia can be corrected. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hemophilia/research.html&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; is also being conducted to design and implement interventions that will help combat complications. Although there is no cure for hemophilia, with the right treatment, care, and lifestyle changes, those who suffer from hemophilia can lead fulfilled lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;Word Cloud(1)&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Word-Cloud1-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rheumatology is a branch of medicine that is mainly concerned with disorders of joints, soft tissues, autoimmune diseases, vasculitis, and heritable connective tissue disorders – collectively known as rheumatic diseases. As these disorders generally involve inflammation/the immune system, rheumatology is generally seen as increasingly moving in the direction of autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common, and therefore well studied, rheumatic diseases are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, which cause pain and inflammation of joints and affect approximately 8.5 million people in the UK alone. However, these two conditions are just a couple of examples of rheumatic diseases as this umbrella term incorporates over 200 disorders. As illustrated in the figure above, these include conditions such as giant cell arteritis, fibromyalgia, Sjögren’s syndrome, sarcoidosis, gout and lupus, to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the nature of these conditions, they are often referred to as systematic and inflammatory rheumatic diseases. In addition to the burden of the rheumatic diseases themselves, it is now becoming clear that there are an increasing number of co-morbidities associated with rheumatic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, malignancies and infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is upon this background that &lt;em&gt;BMC Rheumatology&lt;/em&gt; is being launched to provide the rheumatology community with an open access avenue to disseminate research findings into these diseases with the ultimate aim of improving patient care. As a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt;, the ethos of &lt;em&gt;BMC Rheumatology&lt;/em&gt; will be &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/12/05/vital-importance-inclusive/&quot;&gt;open and inclusive&lt;/a&gt;, and the Journal will not make editorial decisions on the basis of the interest of a study or its likely impact. Like other journals in the &lt;em&gt;BMC &lt;/em&gt;series, submissions will be rigorously peer reviewed to assess scientific validity. Furthermore, as an open access peer-reviewed journal, published articles will be freely available to all readers whatever their location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/about&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Rheumatology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will be to consider research on all aspects of the prevention, treatment and management of rheumatic diseases, including osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, but the Journal will place a special emphasis on systemic and inflammatory conditions and connective tissue diseases, along with related co-morbidities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Rheumatology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will complement and expand the open access journal portfolio within the area of rheumatology at BioMed Central and will be a sister journal to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;em&gt;BMC&lt;/em&gt; series. Although there is some overlap in scope, &lt;em&gt;BMC Rheumatology&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders&lt;/em&gt; will sit very comfortably alongside each other: &lt;em&gt;BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders&lt;/em&gt; will have a focus on studies with a definite musculoskeletal component (i.e. bone, cartilage, tendon etc.), whereas &lt;em&gt;BMC Rheumatology&lt;/em&gt; will cover all areas of rheumatology, including systemic conditions and related co-morbidities, which are topics that will fall outside the scope of &lt;em&gt;BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To encompass the spectrum of rheumatology research, &lt;em&gt;BMC Rheumatology&lt;/em&gt; will be supported by an international &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board&quot;&gt;Editorial Board&lt;/a&gt;, with oversight from three expert Section Editors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘Clinical rheumatology’ edited by Susan Goodman (Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, USA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘Epidemiology and public health’ section edited by Edward Roddy (Keele University, UK)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘Pre-clincial and translational science’ edited by Alessia Alunno (University of Perugia, Italy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Section Editors will be pleased to consider papers on all aspects of rheumatology across a variety of article types, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/research-article&quot;&gt;Research articles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/case-report&quot;&gt;Case reports&lt;/a&gt;, as well &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/study-protocol&quot;&gt;Study protocols&lt;/a&gt; for proposed or ongoing prospective clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not submit your next paper to the journal? &lt;em&gt;BMC Rheumatology&lt;/em&gt; will have its launch issue in November 2017, so submit now and be part of the journal’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to know more about the journal, please do contact me, the journal’s Editor, by email (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:james.mockridge@biomedcentral.com&quot;&gt;james.mockridge@biomedcentral.com&lt;/a&gt;). I will also be attending &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eiseverywhere.com/ehome/174079&quot;&gt;Rheumatology 2017&lt;/a&gt; (25-27 April, Birmingham, UK) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.congress.eular.org/&quot;&gt;EULAR 2017&lt;/a&gt; (14-17 June, Madrid, Spain), and will be pleased to meet to discuss the journal further and answer any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you take from this hypothetical headline: “Reading the Research Digest blog is associated with higher intelligence”? How about this one: “Reading this blog might increase your intelligence”? According to science writing guides like &lt;a href=&quot;http://HealthNewsReview.org&quot;&gt;HealthNewsReview.org&lt;/a&gt;, taking the first correlational finding from a peer-reviewed article and reporting it for the public using the second wording, implying causation, is a sin of exaggeration, making a relationship appear more causal than the evidence suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet this happens a lot. A 2014 &lt;i&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;(BMJ)&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7015&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; showed these exaggerations to be rife in media coverage of correlational studies, with 81 per cent of news articles committing the sin. Dismayingly, one third of press releases were also guilty. These normally involve editorial input from professionals and often the scientists themselves, who should really know better. Reading about this, we might conclude that science communicators of all stripes need to get more familiar with the best practice of describing causality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the authors of that &lt;i&gt;BMJ&lt;/i&gt; analysis started to ponder whether readers interpret these headlines literally, or whether they draw their own conclusions. Now their research group has tested this for &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2016-52933-001/&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, and their findings suggest that while science writers need to pick up their game, science-writing guides also have some catching up to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-22882&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachel Adams and her colleagues at Cardiff University presented 71 online participants, average age 27, with real and modified headlines drawn from news stories about science, politics and sport. Take the following examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(A) Being breast fed makes children behave better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(B) Being breast fed is linked to better behaviour in children&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(C) Being breast fed is associated with better behaviour in children&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Style guides consider causal claims on a ladder, with a simple causal statement (A) at the top, ambiguous causal statements like (B) somewhere below, and (C) being on the bottom rung, as it makes a correlational rather than a causal claim. But when the participants reviewed a series of these kind of statements, rating in each case how much the initial term was causing the final one, a different picture emerged. While they gave the first type of headline high scores for causality at 75 or more out of 100, they scored headlines in the style of B and C similarly, at around the 50/100 mark, suggesting that they saw them both as suggesting a moderate amount of causality. This was true across all topics, and unaffected by the participants’ level of science education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In further experiments the researchers examined the effect of modifying a causal claim with a modal verbs – may, can, might and could – e.g. &lt;i&gt;Being breast fed may make children behave better&lt;/i&gt;. Modal verbs introduce some uncertainty, and the style guides recommend them when research demonstrates causality but the claim may not be watertight, such as when based on small or unusual samples. Participants’ interpretations suggested that they saw “can make” as a pretty strong statement, weaker than a pure causal statement but above all the others, such  as “might make” – much as style guides suggest. But whereas the style guides claim that “may make” is a stronger causal statement than equivalent headlines using “might” and “could”, participants saw these three modifiers as interchangeable and understood them to severely weaken the causal claim, rating them at, or even below, the causality of a purely correlational statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adams’ team concluded that readers do not have a highly sophisticated hierarchy of causality, but three broad categories: direct cause, can cause, and large bucket of moderate cause statements, including weaker modals, ambiguous statements, and even correlation itself. This evidence suggests we should be a bit more forgiving of press offices: re-analysing the &lt;i&gt;BMJ&lt;/i&gt; data from 2014 found that only one fifth of articles involved an exaggeration as defined in terms of how readers were likely to have interpreted them. Style guides may want to reconsider their recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final point: the research group also looked at the uptake of science coverage – how much a piece was read and shared – and found no evidence that exaggeration was of any benefit in increasing coverage. That’s heartening for science writers who prefer to focus on telling the truth in an engaging way rather than resorting to hype.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;An American alligator attacks an invasive Burmese python in Florida. Can the humble microbe help us predict which species will become successful invaders?&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Gator_and_Python-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current global changes impact all biota. There are those species that can utilize the changes and those that will have a hard time coping with the human induced changes. Invaders are among the winners and pose a serious threat to native species. Mitigation of the problems associated with invaders has sparked interest in predicting which type of invader species and genotypes could become invaders. However, invasion is always an interplay of the invader’s and resident community’s characteristics. Therefore one should remember that in the changing world anthropogenic change affects not only the invader but also community composition. Moreover, different areas are known to harbour different kinds of species assemblages. It is, thus, worthwhile to ask which kinds of communities could be more vulnerable to invasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s make it clear that this idea is by no means new. Many researchers since Charles Darwin and Charles S. Elton have done research on this subject: correlating species diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and relatedness between the community and the invader. Despite decades of work on invasions and coexistence mechanisms the evidence seems to be mixed, regardless of the study taxa and methodology. One thing, however, is rather clearly evident: more systems where key aspects of invasion theories can be manipulated are in demand, as from naturally occurring invasions it is hard to explicitly show the determinants of invasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-017-0126-z&quot;&gt;In our recent publication in &lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;we present a microbial system for the study of invasion theories, and use it to show that diversity in phylogenetic similarity between the invader and the community members (i.e. the closeness of their evolutionary relationships) affects invasion success. Those communities with diversity in phylogenetic distances to invaders resist invasions better than communities that are less diverse in their phylogenetic relationships to an invader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually a rather novel finding, as effects of diversity on invasions have been studied mostly at ecological level (species diversity), and not at the evolutionary level of phylogenetic diversity. Since invasion was explained by a metric that describes relatedness between the invader and the community our result casts a doubt on easy recognition of potential invaders, or vulnerable communities. Invader and community act together in the invasion process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blaah – microbes – you might think, close the link, and forget that lots of ecological and evolutionary theory has been created and tested with microbes. But, microbes invade as well, and knowing about microbial invasions of different habitats – lakes, pools, foods, teeth, wounds, and lungs – has direct implications for our day-to-day life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8840&quot; style=&quot;width: 2570px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Example of DNAse-agar plate used for recognizing invader species (Serratia marcescens) that produce red pigment and a halo around colonies. Other species used in the experiment can be seen as white colonies without a halo. &quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8840&quot; height=&quot;1536&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Invasion-blog.jpg&quot; width=&quot;2560&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Example of DNAse-agar plate used for recognizing invader species (&lt;em&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/em&gt;) that produce red pigment and a halo around colonies. Other species used in the experiment can be seen as white colonies without a halo.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Emmi Räsänen&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our experiments we used the opportunistic environmentally growing pathogen &lt;em&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/em&gt; as an invader. This species infects literally everything. For healthy humans, it is rather harmless, but it hosts range span from corals and plants to insects. Several species of insects, when infected, die within few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coolest thing in our system is that we can identify it from other bacteria with very simple agar plating. In addition to red pigment, &lt;em&gt;S. marcescens&lt;/em&gt; creates a halo around its colonies in DNAse agar plates, whereas other bacteria in our system are seen as white colonies without a halo. The other bacteria are traditional “lab rats” in microbiology like &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas species&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system can be used to test several key hypotheses concerning invasions; not only by manipulating species in the community but also their evolutionary background. Easily culturable bacteria can be put through experimental evolution with ease. Such new adapted genotypes can be used to create different invasion scenarios. For example mimicking anthropogenic change – and this is the direction where we are going to head next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least one in four readers of this post will die of cancer. This is a simple statistic that leads rationally thinking people to treat the possibility as very likely. And this is what many do: they try to adopt a lifestyle that minimises the risk to some degree. But how do we know what minimises and what increases this risk? Of course, by listening to experts, the best of whom are scientists who research these things. However, whenever there is disquiet brought about by uncertainty, self-titled experts come out of the woodwork. Discussion of factors increasing the risk of cancer is today not only the domain of medical doctors and psycho-oncologists, but is also engaged in by some alternative medicine proponents, pseudopsychologists, and fringe psychotherapists, whose opinions are disseminated by journalists, some more thorough than others (&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.pl/books/about/50_Great_Myths_of_Popular_Psychology.html?id=8DlS0gfO_QUC&amp;amp;redir_esc=y&quot;&gt;see myth #26 in &lt;em&gt;50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology&lt;/em&gt; for more background&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among these opinions is the common claim that negative thinking, pessimism, and stress create the conditions for the cells in our body to run amok, and for cancer to develop. Similar declarations accompany therapeutic propositions for changing our way of thinking into a more positive one that will protect us from cancer, or even cure us of the disease. Should you, therefore, begin to fear the possibility of cancer if you are not prone to optimism, or – even worse – have bouts of depression?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-22827&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pon.4084/abstract&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; published recently in &lt;em&gt;Psycho-Oncology&lt;/em&gt;, four Korean scholars have attempted to provide answers to this question by way of meta-analysis. The first difficulty they encountered was the heterogeneity of the assessment of depression in the published literature. To clarify the mixed findings, they limited data to articles that used a reliable method of defining depression based on criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and/or the International Classification of Disease (ICD). Only nine studies fulfilled their criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the results? Although some low-quality studies found that patients with depressive disorder were at increased risk for cancer, overall the meta-analysis did not demonstrate that patients with clinically diagnosed depressive disorder had an increased risk of developing cancer relative to the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So should readers with depressive tendencies breathe a sigh of relief? In the researchers’ cautious opinion, it is possible that some epidemiological biases affecting the diagnosis of depressive disorder or cancer could have affected their findings, thus concealing a depression-cancer link. Another limitation of their study was the narrow research database: most existing findings were obtained from Western societies and cannot be generalized to other cultures. Additionally, cancer detection depends on screening programmes and the application of new technologies, which vary across countries. Antidepressant medication is also a potential confounder for the relationship between depression and cancer. Furthermore, in the researchers’ opinion too much difference between studies causes a potential problem when interpreting the combined results. Finally, they think that possible publication bias may have affected their review, with negative results (a lack of an association between depression and cancer) less likely to see the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists write articles which are most often read by other scientists. The careful wording of conclusions is, in this context, essential. However, when cautious words of authors aware of the limitations facing their work are confronted with &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.pl/books/about/Smile_Or_Die.html?id=YLb1148-VWcC&amp;amp;redir_esc=y&quot;&gt;the arrogant declarations of healers and falsehoods spread via the Internet and other media&lt;/a&gt;, there is reason to fear that the former will be drowned out. The meta-analysis of the Korean scholars delivers data that are in agreement with a robust body of research. Many studies have shown that such factors as positive vs. negative attitudes, mood, emotions and stress have nothing to do with cancer (for example, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198568773.001.0001/acprof-9780198568773-chapter-28&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17955501&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18824713&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Moreover, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/331/7516/548&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15561987&quot;&gt;these studies&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated that the relationship could even be the reverse of what is expected: depressed people and those who experienced more stress were less likely to get cancer than those who were positive and did not suffer from stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conviction that positive thinking and emotions prevent the development of cancer, or can even cure it, is consistent with our need for control. We prefer to live with the conviction that we have control over something rather than it being out of our hands. Unfortunately, as a matter of fact, we are powerless to influence the overwhelming majority of cancer-inducing factors, and there are still others which simply remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;The Usambara Mountains in Tanzania, one of the many locations the researchers work took them too.&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/IMG_4772_rainbowsmall-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variation in environmental conditions across habitats has led to variation in life histories between species. To successfully reproduce and survive, an animal’s physiology, morphology and behaviour needs to be tuned to the environmental conditions of their habitat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, environmental variation along a latitudinal gradient has led to consistent differences in vertebrate life histories. In most vertebrates tropical species lead a slower pace of life than temperate vertebrates. This is especially well studied in birds where it has been shown that tropical birds usually lay smaller clutches of eggs, but live longer than temperate species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In temperate birds, the beginnings of each breeding season are challenging times for males. Upon arrival to their breeding grounds, they have to establish and defend a territory against other males. Once they have found a female that is willing to mate with them, she also has to be guarded against other males; especially during her fertile times just before egg-laying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Territorial defence behaviour and mate-guarding is facilitated by the sex steroid hormone testosterone in many vertebrates. Accordingly, blood samples from breeding males often reveal elevated testosterone levels at the beginning of the breeding season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, tropical birds are often resident and form life-long pair bonds with their mates. Is the breeding season for tropical males less challenging? Studies on testosterone levels of tropical birds have provided mixed results: while most tropical birds that have been tested so far have lower testosterone levels than usually measured in temperate ones, a number of tropical birds have now been found to have as high testosterone levels as their temperate counterparts. Do tropical species with high testosterone levels also have high levels of aggressive behaviour and song at the beginning of the breeding season?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8849&quot; style=&quot;width: 1290px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Male European stonechat&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8849&quot; height=&quot;854&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Stonechat_Saxicola_rubicola_male_Beaulieu_Hampshire.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Male European stonechat&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Charles J Sharp&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to their extensive breeding range from Siberia to Southern Africa, common stonechats (&lt;em&gt;Saxicola spp&lt;/em&gt;) are an excellent study system to determine whether testosterone, aggressive behaviour and song vary similarly during the breeding season at tropical and temperate latitudes. Tropical stonechats lay smaller clutches of eggs, have a longer lifespan and lower metabolic rates than their temperate conspecifics. They are residents and pair with their mates for life. Intriguingly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0018506X06001875&quot;&gt;a previous study&lt;/a&gt; found testosterone levels in Kenyan stonechats were as high as in German stonechats at the beginning of the breeding season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this hold true for other tropical stonechat populations? Are tropical male stonechats as aggressive and sing as much as temperate males? To find this out we sampled multiple populations in tropical East Africa and temperate West and Central Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our quest took us to Masai villages, to the rim of the Ngorongoro Crater, the steep hills of the Usambara and Pare mountains, to the grasslands of Kinangop, the gentle hills of the Ngong Hills and Ol Kalou and the slopes of Mount Meru and Mount Kenya in Tanzania and Kenya. In Europe it took us to grasslands and fields full of poppy below the impressive range of the Sierra Nevada and the medieval town of Ávila where we caught stonechats in the mountain ranges nearby. We went to the rugged, wild coast of the South of Ireland and to pastures in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8847&quot; style=&quot;width: 210px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Birds had blood samples taken to allow later analysis of their testosterone levels.&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8847 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Bird-handling-200x300.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Birds had blood samples taken to allow later analysis of testosterone levels.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer our questions we caught male stonechats with baited traps and took small blood samples from their wing veins. Later testosterone concentrations were quantified in the endocrinology laboratory of the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, Germany. We tested their aggressive response by placing a stuffed male stonechat into the centre of their territories and playing back stonechat song. We analysed their song performance by recording males early in the morning when they sing most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8846&quot; style=&quot;width: 210px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;By using this stuffed bird, combined with recorded songs, the researchers provoked aggressive responses from territorial males.&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8846 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Fake-bird-200x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;By using this stuffed bird, combined with recorded songs, the researchers provoked aggressive responses from territorial males.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Kim Mortega &amp;amp; Beate Apfelbeck&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that tropical and temperate stonechats indeed have very similar testosterone levels during the breeding season. We also found no differences in aggressive behaviour. Both tropical and temperate male stonechats had the highest testosterone levels when they were caught and tested during nest-building – the period of highest female fertility. In contrast, temperate stonechats were singing much more than tropical ones at the beginning of the breeding season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, despite their very different life histories, their variation in migratory behaviour and stability of pair bonds, life seems to be equally challenging for tropical and temperate stonechats at the beginning of the breeding season. In one important point the tropical and temperate environments of stonechats do not differ: both allow only for a short breeding season. In consequence stonechats probably breed relatively synchronously at all latitudes, which may increase the risk of being cheated during the fertile period of females. Males may therefore profit from high testosterone levels during nest-building to aggressively guard their mates from other rival males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, high song rates may be especially important for temperate males to attract a mate at the beginning of the breeding season and less so for tropical males that stay with their females year-round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, our study suggests that short breeding seasons may be a major selective force for high peak testosterone levels during breeding regardless of latitude and pace of life, but that particular behaviors, in our case song, can be uncoupled from peak testosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;

An introduction by featured PLOS ONE authors Shashwath Meda and Godfrey Pearlson follows, along with the most popular question and answer from their AMA, and a link to the entire discussion which took place today 4/19. –PLOSBLOGS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi Reddit,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Shashwath Meda and I am a Senior Clinical Research Associate at Olin Neuropsychiatry, Hartford Hospital/Institute of Living. I am also joined by Dr. Godfrey Pearlson who is the Director of Olin Neuropsychiatry and a Professor of Psychiatry at Yale University. A primary component of our research here at the center focuses on studying the effects of substance use on brain cognition and function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently published a study titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172213&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=ama&amp;amp;utm_campaign=reddit-ama-0417&quot;&gt;Longitudinal influence of alcohol and marijuana use on academic performance in college students&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. In this study, we evaluated the combined effects of alcohol and marijuana on academic GPA in 1142 freshman college students who were followed up longitudinally over a two-year time period. During this period, each month we collected data on their alcohol and marijuana use patterns while in college through a secure self-report website. In analyzing these data, we identified three substance-use groups, &lt;strong&gt;a)&lt;/strong&gt; a group that used either no or very low amounts of both alcohol and marijuana, &lt;strong&gt;b)&lt;/strong&gt; students that used no/low marijuana but medium-high amounts of alcohol and &lt;strong&gt;c)&lt;/strong&gt; students that consumed medium-high quantities of both substances. Interestingly, we found almost no one that consumed no-low alcohol but high amounts of marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings show that despite students having the same pre-baseline academic achievement as measured using the SAT scores, at the end of incoming semester those who heavily used either alcohol or alcohol+MJ had a significantly lower GPA compared to those who abstained or had very little of it. We also noticed that students who consumed fairly large quantities of alcohol alone (very little MJ) did not have a consistent decrease in GPA across the two-year period (we only noticed a significant decrease in GPA for the incoming semester). Finally, &lt;strong&gt;our follow up analysis suggested that those who moderated drug use over the period of the study could recover and perform better academically&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Shashwatch, thanks for doing this AMA it’s a great topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the elephant in the room for any of these sorts of longitudinal studies is 3rd variables. For instance, it’s quite easy to make an argument that there could be personality or emotional or experiential differences that make someone more likely to consume alcohol and marijuana but also likely to decline in achievement. Do you think this is indeed a causal relationship whereby the combination of alcohol and weed is affecting cognitive ability?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Author SM: Hello – Thanks for the question. What you say is absolutely possible, however as we explicitly indicate in our paper, the analysis that we did just wasn’t geared towards examining any causality. We tried to somewhat alleviate effects of intermediate variables by controlling for baseline measured personality and emotional traits. However to properly investigate what you allude to requires a causal modelling analysis such as SEM etc. We plan on doing this in the near future at least on the baseline variables to see what the data shows us. Again this is just the tip of the iceberg, much more to come in the future years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uni-regensburg.de/biologie-vorklinische-medizin/neurogenetik/&quot;&gt;Bj&lt;/a&gt;ö&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uni-regensburg.de/biologie-vorklinische-medizin/neurogenetik/&quot;&gt;rn Brembs&lt;/a&gt; is based a the University of Regensburg, Germany, where his group studies how brains generate spontaneous behavior, how they evaluate the sensory feedback from these actions and how different states of the animal influence the way these processes take place. He completed his PhD at the University of Würzburg, Germany and did a PostDoc in the Houston Health Science Center at the University of Texas, USA. Björn then spent a few years as an independent researcher at the Freie Universität in Berlin, Germany before becoming Adjunct Professor at the University of Leipzig. He finally joined the Institute of Zoology as a professor of neurogenetics of the University of Regensburg in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you first become interested in the neurobiology of behaviour?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was inclined to study science in general and biology in particular already in my high-school years. After spending much of my youth outdoors observing all kinds of animals in the wild I started reading scientific books by all kinds of scientists. In the late eighties, nonlinear dynamics were very popular (at the time known as “chaos theory”), I learned about relativity, was fascinated by Quantum Mechanics, and read books by Konrad Lorenz on animal behavior, by Rupert Riedl on evolution and many other biologists. My compulsory one-year project was on the homing behavior in salmons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was fascinated by big questions and thus broadly interested in the sciences, but the only area of biology I was sure I would never get into was neuroscience: I had read a book about the split-brain patients of Michael Gazzaniga’s, as well as Popper &amp;amp; Eccles’ book “the self and its brain”. I was captivated by the question of how our mind works, of whether we had free will and how we can know anything with any kind of certainty, but what I read in these books seemed so incomprehensibly complicated that I was sure it was way too complex for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my first undergraduate semesters I became particularly interested in developmental biology: how could a largely uniform zygote bring about a highly differentiated adult individual? However, just about the time when I started to realize that I found the actual work in this field mind-numbingly boring (seemingly endless pipetting of clear liquids into other clear liquids and then waiting for hours for a machine to complete its job), I attended the &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; neurogenetics lecture by Martin Heisenberg (youngest son of Werner of uncertainty principle fame) and was hooked! I learned that in this field, not only could I study the questions Gazzaniga, Eccles, Popper, etc. had been writing about, but that &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; may constitute an experimental system which at least would only make me feel dumb, incompetent and insufficient some of the time and not all the time. During this time, I also worked on a few projects in population and behavioral ecology. These areas also involved a lot of time spent with animals and sometimes their behavior, but the ecological and evolutionary aspects again seemed highly interesting but much more complex and intractable than I thought my limited intellectual capacity allowed me to master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I completed all Dr. Heisenberg’s department had to offer in terms of lectures and courses and I was even more thrilled by the work than initially. Eventually, Dr. Heisenberg became my thesis advisor and continues to be my mentor to this day. He became the first of three critical mentors who went above and beyond any ‘supervisor’ duties, supporting me at every step of the way. Without them I wouldn’t have stood a chance of survival in science. The research topic of the neurobiology of spontaneous behavior and how feedback modulates this spontaneity in operant learning situations fascinates me to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What challenges and developments can we expect to see for this field in the next few years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a scientist and not a prophet, so I find it difficult to make predictions, in particular about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general I think we are in the middle of a genuine paradigm shift in the neurosciences that probably started sometime in the early nineties. Until then, large sections of neuroscience operated under the impression that neurons, circuits and indeed entire nervous systems operated like the machines we engineer: passively receiving some input and generating output. The early work of the ethologists in the mid-late 20th century as well as later neurophysiological evidence from mollusks and other accessible animals contradicted this concept, but had little effect on the larger community, despite the Nobel Prize for Lorenz and the other ethologists. My thesis advisor, Martin Heisenberg, also contributed many contradicting experiments and provided cogent and evidence-based arguments without much effect. It probably was the converging flood of evidence from a variety of disparate fields around the turn of the century, not the least the discovery of resting-state network in the human brain, that started shifting peoples’ attitudes. In addition to the work in humans, ethological work showed that the kind of reproducible behavior neuroscientists love to study in the lab carry the risk of being exploited in the wild, raising issues about how generalizable any knowledge from this kind of behaviors is to other behaviors. Many new preparations were developed where experimentally isolated nervous systems (‘brain in a vat’) generated organized, ethologically relevant spontaneous activity in the absence of any sensory organs. Evolutionary work seemed to suggest that the ancestral functional organization of nervous systems was to generate activity first and have sensory input modulate that activity later. Perhaps most amusingly, basic neuroscience research that had started in the 1980s suddenly became medically relevant and hence subject to much more attention. That work had accumulated evidence over about two decades that even spinal reflexes (e.g., knee-jerk reflex) are far from the input-output systems most textbooks portray them as.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this evidence, together with ever more refined imaging capabilities of nervous system activity across the field, has led to a much more refined, almost reversed conceptual framework in neuroscience: now, nervous systems are increasingly conceptualized as constantly active, incessantly varying  this neural activity, with sensory stimuli exerting a modulating effect, the magnitude of which depends on the network state at which the stimulus arrives. As is so often the case in science, the most exciting new findings will probably come from experiments derived from this new perspective, experiments one could not have thought of from the old perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You joined &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;‘s editorial board when the journal was launched 10 years ago. What attracted you to &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; in the first place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, access seemed like such a huge issue. I hadn’t realized, yet, what other, larger issues loomed behind those paywalls. &lt;em&gt;PLOS&lt;/em&gt; in general and &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; in particular was a hip, new initiative. Supporting it helped me hit several birds with the same stone, two of which are: a) it enabled me to help push progress on publishing reform, both in terms of access and in terms of challenging journal rank. b) the work as an academic editor elevated my formal standing in the community and allowed me both to gather invaluable experience in the process of editing (crucial to the publication process) and to connect with colleagues in related fields I would otherwise not have been able to interact with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The journal has grown beyond expectations. Why do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; you think a journal like &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; – a multidisciplinary and&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; rigor-focused journal- is relevant to scientists in general and within&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; your field in particular?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are now several of such journals, they help to continue demonstrating to authors and readers that the concept of thematically arranged journals is antiquated. In the digital age, we have much better ways of channeling relevant information to readers than pre-selected information silos that build walls, not bridges between the different research objects. “Megajournals” are not overloading us with irrelevant information, as we only see what is relevant – although much of the process remains to be optimized and more current technology needs to be leveraged in this regard. Only few of these journals, e.g. F1000 Research, are still pushing any boundaries. For most, this once innovative form of publishing seems to now have become a cash cow from which profits need to be milked, rather than sandboxes to be widened and expanded to eventually provide an actual library where all scholarly content can be found: narrative, data and code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The publishing landscape has changed a lot in these 10 years. What do you think has been a positive change and where is there more work to do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, from my perspective, it has hardly changed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publishing is still dominated by the main publishers which keep increasing their profit margins, sucking the public teat dry,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of our work is still behind paywalls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You won’t get a job unless you publish in high ranking journals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher ranking journals still publish less reliable science, contributing to potential replication issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The increase in number of journals is still exponential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Libraries are still told by their faculty that subscriptions are important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The digital functionality of our literature is still laughable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no institutional solutions to sustainably archive and make accessible our narratives other than text, or our code or our data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only difference in the last few years really lies in the fraction of available articles, but that still remains a small minority, less than 30% total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the work we need to do is the same as it was at the time the subversive proposal was written, 23 years ago: getting rid of paywalls. This goal won’t be reached until all institutions have stopped renewing their subscriptions. As I don’t know of a single institution without subscriptions, that task remains just as big now as it was 23 years ago. Noticeable progress has only been on the margins and potentially in people’s heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you see the future of publishing? Are there any initiatives that you find particularly exciting or promising?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I’m not a prophet. If I had my way, I’d like to see institutions start dropping their subscriptions en masse and investing the money in a modern infrastructure, the sort of I have sketched out &lt;a href=&quot;http://bjoern.brembs.net/2015/04/what-should-a-modern-scientific-infrastructure-look-like&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently only see a few marginal initiatives or small groups of individuals starting to coalesce around this idea. Most larger or more well-known initiatives are still trying to care palliatively at for the symptoms, rather than attempting to cure the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/19/connection-between-brain-depression-and-effectiveness-of-chemotherapy/"/>
		<id>http://brainblogger.com/?p=22539</id>
		<updated>2017-04-19T15:25:48+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy is a type of therapy that uses various, rather aggressive, medicines to eliminate cancer cells from the body or slow down the growth of tumors. Cancer cells are different from normal cells as they reproduce a lot faster. Chemotherapy specifically targets the fast dividing cells and thus affects cancer cells the most. However, chemotherapy is a systemic therapy and therefore can be harmful for all other cells in the body. It has the largest negative effect on normal tissues that are quickly generated (e.g., blood cells, hair follicles, and sperm cells). Despite the disadvantages, chemotherapy remains one of the most important approaches to cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with the same type of cancer can react very differently to the same chemotherapy regiments. In some patients, chemotherapeutic drugs demonstrate much stronger effect on cancer cells, while in the others the tumor continues to grow unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of factors that influence the effectiveness and outcomes of chemotherapy is in the hundreds at least. Tumors of the same type are never exactly the same, as they might be caused by different mutations and influenced through different regulatory mechanisms and pathways. The individual sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents can also differ widely depending on the patient’s sensitivity to drugs, and their ability to metabolize them and remove the metabolites.  Chemotherapeutic agents rarely kill all cancer cells but they can weaken the disease and thus allow the natural immune response to cleanse the body of cancer cells. However, immune system strength can vary greatly and depends on the patient’s age, general health status and presence of other chronic diseases and comorbidities. Therefore, predicting the outcome of chemotherapy is never an exact science, and practitioners only compare treatments in terms of their statistical chances of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel studies have added a new dimension to the complexity of chemotherapy: it turns out that its success is also linked to the psychological state of patient’s brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago at the end of 2016, researchers from Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China, lead by Yufeng Wu, published results that claim that depression plays an important role in the effectiveness of chemotherapy. The study was conducted on 186 patients with small cell lung cancer who underwent chemotherapeutic treatment. The mental health status of patients and their depression level were evaluated before the beginning of treatment. Patients with more severe depression had a lot more side effects associated with chemotherapy and spent more time in hospital. It was noted that patients at later stages of cancer had more severe symptoms of depression. Also, the body mass index (BMI) played an important role in depression development in cancer patients. Patients with lower BMI experienced more severe depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was strongly linked with depression level. In patients with more severe depression, the level of a brain-derived neurotrophic factor was much lower than in patients with less severe depression. The results demonstrate that depression influences cancer prognosis by lowering the level of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BDNF reduces tissue sensitivity to chemotherapy medicines. This, in turn, reduces the effect of drugs on cancer cells. Thus, the level of BDNF indirectly influences how many tumor cells are killed by chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BDNF is a protein that can be found in human brain and peripheral nervous tissue. BDNF is known to increase the survival of neurons and peripheral neurons in the brain and induce the differentiation of new neurons. It also helps neurons to create new connections. BDNF plays one of the most important roles in the formation of long-term memory, and therefore plays an important role in the development of some diseases and chronic conditions such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, depression and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BDNF is reduced after extended periods of severe stress associated with high cortisone levels. Lower levels of BDNF cause atrophy of parts of the brain. In case of depression, degenerative processes in the hippocampus were reported. The long-term use of depression medication does protect the hippocampus from atrophy and thus helps in the management of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reported link between depression, BDNF level, and the effectiveness of chemotherapy certainly gives scientists some food for thought and may direct further research to investigate this phenomenon. It would be interesting to see if the BDNF level in cancer patients can be elevated by using antidepressants, and if this intervention can influence the outcomes of chemotherapeutic treatments. Potentially, treatment of depression may give cancer patients a better chance in fighting the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being optimistic about health was always considered helpful in fighting various illnesses. It appears that researchers have finally uncovered the actual molecular mechanism behind the will power.  The findings point out to the importance of paying attention to the mental state of patients, as depression may seriously reduce their chances of defeating cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

Historically Rome is a perfect place for such a conference as it was common for Romans to discuss official issues in a forum. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;tf=1&amp;amp;to=marco.sarchiapone@me.com&quot;&gt;Marco Sarchiapone&lt;/a&gt; (University of Molise, Italy and an Associate Editor for &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychiatry)&lt;/em&gt; was the main organizer and invited experts in suicide research from all over the world. Amongst others, important researchers including &lt;a href=&quot;http://ki.se/en/people/danwas&quot;&gt;Danuta Wassermann&lt;/a&gt; (Sweden), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gil_Zalsman&quot;&gt;Gil Zalsman&lt;/a&gt; (Israel), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zoltan_Rihmer/publications&quot;&gt;Zoltan Rihmer&lt;/a&gt; (Hungary), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychiatry.org/about-apa/meet-our-organization/board-of-trustees/maria-oquendo&quot;&gt;Maria Oquendo&lt;/a&gt; (USA) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.columbiapsychiatry.org/profile/jjmann&quot;&gt;John J. Mann&lt;/a&gt; (USA) presented and discussed new findings and their importance for patients suffering from suicidality. This conference was supported by the European Psychiatric Association and its Section “&lt;a href=&quot;https://suicidologysection.org/&quot;&gt;Suicidology and Suicide Prevention&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;From research to clinic&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8855 alignright&quot; height=&quot;199&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/From-research-to-clinic-300x199.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;The special atmosphere allowed a fruitful discussion of current research projects but also, and even more importantly, the clinical impact. As suicidality is one of the most complex phenomena in psychiatry a multilevel approach is needed for a better understanding and treatment. Biological perspectives, health care perspectives as well as public health issues were in the focus of the presentations. Young clinicians and researchers debated clinical cases in which one point became very clear: despite the guidelines and knowledge we currently have, the availability of local care and treatment options varies remarkably and sometimes makes it difficult for patients to receive the best care. Therefore suicide researchers and health care providers need to constantly raise awareness with political decision makers as this is crucial for supporting research activities and suicide prevention programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meeting was an exciting opportunity to meet senior suicide researches and discuss their work. Young researchers and trainees got the possibility to present results of their research within poster sessions. The next Roman Forum on Suicide will take place in 2018!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One 60-minute run can add 7 hours to your life” claimed &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt; last week. The story was based on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onlinepcd.com/article/S0033-0620(17)30048-8/fulltext&quot;&gt;new review&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases&lt;/em&gt; that concluded that runners live, on average, three years longer than non-runners and that running will do more for your longevity than any other form of exercise. But there’s more to running than its health-enhancing effects. Research published in recent years has shown that donning your trainers and pounding the hills or pavements changes your brain and mind in some intriguing ways, from increasing connectivity between key functional hubs, to helping you regulate your emotions. The precise effects sometimes vary according to whether you engage in intense sprints or long-distance running. Here, to coincide with a new feature article in &lt;em&gt;The Psychologist – &lt;/em&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-30/may-2017/minds-run-free&quot;&gt;Minds run free&lt;/a&gt;” – we provide a handy digest of the ways that running changes your mind and brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-22573&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running changes your brain wiring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
David Raichlen and his colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5147411/&quot;&gt;scanned the brains of young, competitive distance runners and controls&lt;/a&gt; while they rested in a scanner with their eyes open for six minutes. As reported in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Human Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, the runners showed greater connectivity between the so-called frontal parietal network and other neural regions involved in working memory and self-control, which the researchers interpreted as likely due to the cognitive demands of running and the runners’ increased aerobic fitness. The runners also showed greater “anti-correlation” between their default mode network (the DMN, which sparks into life when we’re resting) and a series of regions involved in motor control and sensation – the researchers said this could indicate that when on the move, the runners are likely to be very cognitively engaged, with their DMN suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intense sprints seem to boost your executive function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For a study published last year in &lt;em&gt;Preventive Medicine Reports&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4929070/&quot;&gt;researchers asked young volunteers (average age 12) to complete several 10-second sprints for ten minutes&lt;/a&gt; and then take some cognitive tests. The participants acted as their own controls and on another day (either before or after the sprint day) they completed the same mental tests after 10 minutes of rest. The participants’ performance on the Stroop Test – a long-established measure of mental control or what psychologists call “executive function” – seemed to be enhanced immediately after the sprints and 45 minutes afterwards, as compared with after resting. There were no effects of the sprints on visual-spatial memory performance or basic mental speed (as judged by the Digit Symbol Substitution test). Based on their finding of an apparent benefit of sprints on executive function, Simon Cooper and his colleagues said there was a case for including more opportunities for intense exercise in the school day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seven weeks of interval running training can boost your cognitive flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For three times per week for seven weeks, a small group of young dinghy sailors spent 45 minutes per session, rising to 90 minutes at the end of the programme, engaged in interval training: running fast for between 200 to 1000m, interspersed with periods of rest. The researchers tested their volunteers’ cognitive function before the training period and afterwards, and compared the outcomes with a control group of young dinghy sailors who just continued their active lifestyle as usual. &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2016/08000/Interval_Running_Training_Improves_Cognitive.4.aspx&quot;&gt;Writing in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research&lt;/em&gt;, Tomas Venckunas and his colleagues reported that the running group didn’t just get fitter and better at running, but also showed superior gains in their cognitive flexibility&lt;/a&gt;: that is, they were better at adapting to rapid switches in task instructions in a keypress task on a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ridiculously extreme long-distance running shrinks your brain (but it grows back)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 2009, 67 endurance athletes ran nearly 3,000 miles over 64 days, without a single day’s rest, to complete the TransEurope-FootRace ultramarathon. For a paper in &lt;em&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, a team of researchers led by Wolfgang Freund &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3566943/&quot;&gt;scanned the brains of a sample of these runners before the race, during and eight months afterwards&lt;/a&gt;. During the race, the runners’ brains shrunk, in terms of grey matter volume, by about six per cent, an amount that the researchers described as “substantial” considering that normal aging is associated with volume loss of around 0.2 per cent per year. However, at the final scan, the runners’ brains had recovered to their pre-race volume. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcsportsscimedrehabil.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2052-1847-6-4&quot;&gt;a follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation&lt;/em&gt;, the same research team pinpointed the running-related grey matter loss to four key areas, including parts of: temporoparietal cortex, occipitotemporal cortex, anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex, and caudate nucleus. Although highly speculative, they noted the overlap of these areas with the Default Mode Network and suggested the observed cell loss in these regions may reflect the combination of the metabolic demands of running combined with a prolonged lack of use of the DMN, the brain’s resting-state network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “runners’ high” may be linked to changes in brain chemicals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Completing a run can leave you feeling euphoric and several studies suggest this could be down to changes to the brain’s chemical messengers. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhn013&quot;&gt;a 2008 study in &lt;em&gt;Cerebral Cortex&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; used PET neuroimaging to show that a two-hour run led to enhanced opioid binding across several areas of the brain, as compared with before the run, and that this was associated with subjective feelings of euphoria. This supports the idea that running triggers the increased released of endorphins in the brain – a kind of natural high. &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1331&quot;&gt;A more recent paper in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed to the importance of other neurotransmitters: the researchers found that an intense treadmill run, but not a walk, was associated with increased circulation of endocannabinoids – endogenous brain chemicals that bind to the same receptors in the brain as cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running may quieten your mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Anecdotally, many runners also say that going for a jog has a calming effect, helping their brains dial back on usual levels of worry and rumination. A study published last year in &lt;em&gt;Experimental Brain Research&lt;/em&gt; appeared to provide some partial scientific support for this idea. Petra Wollseiffen and her colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-016-4587-7?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals&quot;&gt;used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the surface electrical activity of the brains of 11 ultramarathoners several times during a six hour run&lt;/a&gt;. Running was associated with reductions in activity in the frontal cortex of the brain, and for the first hour, runners also reported feeling more relaxed and an increased sense of “flow”. However, the levels of decreased brain activity and subjective feelings of flow didn’t correlate so it would be an oversimplification to say that this research shows that running helps you to relax by switching off your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running increases the growth of new neurons (at least in mice)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It was the received wisdom through most of the last century that adults can’t grow new neurons – a process called neurogenesis. It’s now known that this isn’t true: in fact, new neurons continue to grow through life in specific areas of the brain. Interest has turned to the function of these news neurons and ways to encourage their growth. To date, much of the research is on rats and mice, in whom a recurring finding is that running seems to encourage neurogenesis. Take &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v2/n3/full/nn0399_266.html&quot;&gt;a seminal paper published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; in 1999&lt;/a&gt;. Fred Gage and his team reported that mice who had the opportunity to choose to run in a spinning wheel exhibited twice the amount of neurogenesis in a part of the hippocampus (a brain region involved in memory and learning), as compared with mice who had no choice but to swim or others who had to complete a water maze. &lt;a href=&quot;https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/which-type-of-exercise-is-best-for-the-brain/?_r=0&quot;&gt;More recent animal research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that it is particularly long-distance running, as opposed to interval-style training (short bursts of running) that may increase neurogenesis, perhaps through release of what’s known as “brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)”, a chemical that encourages cell growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A short jog may help you regulate your emotions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For a 2015 study in &lt;em&gt;Cognition and Emotion&lt;/em&gt;, Emily Bernstein and Richard McNally &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2016.1168284&quot;&gt;asked volunteers to jog or stretch for 30 minutes and then they showed them a sad clip from the film &lt;em&gt;The Champ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Participants who said they usually struggled to handle negative emotion were more intensely affected by the sad clip, just as you’d expect, but crucially this was less so if they had completed the jog (but not the stretching). The researchers said: “… a bout of moderate aerobic exercise appears to have helped those participants potentially more vulnerable to problematic affective dysregulation to be less susceptible to the impact or lingering effects of the stressor”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intense sprints may boost your ability to learn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Bernward Winter and his colleagues tested participants’ ability to learn new made-up words for objects after either two intense sprints of three-minutes length, after 40 minutes of gentle running, or after resting. Participants were able to learn 20 per cent faster after the sprints compared with the other conditions, and they showed superior memory retention when tested again a week later. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074742706001596&quot;&gt;Writing in the &lt;em&gt;Neurobiology of Learning and Memory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers said the blood measures they took suggested that the participants’ enhanced learning performance after sprints may have been associated with increased levels of dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine and BDNF. “This [finding] is pertinent to the organization of learning-supportive environments, e.g., in schools (intense exercise during the breaks),” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running a marathon seems to wipe your memory of the pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s not romanticise long-distance running. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/the_antimarathon/2016/05/running_a_marathon_is_a_dangerous_expensive_stupid_meaningless_task_don.html&quot;&gt;As Daniel Engber observed at &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;,  “a vast, disturbing literature has now accumulated on the ill effects of running marathons”, particularly all the pain, including chaffing, blisters and cramps. One way that repeat marathon runners seem to cope is that the satisfaction of completing a run gradually wipes their memories for the pain they went through. Researchers demonstrated this &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/04/16/marathon-runners-forget-how-painful-it-was/&quot;&gt;for a study published in &lt;em&gt;Memory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: they asked marathon runners to report their pain and emotions directly after completing a marathon and then caught up with them again six months later, to ask them to recall their earlier post-marathon pain. The runners tended to have forgotten just how much pain they’d been in, and this was especially true if they’d been on an emotional high at the end of the marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;African wolf photographed at Lake Abiata in Southern Ethiopia&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Lake_abiata-wolf-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovery of the African wolf&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1820, two German scientists travelled to Egypt and East Africa on a scientific expedition. Wilhelm Friedrich Hemprich (a comparative physiologist) and Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg (a comparative anatomist, famous also for his work on paleontological micro-organisms) made observations and collected both botanical and animal specimens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, Hembrich did not survive the trip. Ehrenberg returned alone, and published papers on their findings in several volumes. In the volume on mammals of boreal Africa and western Asia (now available electronically at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/&lt;/a&gt;) he described a canid (i.e. a member of the dog family) species as an Egyptian wolf, &lt;em&gt;Canis lupaster&lt;/em&gt;, referring to its wolf like appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8835&quot; style=&quot;width: 270px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;German scientist Christian Ehrenberg described the African wolf in 1832&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8835&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/EhrenbergChristianGottfried_585-260x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;260&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;German scientist Christian Ehrenberg described the African wolf in 1832&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century and early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, zoologists continued to recognize this medium-sized canid in Sub-Saharan Africa. Some scholars thought there were two species: the larger eastern form, the wolf &lt;em&gt;lupaster&lt;/em&gt;, and a smaller western form. Some also suggested the western form could be the same as the golden jackal found in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Glover Morrill Allen, the American zoologist and curator for the Museum of Comparative Zoology, published a checklist of African Mammals in 1939, he omitted the wolf entirely and synonymized both forms with the Eurasian golden jackal (&lt;em&gt;Canis aureus&lt;/em&gt;). This synonymy became commonly accepted. Interestingly, some physiological (e.g. Tembrock) and paleontological (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-4983.2011.01039.x/full&quot;&gt;Geraads 2011&lt;/a&gt;) works continued recognizing the African species as a separate one. This African species was most often called &lt;em&gt;Canis anthus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8836&quot; style=&quot;width: 910px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;African wolf from the Bale Mountains, Ethiopia&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8836&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/ROBE-GORO-wolf.jpg&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;African wolf from the Bale Mountains, Ethiopia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Håkan Pohlstrand&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scats and skulls led to the rediscovery of the African wolf&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of our group studied canids in Ethiopia when DNA from a scat sample collected from the Guassa highlands showed similarities to the Eurasian gray wolf. Originally this scat was thought to come from a rodent-specializing rare canid, the Ethiopian wolf (&lt;em&gt;Canis simensis&lt;/em&gt;). Confused but intrigued, the team decided to follow a “golden jackal” and succeeded in taking a video record of its activities including defecation. The DNA from that scat was analysed and surprisingly it was a match for the mystery wolf DNA from the original scat sample. For the first time, direct proof was obtained showing that the “golden jackal” of the Ethiopian highlands is actually a close relative of the Gray wolf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former African golden jackal was renamed the African wolf (&lt;em&gt;Canis lupus lupaster&lt;/em&gt;) in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016385&quot;&gt;paper published&lt;/a&gt; based on these results (Rueness &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; 2011). Following this, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042740&quot;&gt;Philippe Gaubert and co-authors&lt;/a&gt;, using the same mtDNA sequences, documented that the range of the African wolf extends to Algeria, Mali and Senegal. In 2015, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215007873&quot;&gt;Koepfli &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. provided results &lt;/a&gt;on the autosomal genes confirming the conclusion. No golden jackal genotypes were found in Africa. These authors also constructed a phylogeny demonstrating one million years of separate evolution for the African wolf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmczool.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40850-017-0015-0&quot;&gt;In our new paper&lt;/a&gt;, we then carried out a taxonomic investigation on the African wolf. The decision of taxonomic assignment is made by comparison to the type specimen – each species has a type available for comparison when taxonomists are in doubt. However the type specimen for &lt;em&gt;Canis anthus&lt;/em&gt; was problematic. Frederic Cuvier, who described the species &lt;em&gt;Canis anthus,&lt;/em&gt; ascribed two type specimens, both of which are lost. There is also the possibility that these two represented different species. &lt;em&gt;Canis anthus&lt;/em&gt; is clearly a nomen dubium (doubtful name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The African wolf is rather the &lt;em&gt;Canis lupaster&lt;/em&gt; of Hembrich and Ehrenberg: the type specimen was collected during their expedition and is housed in Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin. It is a female with both the skull and skin preserved. The Museum has also over 100 African wolf skulls from different parts of the continent, and similar numbers of the Eurasian golden jackal. In addition to this material, we were able to study the canid skulls housed in all the major Fennoscandian museums, as well as those in Addis Abeba, Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a skull and skin taxonomy assessment of the species, and did a comparison to other canid species. Our conclusions confirmed that what is called the golden jackal in Africa is not the same species as the golden jackal in Eurasia. This was in agreement with our molecular analyses, which found no evidence for presence of the golden jackal on the African continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study showed a story that is familiar for canid specialists. The African wolf has a very conservative morphology, but there is significant variation in cranial and dental morphology within the species; this explains the previous confusion. Careful analyses were needed to assign the specimens to the species and understand the evolutionarily significant phenotypic plasticity within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Museum collections and an integrative approach for taxonomy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8837&quot; style=&quot;width: 2602px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Some of the African wolf skulls housed in the Naturkundemuseum, Berlin&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8837&quot; height=&quot;1936&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/museum_skulls.jpg&quot; width=&quot;2592&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Some of the African wolf skulls housed in the Naturkundemuseum, Berlin&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An integrative approach, utilizing both molecular and morphological methods (in this case, skin and skull taxonomy), is necessary for proper taxonomic work. And proper taxonomic work is needed to understand species and their relationships. This kind of solid taxonomic work is also the basis for conservation efforts. Natural history museum collections must be utilized, as they often provide the best material for this work. Altogether, our work has provided a reclassification of the African wolf clarifying two centuries of wonder and confusion regarding the species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abundance and distribution of the African wolf is not currently known (http://www.iucnredlist.org/). Like its larger cousin in the Northern hemisphere, African wolves are flexible in their habitat use. They range from wooded areas to arid desert, and are found in high altitudes in the Ethiopian mountains, up to 3,800 kilometers. They seem able to accommodate close proximity to humans. However, they still suffer from habitat destruction, and the risk of extinction remains a threat. The fact that the African wolf is a representative species of a unique wolf radiation to Africa calls for an urgent conservation assessment and future studies of the species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What have we learnt from this – over and beyond providing a proper description of the species Rueness &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; (2011) discovered? The title of our paper points to that: ‘Rediscovering a forgotten canid species’. Scientists taking full advantage of modern technology-driven biological developments within biology (such as sequencing technologies), and scientists taking a more classical approach to biology, become much stronger when working together – as we have done in this &lt;em&gt;BMC Zoology&lt;/em&gt; contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

 Cancer cells elude anti-tumour immunity through multiple mechanisms, including upregulated expression of ligands for inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors. Phagocytosis by macrophages plays a critical role in cancer control. Therapeutic blockade of signal regulatory protein (SIRP)-α, an inhibitory receptor on macrophages, or of its ligand CD47 expressed on tumour cells, improves tumour cell elimination in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that blockade of the SIRPα–CD47 checkpoint could be useful in treating human cancer. However, the pro-phagocytic receptor(s) responsible for tumour cell phagocytosis is(are) largely unknown. Here we find that macrophages are much more efficient at phagocytosis of haematopoietic tumour cells, compared with non-haematopoietic tumour cells, in response to SIRPα–CD47 blockade. Using a mouse lacking the signalling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family of homotypic haematopoietic cell-specific receptors, we determined that phagocytosis of haematopoietic tumour cells during SIRPα–CD47 blockade was strictly dependent on SLAM family receptors in vitro and in vivo. In both mouse and human cells, this function required a single SLAM family member, SLAMF7 (also known as CRACC, CS1, CD319), expressed on macrophages and tumour cell targets. In contrast to most SLAM receptor functions, SLAMF7-mediated phagocytosis was independent of signalling lymphocyte activation molecule-associated protein (SAP) adaptors. Instead, it depended on the ability of SLAMF7 to interact with integrin Mac-1 (refs 18, 19, 20) and utilize signals involving immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs. These findings elucidate the mechanism by which macrophages engulf and destroy haematopoietic tumour cells. They also reveal a novel SAP adaptor-independent function for a SLAM receptor. Lastly, they suggest that patients with tumours expressing SLAMF7 are more likely to respond to SIRPα–CD47 blockade therapy.

 Parental care is essential for the survival of mammals, yet the mechanisms underlying its evolution remain largely unknown. Here we show that two sister species of mice, Peromyscus polionotus and Peromyscus maniculatus, have large and heritable differences in parental behaviour. Using quantitative genetics, we identify 12 genomic regions that affect parental care, 8 of which have sex-specific effects, suggesting that parental care can evolve independently in males and females. Furthermore, some regions affect parental care broadly, whereas others affect specific behaviours, such as nest building. Of the genes linked to differences in nest-building behaviour, vasopressin is differentially expressed in the hypothalamus of the two species, with increased levels associated with less nest building. Using pharmacology in Peromyscus and chemogenetics in Mus, we show that vasopressin inhibits nest building but not other parental behaviours. Together, our results indicate that variation in an ancient neuropeptide contributes to interspecific differences in parental care.

 Ageing drives changes in neuronal and cognitive function, the decline of which is a major feature of many neurological disorders. The hippocampus, a brain region subserving roles of spatial and episodic memory and learning, is sensitive to the detrimental effects of ageing at morphological and molecular levels. With advancing age, synapses in various hippocampal subfields exhibit impaired long-term potentiation, an electrophysiological correlate of learning and memory. At the molecular level, immediate early genes are among the synaptic plasticity genes that are both induced by long-term potentiation and downregulated in the aged brain. In addition to revitalizing other aged tissues, exposure to factors in young blood counteracts age-related changes in these central nervous system parameters, although the identities of specific cognition-promoting factors or whether such activity exists in human plasma remains unknown. We hypothesized that plasma of an early developmental stage, namely umbilical cord plasma, provides a reservoir of such plasticity-promoting proteins. Here we show that human cord plasma treatment revitalizes the hippocampus and improves cognitive function in aged mice. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2), a blood-borne factor enriched in human cord plasma, young mouse plasma, and young mouse hippocampi, appears in the brain after systemic administration and increases synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent cognition in aged mice. Depletion experiments in aged mice revealed TIMP2 to be necessary for the cognitive benefits conferred by cord plasma. We find that systemic pools of TIMP2 are necessary for spatial memory in young mice, while treatment of brain slices with TIMP2 antibody prevents long-term potentiation, arguing for previously unknown roles for TIMP2 in normal hippocampal function. Our findings reveal that human cord plasma contains plasticity-enhancing proteins of high translational value for targeting ageing- or disease-associated hippocampal dysfunction.

 Human members of the solute carrier 1 (SLC1) family of transporters take up excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain and amino acids in peripheral organs. Dysregulation of the function of SLC1 transporters is associated with neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Here we present crystal structures of a thermostabilized human SLC1 transporter, the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1), with and without allosteric and competitive inhibitors bound. The structures reveal architectural features of the human transporters, such as intra- and extracellular domains that have potential roles in transport function, regulation by lipids and post-translational modifications. The coordination of the allosteric inhibitor in the structures and the change in the transporter dynamics measured by hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry reveal a mechanism of inhibition, in which the transporter is locked in the outward-facing states of the transport cycle. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and pharmacology of human SLC1 transporters.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Mammalian genomes are spatially organized by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin into chromatin loops and topologically associated domains, which have important roles in gene regulation and recombination. By binding to specific sequences, CTCF defines contact points for cohesin-mediated long-range chromosomal cis-interactions. Cohesin is also present at these sites, but has been proposed to be loaded onto DNA elsewhere and to extrude chromatin loops until it encounters CTCF bound to DNA. How cohesin is recruited to CTCF sites, according to this or other models, is unknown. Here we show that the distribution of cohesin in the mouse genome depends on transcription, CTCF and the cohesin release factor Wings apart-like (Wapl). In CTCF-depleted fibroblasts, cohesin cannot be properly recruited to CTCF sites but instead accumulates at transcription start sites of active genes, where the cohesin-loading complex is located. In the absence of both CTCF and Wapl, cohesin accumulates in up to 70 kilobase-long regions at 3′-ends of active genes, in particular if these converge on each other. Changing gene expression modulates the position of these ‘cohesin islands’. These findings indicate that transcription can relocate mammalian cohesin over long distances on DNA, as previously reported for yeast cohesin, that this translocation contributes to positioning cohesin at CTCF sites, and that active genes can be freed from cohesin either by transcription-mediated translocation or by Wapl-mediated release.

 &lt;p&gt;
 The recent arrival of Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans in Europe was followed by rapid expansion of its geographical distribution and host range, confirming the unprecedented threat that this chytrid fungus poses to western Palaearctic amphibians. Mitigating this hazard requires a thorough understanding of the pathogen’s disease ecology that is driving the extinction process. Here, we monitored infection, disease and host population dynamics in a Belgian fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) population for two years immediately after the first signs of infection. We show that arrival of this chytrid is associated with rapid population collapse without any sign of recovery, largely due to lack of increased resistance in the surviving salamanders and a demographic shift that prevents compensation for mortality. The pathogen adopts a dual transmission strategy, with environmentally resistant non-motile spores in addition to the motile spores identified in its sister species B. dendrobatidis. The fungus retains its virulence not only in water and soil, but also in anurans and less susceptible urodelan species that function as infection reservoirs. The combined characteristics of the disease ecology suggest that further expansion of this fungus will behave as a ‘perfect storm’ that is able to rapidly extirpate highly susceptible salamander populations across Europe.

 The non-essential amino acids serine and glycine are used in multiple anabolic processes that support cancer cell growth and proliferation (reviewed in ref. 1). While some cancer cells upregulate de novo serine synthesis, many others rely on exogenous serine for optimal growth. Restriction of dietary serine and glycine can reduce tumour growth in xenograft and allograft models. Here we show that this observation translates into more clinically relevant autochthonous tumours in genetically engineered mouse models of intestinal cancer (driven by Apc inactivation) or lymphoma (driven by Myc activation). The increased survival following dietary restriction of serine and glycine in these models was further improved by antagonizing the anti-oxidant response. Disruption of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (using biguanides) led to a complex response that could improve or impede the anti-tumour effect of serine and glycine starvation. Notably, Kras-driven mouse models of pancreatic and intestinal cancers were less responsive to depletion of serine and glycine, reflecting an ability of activated Kras to increase the expression of enzymes that are part of the serine synthesis pathway and thus promote de novo serine synthesis.

 Chromatin remodellers are helicase-like, ATP-dependent enzymes that alter chromatin structure and nucleosome positions to allow regulatory proteins access to DNA. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of chromatin remodeller Switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI2/SNF2) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae bound to the nucleosome. The structure shows that the two core domains of Snf2 are realigned upon nucleosome binding, suggesting activation of the enzyme. The core domains contact each other through two induced Brace helices, which are crucial for coupling ATP hydrolysis to chromatin remodelling. Snf2 binds to the phosphate backbones of one DNA gyre of the nucleosome mainly through its helicase motifs within the major domain cleft, suggesting a conserved mechanism of substrate engagement across different remodellers. Snf2 contacts the second DNA gyre via a positively charged surface, providing a mechanism to anchor the remodeller at a fixed position of the nucleosome. Snf2 locally deforms nucleosomal DNA at the site of binding, priming the substrate for the remodelling reaction. Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into chromatin remodelling.
