 &lt;p&gt;Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine candidate may be more effective than early results suggested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just a week after releasing interim results suggesting the vaccine was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-pfizer-effective-early-trial-data&quot;&gt;more than 90 percent effective&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/9/20&lt;/em&gt;), the pharmaceutical giant and its German biotech partner BioNTech announced final results of their 41,000-person clinical trial. A final analysis indicates that the vaccine is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine&quot;&gt;safe and 95 percent effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing illness, the companies announced November 18. The results, shared in a news release, have yet to be peer reviewed by other scientists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Final results depended on getting a certain number of infections in the study group. Normally it might take months to tally the cases needed to make a final efficacy determination, but infection rates in the United States have been so high that coronavirus cases quickly racked up in the trial, speeding up the timeline for analyzing the final results. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among 170 volunteers who contracted COVID-19, 162 had gotten a placebo. Just eight cases were recorded in the group that received the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Efficacy of Pfizer’s vaccine is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moderna-vaccine-covid19-coronavirus-early-results&quot;&gt;comparable to preliminary results from Moderna’s vaccine&lt;/a&gt; trial, announced November 16 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/16/20&lt;/em&gt;). Both vaccines use messenger RNA, or mRNA, to carry instructions for making the coronavirus’ spike protein to human cells. Human cells read those instructions and produce the viral protein, priming the immune system to ward off the virus should it be encountered later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vaccine, which requires two shots spaced a month apart, may also lessen severity of the disease. During the trial 10 people became severely ill. Nine of those people were in the placebo group, while one severely ill person was in the vaccine group. Among people 65 and older, the vaccine was more than 94 percent effective, the companies said. That’s particularly good news because vaccines often are not as effective in older people, because immune systems tend to weaken with age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and BioNTech plan to apply to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for an emergency use authorization within days, and say 50 million doses of the vaccine — enough to immunize roughly 25 million people — will be available by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The news comes as COVID-19 cases continue to skyrocket. As of November 18, nearly 58 million people globally have been infected and 1.3 million people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University’s COVID-19 tracker. The United States leads the world in cases, with 11.4 million infections and nearly 249,000 deaths. More than 100,000 new cases and about 1,500 deaths are being recorded nationwide every day, and many states are tightening or implementing new public health measures to counter the virus’s spread.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-medium is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fossil Men book cover&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3093507&quot; height=&quot;287&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/112120_reviews_cover-264x383.jpg&quot; width=&quot;198&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3luhAdT&quot;&gt;Fossil Men&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kermit Pattison&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;William Morrow, $32.50&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She is the most controversial, convention-defying, weirdest-looking fossil hominid ever found. Fittingly, the group that discovered this 4.4-million-year-old adult female, nicknamed Ardi, includes the most controversial, convention-defying (and some would say weirdest-acting) fossil hunters and bone analysts to have ever wrestled with the puzzle of how humans and our ancestors evolved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Fossil Men&lt;/em&gt;, journalist Kermit Pattison recounts intriguing backstories of the Ardi scientists and how they came to challenge popular views of hominid evolution. Many incidents in the book show the courage and grit it took to find and excavate Ardi in Ethiopia’s remote Middle Awash area, where local nomadic groups are prone to shoot at outsiders. Pattison also examines how Ardi’s skeleton makes her a one-of-a-kind find.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Standing at the center of this ancestral spectacle is team leader Tim White, a paleoanthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley. A demanding and intense taskmaster in the field, White has a hard-earned reputation as one of the all-time great fossil hunters. Pattison describes White as having remarkably keen eyes for assessing fossil bones and a knack for brutal, sarcastic takedowns of evolutionary arguments (and scientists) he finds deficient. In a published review of an eminent anthropologist’s book claiming that hominid evolution included many species, White called him a purveyor of “politically correct paleoanthropological pontification” that didn’t rise to the level of fiction such as &lt;em&gt;The Clan of the Cave Bear&lt;/em&gt;. Not surprisingly, White has amassed scientific enemies since the early 1970s, when he worked with members of the fossil-hunting Leakey family in Africa. He takes his professional infamy in stride.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After helping to study and classify the famous Lucy partial skeleton following its discovery in 1974, White’s friendship with Lucy’s discoverer Donald Johanson broke up, much as his relationship with the Leakeys had. White then took a position at Berkeley in 1977, where he joined forces with archaeologist J. Desmond Clark to hunt for hominid fossils in the Middle Awash. There, remains older than 3.2-million-year-old Lucy were likely waiting. Clark recruited Ethiopia’s Berhane Asfaw to Berkeley’s graduate anthropology program, the first of a series of Ethiopians the Ardi team trained as paleoanthropologists. Asfaw joined the White-led fossil expeditions and had headed an Ethiopian museum that now houses Ardi.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Pattison recounts a pivotal moment in the field when the team encountered a man named Gadi, a hunchbacked, gun-wielding warrior from a local tribe called the Afar. White struck up a friendship with Gadi, who became a one-man security force for the researchers. In 1993, it was Gadi who noticed a tooth on the ground that was the first of 10 teeth the team found from the same hominid individual. These clues led to the identification of a new species, &lt;em&gt;Ardipithecus ramidus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first pieces of Ardi’s partial skeleton — including much of the skull, hands, limbs and pelvis — were found the following year, about 100 kilometers south of where Lucy had been unearthed. Pattison uses anecdotes from the field, gleaned from interviews and White’s trove of videos and photos from years of fieldwork, to describe the dangers and rigors of the three years it took to excavate Ardi’s remains. Pattison also illuminates how an insistence by White’s team on painstaking preservation of the fragile fossils and exhaustive comparisons to other species to reconstruct Ardi’s body plan over the next 15 years clashed with many paleoanthropologists’ desire to get quick access to Ardi for their own studies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The literary flow slows as Pattison probes the ins and outs of Ardi’s skeletal parts. But patient readers are rewarded with a vision of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/evolutions-bad-girl&quot;&gt;a somewhat apelike, somewhat monkeylike, somewhat humanlike creature&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/16/10, p. 22&lt;/em&gt;) that, its discoverers argue, destroys the influential view that early hominids looked much like chimpanzees after having evolved from a knuckle-walking ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested in fossil hunting, evolutionary science and a hominid skeleton like no other, this book delivers.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo: A user plays &lt;/em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;em&gt;, one of the games studied in the new research. William West/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Video games get blamed for a lot. There are long-standing debates about whether violence in video games leads to real-world aggression, or whether video game “addiction” is something we should worry about. And some people have broader fears that more time spent on screens negatively affects our mental health and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/06/these-violent-delights-dont-have-violent-ends-study-finds-no-link-between-violent-video-games-and-teen-aggression/&quot;&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/video-game-addiction-facts-statistics&quot;&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/31/link-between-teens-time-on-digital-devices-and-lower-wellbeing-is-too-small-to-merit-substantial-scientific-discussion/&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have failed to find much evidence to back up these kinds of concerns. But the field suffers from some pretty big limitations. In particular, studies often rely on people reporting their own time spent consuming media — and we’re notoriously unreliable at making those sorts of estimates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enter a new study from Niklas Johannes and colleagues at the Oxford Internet Institute, published as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/qrjza/&quot;&gt;preprint on &lt;em&gt;PsyArxiv&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;earlier this week. The researchers find that more time spent playing video games actually relates to &lt;em&gt;greater&lt;/em&gt; wellbeing (though there are plenty of caveats to that finding — more on those later). But the most interesting part of the study is really its methodology: rather than relying on people reporting their own video game use, the researchers established a rare collaboration with games companies in order to get precise data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40867&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two companies, Electronic Arts and Nintendo, provided the team with data from players of &lt;em&gt;Plants vs Zombies:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Battle for Neighborville &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons &lt;/em&gt;respectively. The companies sent out surveys to hundreds of thousands of adult players; these included a wellbeing measure, in which participants rated how often they’d experienced six positive and six negative feelings in the past two weeks. Crucially, the companies also provided data on the number and length of the players’ gaming sessions during those two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only a fraction of people responded, ultimately leaving the team with data from 471 &lt;em&gt;Plants vs Zombies&lt;/em&gt; players and 2,756 &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing &lt;/em&gt;players. And they found that, overall, the more time people spent playing over that two week period, the greater their wellbeing tended to be. It’s worth noting that although significant, this effect was small: even a large increase in time spent playing was related to a very modest increase in wellbeing. Importantly, the data also showed that people weren’t great at estimating how long they had spent playing over the two week period — their estimates were off by about two hours, highlighting the problems of relying just on self-report data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results, then, cast further doubt on the idea that spending more time playing video games is detrimental to our mental health. In fact, the study suggests that there is some kind of link between playing video games for longer and &lt;em&gt;greater&lt;/em&gt; wellbeing. This is clearly noteworthy, as so much of the discussion around video games (and screen time generally) just assumes that limiting the time spent playing is a good thing, without acknowledging that it could potentially have detrimental effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, inevitably, over the past few days we’ve seen a lot of headlines proclaiming that video games are “good for wellbeing” or “benefit mental health”. That may well be true. But it’s not really possible to make those kinds of claims from the study’s correlational data. Perhaps people who are happier play video games for longer. Or maybe it’s something else entirely that both leads people to play video games for longer and boosts wellbeing (having the luxury of free time, for example). And even if there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a causal link, it’s not clear that it would be a meaningful one, given that the size of the effect was so small.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are other limitations too. The data comes from the small group of people who chose to complete the survey, all of whom were over 18. So the study can’t necessarily say much about potential effects among the broader population, particularly young people. And it remains to be seen whether time spent playing other kinds of games relates to similar changes in wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s important to point out that the authors do go to lengths to explain these limitations in the paper. But it feels like the nuances have been brushed over in much of the media coverage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, none of this should detract from the most interesting and exciting part of the study: the fact that the researchers have collaborated with industry and obtained real data on people’s playing habits. The lack of access to data from media companies has long been a major obstacle to this kind of work, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/28/episode-19-should-we-worry-about-screen-time/&quot;&gt;Amy Orben told us earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps this study will pave the way for further collaboration. Indeed, the researchers call on companies to share data from other games and audiences, and across longer time-scales. Hopefully this kind of data will help to answer some of the intriguing questions that the study poses.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/qrjza/&quot;&gt;Video game play is positively correlated with well-being&lt;/a&gt; [this paper is a preprint meaning that it has not yet been subjected to peer review and the final published version may differ from the version this report was based on]&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;In the film &lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt;, astronaut Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon) survives being stranded on the Red Planet by farming potatoes in Martian dirt fertilized with feces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future Mars astronauts could grow crops in dirt to avoid solely relying on resupply missions, and to grow a greater amount and variety of food than with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-eats&quot;&gt;hydroponics&lt;/a&gt; alone (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/4/11&lt;/em&gt;). But new lab experiments suggest that growing food on the Red Planet will be a lot more complicated than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/martian-entertaining-science-fiction-rooted-fact&quot;&gt;simply planting crops with poop&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/22/15&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers planted lettuce and the weed &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/em&gt; in three kinds of fake Mars dirt. Two were made from materials mined in Hawaii or the Mojave Desert that look like dirt on Mars. To mimic the makeup of the Martian surface even more closely, the third was made from scratch using volcanic rock, clays, salts and other chemical ingredients that NASA’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-curiosity-mars-rover-weighed-mountain-its-climbing&quot;&gt;Curiosity rover&lt;/a&gt; has seen on the Red Planet (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/31/19&lt;/em&gt;). While both lettuce and &lt;em&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/em&gt; survived in the Marslike natural soils, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103520303845?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;neither could grow in the synthetic dirt&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report in the upcoming Jan. 15 &lt;em&gt;Icarus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not surprising at all that as you get [dirt] that’s more and more accurate, closer to Mars, that it gets harder and harder for plants to grow in it,” says planetary scientist Kevin Cannon of the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colo., who helped make the synthetic Mars dirt but wasn’t involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Soil on Earth is full of microbes and other organic matter that helps plants grow, but Mars dirt is basically crushed rock. The new result “tells you that if you want to grow plants on Mars using soil, you’re going to have to put in a lot of work to transform that material into something that plants can grow in,” Cannon says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biochemist Andrew Palmer and colleagues at the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne planted lettuce and &lt;em&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/em&gt; seeds in imitation Mars dirt under controlled lighting and temperature indoors, just as astronauts would on Mars. The plants were cultivated at 22° Celsius and about 70 percent humidity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seeds of both species germinated and grew in dirt mined from Hawaii or the Mojave Desert, as long as the plants were fertilized with a cocktail of nitrogen, potassium, calcium and other nutrients. No seeds of either species could germinate in the synthetic dirt, so “we would grow up plants under hydroponic-like conditions, and then we would transfer them” to the artificial dirt, Palmer says. But even when given fertilizer, those seedlings died within a week of transplanting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Plants growing in Mojave Desert soil&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3093593&quot; height=&quot;405&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/111320_mt_marsfarm_inline1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3093593&quot;&gt;In lab experiments, lettuce was able to grow in Marslike soil from the Mojave Desert (pictured) as long as the soil was fertilized with nitrogen, potassium, calcium and other nutrients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3093593&quot;&gt;Nathan Hadland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Palmer’s team suspected that the problem with the synthetic Mars dirt was its high pH, which was about 9.5. The two natural soils had pH levels around 7. When the researchers treated the synthetic dirt with sulfuric acid to lower the pH to 7.2, transplanted seedlings survived an extra week but ultimately died.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also ran up against another problem: The original synthetic dirt recipe did not include calcium perchlorate, a toxic salt that recent observations suggest make up to about 2 percent of the Martian surface. When Palmer’s team added it at concentrations similar to those seen on Mars, neither lettuce nor &lt;em&gt;A. thaliana &lt;/em&gt;grew at all in the dirt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The perchlorate is a major problem” for Martian farming, says Edward Guinan, an astrobiologist at Villanova University in Pennsylvania who was not involved in the work. But calcium perchlorate may not have to be a showstopper. “There are bacteria on Earth that enjoy perchlorates as a food,” Guinan says. As the microbes eat the salt, they give off oxygen. If these bacteria were taken from Earth to Mars to munch on perchlorates in Martian dirt, Guinan imagines that the organisms could not only get rid of a toxic component of the dirt, but perhaps also help produce breathable oxygen for astronauts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the exact treatment required to make Martian dirt farmable may vary, depending on where astronauts make their homestead. “It probably depends where you land, what the geology and chemistry of the soil is going to be,” Guinan says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To explore how that variety might affect future agricultural practices, geochemist Laura Fackrell of the University of Georgia in Athens and colleagues mixed up five new types of faux Mars dirt. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103520304061?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;recipes for these fake Martian materials&lt;/a&gt;, also reported in the Jan. 15 &lt;em&gt;Icarus&lt;/em&gt;, are based on observations of Mars’ surface from the Curiosity, Spirit and Opportunity rovers, as well as NASA’s Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each new artificial Mars dirt represents a mix of materials that could be found or made on the Red Planet. One is designed to represent the average composition across Mars, similar to the synthetic material created by Cannon’s team. The other four varieties have slightly different makeups, such as dirt that is particularly rich in carbonates or sulfates. This collection “expands the palette of what we have available” as test-beds for agricultural experiments, Fackrell says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She’s now using her stock to run preliminary plant growth experiments. So far, a legume called moth bean, which has similar nutritional content to a soybean but is more drought resistant, has grown the best. “But they’re not necessarily super healthy,” Fackrell says. Future experiments could explore what nutrient cocktails help plants survive in the various fake Martian terrains. But this much is clear, Fackrell says: “It’s not quite as easy as it looks in &lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Shavika Rastogi will talk about her master thesis entitled &quot;Prediction of Electrode Position inside rat brain using Neuromorphic Hardware&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural probes with large number of close packed recording sites each comprising
of 32 electrodes are being developed for large scale neuronal recordings from
multiple brain areas simultaneously to understand complex brain activity in vivo.
By precisely mapping the position of each site inside rat brain, they help us to
characterize neural activity on the basis of cortical depth from where it is
obtained. Their application lies in neurosurgery, where it is important to locate
the target of surgical interest inside the brain in real time. In this work, we
have first compared various methods from literature to analyze extracellular
activity recorded using CMOS neural probes from different cortical depths and
from different locations along same lateral axis of rat brain to find a criterion
on the basis of which recordings can be classified. After finding out the most
promising criterion, we have tried to implement it on neuromorphic hardware
SpiNNaker. We tested single neuron and spiking excitatory-inhibitory network
for implementation and found that excitatory-inhibitory network is more robust to
noise present in signal and its output can be improved by introducing lateral
inhibition. Our results show that SpiNNaker can be used for rough indication of
cortical depth.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/democracy-5278455_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against a backdrop of the vote to leave the European Union, hostility towards migrants, and the growth in right-wing nationalist movements, racial discrimination is sadly on the rise in the UK. There is evidence that experiencing racial discrimination can negatively impact health. However, the majority of studies to date have been carried out in the US. The makeup of ethnic minority groups in the UK differs to that in the US, with those of South Asian backgrounds forming the largest minority group. Therefore, it is important to understand the extent to which racial discrimination impacts health in the UK-context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who reported racial discrimination were more likely to rate their health as poor and to suffer from a limiting longstanding illness at follow-up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09792-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Our study&lt;/a&gt; looked at over 4800 people who took part in the UK Household Longitudinal Study over a period of two years. One in five participants from an ethnic minority group reported racial discrimination (which included feeling unsafe, avoiding certain places, being insulted and being physically attacked). We found that these individuals were more likely to develop poorer mental and physical health after these experiences. Specifically, we found that perceived racial discrimination was associated with increased psychological distress and poorer mental functioning two-years later. Moreover, people who reported racial discrimination were more likely to rate their health as poor and to suffer from a limiting longstanding illness at follow-up, regardless of their health at the time of the discriminatory experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study builds upon previous research which has mostly measured racial discrimination and health at the same time, meaning that establishing the direction of the relationship is difficult. Here we show that the experience of racial discrimination precedes the development of poorer health. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4984732/&quot;&gt;One previous study&lt;/a&gt; linked racial discrimination with a deterioration in mental health in a UK sample. Our findings build upon this evidence and show that the negative effects of racial discrimination extend to physical health also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest racial discrimination is a chronic stressor, that might bring about changes in stress-related biology and stress-related health behaviors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how can experiencing racial discrimination lead to serious health outcomes? At the individual level, our findings suggest racial discrimination is a chronic stressor, that might bring about changes in stress-related biology and stress-related health behaviors (e.g. excessive alcohol intake) that can lead to poor health. Feeling discriminated against might also mean that people avoid engaging with health or well-being services perceived to be discriminatory. At the broader structural level, racial discrimination might negatively impact health through inequalities in healthcare and the unfair distribution of social determinants of health such as education, employment, and housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of racial discrimination is one that has garnered increasing attention, particularly this year in the wake of the Black Lives Matters protests. The results of our study are concerning suggesting an enduring impact of experiences of racism on mental and physical health. They highlight the need to tackle racial discrimination – not only as a human rights issue, but as an issue that may also have a lasting legacy on health. We need to educate, raise awareness, and promote activism to bring about legislative and social change required to eliminate racial discrimination both in the UK and worldwide. We also need to target the structural macro-level forces that shape the position of ethnic minorities in society. More research is needed to understand the pathways linking racial discrimination and health in order to develop interventions and policy that can be used to tackle socio-political processes that promote racial discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-necked-dinosaurs-sauropod-jurassic-herbivores"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3093603</id>
		<updated>2020-11-18T00:01:24+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Long-necked sauropods, the largest animals ever to walk on Earth, may have thundered into dominance during the Jurassic Period thanks to a large burst of volcanic activity that began around 184 million years ago, a new study suggests. The resulting environmental crisis may have caused a shift in plant life that gave the tough-toothed, big-gutted herbivores a powerful advantage over other herbivores.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The find comes from the discovery of a new fossil of one of the earliest “true” sauropods in Argentinian Patagonia. Sediments bearing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2020.2310&quot;&gt;newly described dinosaur, dubbed &lt;em&gt;Bagualia alba&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are precisely dated to 179 million years ago, paleontologist Diego Pol of the Paleontological Museum Egidio Feruglio in Trelew, Argentina, and colleagues report November 18 in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the Royal Society B&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;B. alba&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers found, had the telltale characteristics of true sauropods: large, column-like legs; massive size; long necks relative to the body; broad and strong jaws; and large, spoon-shaped teeth with thick enamel. Also known as eusauropods, this lineage&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-necked-dinosaurs-grew-be-giants-more-ways-one&quot;&gt; came to dominate the Middle and Late Jurassic&lt;/a&gt; roughly 174 million to 145 million years ago (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/10/18&lt;/em&gt;), giving rise to awe-inspiring giants such as &lt;em&gt;Argentinosaurus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-analysis-cuts-massive-dinos-weight-half&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dreadnoughtus schrani&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/9/15&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the Early Jurassic, between about 201 million and 174 million years ago, Pol says, plant-eating sauropods competed with many other herbivores, including sauropodomorphs — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/early-sauropod-went-walking-four-legs-two-it-grew&quot;&gt;distant relatives such as &lt;em&gt;Mussaurus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;patagonicus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with less powerful jaws and shorter necks (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/20/19&lt;/em&gt;). What gave the eusauropod giants a leg up on their herbivorous competition has been unclear, in part because there are relatively few fossils dating to the transition between Early and Middle Jurassic.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;One possible culprit was an environmental crisis that occurred toward the end of the Early Jurassic, an episode of global warming and ocean acidification that led to a series of species extinctions, particularly in the oceans but also on land. Scientists have previously suggested this episode was linked to large volcanic eruptions in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That pulse of volcanism may also have led to a major shift in plant life in the region. The Early Jurassic was dominated by seed ferns, cycads and gingkoes, but by the Middle Jurassic, conifers began to flourish in the more arid, warmer climate. That, in turn, may have made life difficult for many sauropodomorphs, which vanish from the fossil record after the Early Jurassic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;B. alba&lt;/em&gt;, the study shows, was alive and well 179 million years ago, well after the volcanic aftermath. Pol and colleagues suggest that &lt;em&gt;B. alba&lt;/em&gt; and other eusauropods may have been best positioned to chomp on the conifers’ very tough leaves. Their extra-powerful jaws and teeth were able to chew those leaves, and their oversized guts were well-adapted to digest the tough plant matter, allowing it to sit and ferment for many days, Pol and colleagues suggest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The careful dating of the new fossil is a crucial piece of the puzzle, Pol says, because “it provides the first precise evidence [that] the large sauropods became the dominant herbivores in terrestrial ecosystems right after the massive volcanic event.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;a hand holding a fossil tooth&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3093604&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/111720_cg_sauropods_inline_680-600x450.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3093604&quot;&gt;The tooth of &lt;em&gt;Bagualia alba&lt;/em&gt;, discovered in Argentinian Patagonia, bears the typical thick enamel and spoon shape of sauropods. These features helped the creatures munch on the tough leaves of conifers, which flourished after about 180 million years ago. New research suggests this ability may have enabled sauropods to become dominant in the Jurassic Period.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3093604&quot;&gt;Santiago Reuil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new fossil “is an important addition to our frustratingly incomplete picture of early sauropod evolution,” says Paul Barrett, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London. And the coincidence between the age of the fossil and a major pulse of volcanic activity in the region is intriguing, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, he says, “I’d like to see a bit more evidence before scaling this up to a global event” that led to shifts in both plant and dinosaur evolution. Although this is the earliest true sauropod fossil yet found, the lineage of sauropods is thought to go back another 40 million years, into the Late Triassic, based on analyses of the animals’ family tree. And scientists know very little about how those earlier sauropods might have fed, or even where in the world they may have lived. For example, it’s possible that the first true sauropods lived in places where those climatic and floral changes didn’t occur.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, though, “the authors provide an interesting new idea that we can test with new discoveries in the future,” Barrett says. “If they’re right, this would give a neat insight into understanding linkages between the evolution of the planet, climate, flora and fauna.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960076020302764?via%3Dihub&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recently published&lt;/a&gt; pilot study on the efficacy of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (calcifediol) in reducing ICU admission of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, concluded that the treatment “seems able to reduce the severity of disease, but larger trials with groups properly matched will be required go show a definitive answer”. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.08.20222638v1&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;follow-up&lt;/a&gt; paper, Jungreis and &lt;a href=&quot;https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2014/02/11/the-network-nonsense-of-manolis-kellis/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kellis&lt;/a&gt; re-examine this so-called “Córdoba study” and argue that the authors of the study have undersold their results. Based on a reanalysis of the data in a manner they describe as “rigorous” and using “well established statistical techniques”, they urge the medical community to “consider testing the vitamin D levels of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and taking remedial action for those who are deficient.” Their recommendation is based on two claims: in an examination of unevenness in the distribution of one of the comorbidities between cases and controls, they conclude that there is “no evidence of incorrect randomization”, and they present a “mathematical theorem” to make the case that the effect size in the Córdoba study is significant to the extent that “they can be confident that if assignment to the treatment group had no effect, we would not have observed these results simply due to chance.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the “mathematical analysis” of Jungreis and Kellis is deeply flawed, and their “theorem” is vacuous. Their analysis cannot be used to conclude that the Córdoba study shows that calcifediol significantly reduces ICU admission of hospitalized COVID- 19 patients. Moreover, the Córdoba study is fundamentally flawed, and therefore there is nothing to learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Córdoba study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Córdoba study, described by the authors as a pilot, was ostensibly a randomized controlled trial, designed to determine the efficacy of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in reducing ICU admission of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The study consisted of 76 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 symptoms, with 50 of the patients treated with calcifediol, and 26 not receiving treatment. Patients were administered “standard care”, which according to the authors consisted of “a combination of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and for patients with pneumonia and NEWS score 5, a broad spectrum antibiotic”. Crucially, admission to the ICU was determined by a “Selection Committee” consisting of intensivists, pulmonologists, internists, and members of an ethics committee. The Selection Committee based ICU admission decisions on the evaluation of several criteria, including presence of comorbidities, and the level of dependence of patients according to their needs and clinical criteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result of the Córdoba trial was that only 1/50 of the treated patients was admitted to the ICU, whereas 13/26 of the untreated patients were admitted (p-value = 7.7 ∗ 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; by Fisher’s exact test). This is a minuscule p-value but it is meaningless. Since there is no record of the Selection Committee deliberations, it impossible to know whether the ICU admission of the 13 untreated patients was due to their previous high blood pressure comorbidity. Perhaps the 11 treated patients with the comorbidity were not admitted to the ICU because they were older, and the Selection Committee considered their previous higher blood pressure to be more “normal” (14/50 treatment patients were over the age of 60, versus only 5/26 of the untreated patients).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1: Table 2 from [1] showing the comorbidities of patients. It is reproduced by virtue of [1] being published open access under the CC-BY license.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact that admission to the ICU could be decided in part based on the presence of co-morbidities, and that there was a significant imbalance in one of the comorbidities, immediately renders the study results meaningless. There are several other problems with it that potentially confound the results: the study did not examine the Vitamin D levels of the treated patients, nor was the untreated group administered a placebo. Most importantly, the study numbers were tiny, with only 76 patients examined. Small studies are notoriously problematic, and are known to produce large effect sizes [9]. Furthermore, sloppiness in the study does not lead to confidence in the results. The authors state that the “rigorous protocol” for determining patient admission to the ICU is available as Supplementary Material, but there is no Supplementary Material distributed with the paper. There is also an embarrassing typo: Fisher’s exact test is referred to twice as “Fischer’s test”. To err once in describing this classical statistical test may be regarded as misfortune; to do it twice looks like carelessness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pointless statistics exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Córdoba study has not received much attention, which is not surprising considering that by the authors’ own admission it was a pilot that at best only motivates a properly matched and powered randomized controlled trial. Indeed, the authors mention that such a trial (the COVIDIOL trial), with data being collected from 15 hospitals in Spain, is underway. Nevertheless, Jungreis and Kellis [3], apparently mesmerized by the 7.7 ∗ 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; p-value for ICU admission upon treatment, felt the need to “rescue” the study with what amounts to faux statistical gravitas. They argue for immediate consideration of testing Vitamin D levels of hospitalized patients, so that “deficient” patients can be administered some form of Vitamin D “to the extent it can be done safely”. Their message has been noticed; only a few days after [3] appeared the authors’ tweet to promote it has been retweeted more than 50 times [8].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jungreis and Kellis claim that the p-value for the effect of calcifediol on patients is so significant, that in and of itself it merits belief that administration of calcifediol does, in fact, prevent admission of patients to ICUs. To make their case, Jungreis and Kellis begin by acknowledging that imbalance between the treated and untreated groups in the previous high blood pressure comorbidity may be a problem, but claim that there is “no evidence of incorrect randomization.” Their argument is as follows: they note that while the p-value for the imbalance in the previous high blood pressure comorbidity is 0.0023, it should be adjusted for the fact that there are 15 distinct comorbidities, and that just by chance, when computing so many p-values, one might be small. First, an examination of Table 2 in [1] (Figure 1) shows that there were only 14 comorbidities assessed, as none of the patients had previous chronic kidney disease. Thus, the number 15 is incorrect. Second, Jungreis and Kellis argue that a Bonferroni correction should be applied, and that this correction should be based on 30 tests (=15 × 2). The reason for the factor of 2 is that they claim that when testing for imbalance, one should test for imbalance in both directions. By applying the Bonferroni correction to the p-values, they derive a “corrected” p-value for previous high blood pressure being imbalanced between groups of 0.069. They are wrong on several counts in deriving this number. To illustrate the problems we work through the calculation step-by-step:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The question we want to answer is as follows: given that there are multiple comorbidities, is there is a significant imbalance in &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; one comorbidity. There are several ways to test for this, with the simplest being Šidák’s correction [10] given by&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;q \quad = \quad 1-(1-m)^n,&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+%5Cquad+%3D+%5Cquad+1-%281-m%29%5En%2C&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=545454&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; title=&quot;q \quad = \quad 1-(1-m)^n,&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;where &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; is the minimum p-value among the comorbidities, and &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; is the number of tests. Plugging in &lt;em&gt;m = 0.0023&lt;/em&gt; (the smallest p-value in Table 2 of [1]) and &lt;em&gt;n = 14&lt;/em&gt; (the number of comorbidities) one gets 0.032 (note that the Bonferroni correction used by Jungreis And Kellis is the Taylor approximation to the Šidák correction when &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; is small). The Šidák correction is based on an assumption that the tests are independent. However, that is certainly not the case in the Córdoba study. For example, having at least one prognostic factor is one of the comorbidities tabulated. In other words, the p-value obtained is conservative. The calculation above uses n = 14, but Jungreis and Kellis reason that the number of tests is 30 = 15 × 2, to take into account an imbalance in either the treated or untreated direction. Here they are assuming two things: that two-sided tests for each comorbidity will produce double the p-value of a one-sided test, and that two sided tests are the “correct” tests to perform. They are wrong on both counts. First, the two-sided Fisher exact test does not, in general produce a p-value that is double the 1-sided test. The study result is a good example: 1/49 treated patients admitted to the ICU vs. 13/26 untreated patients produces a p-value of 7.7 ∗ 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; for both the 1-sided and 2-sided tests. Jungreis and Kellis do not seem to know this can happen, nor understand why; they go to great lengths to explain the importance of conducting a 1-sided test for the study result. Second, there is a strong case to be made that a 1-sided test is the correct test to perform for the comorbidities. The concern is not whether there was an imbalance of any sort, but whether the imbalance would skew results by virtue of the study including too many untreated individuals with comorbidities. In any case, if one were to give Jungreis and Kellis the benefit of the doubt, and perform a two sided test, the corrected p-value for the previous high blood pressure comorbidity is 0.06 and not 0.069.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most serious mistake that Jungreis and Kellis make, however, is in claiming that one can accept the null hypothesis of a hypothesis test when the p-value is greater than 0.05. The p-value they obtain is 0.069 which, even if it is taken at face value, is not grounds for claiming, as Jungreis and Kellis do, that “this is not significant evidence that the assignment was not random” and reason to conclude that there is “no evidence of incorrect randomization”. That is not how p-values work. A p-value less than 0.05 allows one to reject the null hypothesis (assuming 0.05 is the threshold chosen), but a p-value above the chosen threshold is not grounds for accepting the null. Moreover, the corrected p-value is 0.032 which is certainly grounds for rejecting the null hypothesis that the randomization was random.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Correction of the incorrect Jungreis and Kellis statistics may be a productive exercise in introductory undergraduate statistics for some, but it is pointless insofar as assessing the Córdoba study. While the extreme imbalance in the previous high blood pressure comorbidity is problematic because patients with the comorbidity may be more likely to get sick and require ICU admission, the study was so flawed that the exact p-value for the imbalance is a moot point. Given that the presence of comorbidities, not just their effect on patients, was a factor in determining which patients were admitted to the ICU, the extreme imbalance in the previous high blood pressure comorbidity renders the result of the study meaningless &lt;em&gt;ex facie&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A definition is not a theorem is not proof of efficacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an effort to fend off criticism that the comorbidities of patients were improperly balanced in the study, Jungreis and Kellis go further and present a “theorem” they claim shows that there was a minuscule chance that an uneven distribution of comorbidities could render the study results not significant. The “theorem” is stated twice in their paper, and I’ve copied both theorem statements verbatim from their paper:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem 1&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;In a randomized study, let p be the p-value of the study results, and let q be the probability that the randomization assigns patients to the control group in such a way that the values of P&lt;sub&gt;prognostic&lt;/sub&gt;(Patient) are sufficiently unevenly distributed between the treatment and control groups that the result of the study would no longer be statistically significant at the 95% level after p controlling for the prognostic risk factors. Then &lt;img alt=&quot;q &amp;lt; \frac{p}{0.05}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+%3C+%5Cfrac%7Bp%7D%7B0.05%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=545454&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; title=&quot;q &amp;lt; \frac{p}{0.05}&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Jungreis and Kellis, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;prognostic&lt;/sub&gt;(Patient)&lt;/em&gt; is the following: “There can be any number of prognostic risk factors, but if we knew what all of them were, and their effect sizes, and the interactions among them, we could combine their effects into a single number for each patient, which is the probability, based on all known and yet-to-be discovered risk factors at the time of hospital admission, that the patient will require ICU care if not given the calcifediol treatment. Call this (unknown) probability &lt;em&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;prognostic&lt;/sub&gt;(Patient)&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The theorem is restated in the Methods section of Jungreis and Kellis paper as follows:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem 2&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;In a randomized controlled study, let p be the p-value of the study outcome, and let q be the probability that the randomization distributes all prognostic risk factors combined sufficiently unevenly between the treatment and control groups that when controlling for these prognostic risk p factors the outcome would no longer be statistically significant at the 95% level. Then &lt;img alt=&quot;q &amp;lt; \frac{p}{0.05}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+%3C+%5Cfrac%7Bp%7D%7B0.05%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=545454&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; title=&quot;q &amp;lt; \frac{p}{0.05}&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While it is difficult to decipher the language the “theorem” is written in, let alone its meaning (note Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 are supposedly the same theorem), I was able to glean something about its content from reading the “proof”. The mathematical content of whatever the theorem is supposed to mean, is the definition of conditional probability, namely that if A and B are events with &lt;img alt=&quot;P(B) &amp;gt; 0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28B%29+%3E+0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=545454&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; title=&quot;P(B) &amp;gt; 0&quot; /&gt;, then&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;P(A|B) \quad := \quad \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28A%7CB%29+%5Cquad+%3A%3D+%5Cquad+%5Cfrac%7BP%28A+%5Ccap+B%29%7D%7BP%28B%29%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=545454&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; title=&quot;P(A|B) \quad := \quad \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be fair to Jungreis and Kellis, the “theorem” includes the observation that &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;P(A \cap B) \leq P(A) \quad \Rightarrow \quad P(A|B) \leq \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}.&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28A+%5Ccap+B%29+%5Cleq+P%28A%29+%5Cquad+%5CRightarrow+%5Cquad+P%28A%7CB%29+%5Cleq+%5Cfrac%7BP%28A%29%7D%7BP%28B%29%7D.&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=545454&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; title=&quot;P(A \cap B) \leq P(A) \quad \Rightarrow \quad P(A|B) \leq \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a “theorem”; it is literally the definition of conditional probability followed by an elementary inequality. The most generous interpretation of what Jungreis and Kellis were trying to do with this “theorem”, is that they were showing that the p-value for the study is so small, that it is small even after being multiplied by 20. There are less generous interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does Vitamin D intake reduce ICU admission?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of interest in Vitamin D and its effects on human health over the past decade [2], and much speculation about its relevance for COVID-19 susceptibility and disease severity. One interesting result on disease susceptibility was published recently: in a study of 489 patients, it was found that the relative risk of testing positive for COVID-19 was 1.77 times greater for patients with likely deficient vitamin D status compared with patients with likely sufficient vitamin D status [7]. However, definitive results on Vitamin D and its relationship to COVID- 19 will have to await larger trials. One such trial, a large randomized clinical trial with 2,700 individuals sponsored by Brigham and Women’s Hospital, is currently underway [4]. While this study might shed some light on Vitamin D and COVID-19, it is prudent to keep in mind that the outcome is not certain. Vitamin D levels are confounded with many socioeconomic factors, making the identification of causal links difficult. In the meantime, it has been suggested that it makes sense for individuals to maintain reference nutrient intakes of Vitamin D [6]. Such a public health recommendation is not controversial.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for Vitamin D administration to hospitalized COVID-19 patients reducing ICU admission, the best one can say about the Córdoba study is that nothing can be learned from it. Unfortunately, the poor study design, small sample size, availability of only summary statistics for the comorbidities, and imbalanced comorbidities among treated and untreated patients render the data useless. While it may be true that calcifediol administration to hospital patients reduces subsequent ICU admission, it may also not be true. Thus, the follow-up by Jungreis and Kellis is pointless at best. At worst, it is irresponsible propaganda, advocating for potentially dangerous treatment on the basis of shoddy arguments masked as “rigorous and well established statistical techniques”. It is surprising to see Jungreis and Kellis argue that it may be unethical to conduct a placebo randomized controlled trial, which is one of the most powerful tools in the development of safe and effective medical treatments. They write “the ethics of giving a placebo rather than treatment to a vitamin D deficient patient with this potentially fatal disease would need to be evaluated.” The evidence for such a policy is currently non-existent. On the other hand, there are plenty of known risks associated with excess Vitamin D [5].&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;From gulls to grouse to grackles, more than 10,000 bird species live on this planet. Now, scientists are one step closer to understanding the evolution of all of this feathered diversity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An international team of researchers has released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2873-9&quot;&gt;the genetic instruction books of 363 species of birds&lt;/a&gt;, including 267 genomes assembled for the first time. Comparing all of that genetic data can help scientists figure out how the varied traits of birds — from their diverse, spellbinding songs and courtship displays to their adaptations for flight — have evolved, the team says in the Nov. 12 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Birds have long received scientific attention, says ornithologist Michael Braun of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., one of the researchers involved in the project. “That’s partly because birds are relatively easy to see out in nature,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To compile some of the newly assembled genomes, the team took DNA from bird tissue samples in 17 scientific collections from around the world. Overall, the data cover roughly 92 percent of all modern bird families. Some species, such as chickens, are familiar; others are rare, such as the Henderson crake (&lt;em&gt;Zapornia atra&lt;/em&gt;), found only on remote Henderson Island in the South Pacific. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Scientists are just starting to uncover the secrets of avian evolution hidden in the genomes. Braun says that the data can be used better understand everything from the parallel evolution of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-emus-ostriches-birds-lost-ability-fly&quot;&gt;flightlessness in ratites like emus and kiwis&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: 4/4/19&lt;/em&gt;) to the evolution of vision and song learning in birds overall. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Already, the researchers have found peculiarities in the genomes of passerines — the order of songbirds that includes over half of all modern bird species, though the origin of this diversity is poorly understood. These alterations include the loss of a gene involved in the development of the vocal tract, possibly influencing passerines’ songs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This new information is the latest from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://b10k.genomics.cn/&quot;&gt;Bird 10,000 Genomes Project&lt;/a&gt;, but it won’t be the last. The international research collaboration doesn’t plan to stop assembling and releasing avian genomes until every last bird species on the planet is included.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Filling in the bird tree of life&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this chart, the bird family tree begins at the center (indicated with a star) and branches off to include the more than 10,000 living species. The points where two branches meet are called nodes. Birds with nearby nodes in common are closer relatives than birds connected by nodes that are farther apart. Marking which birds now have deciphered genomes on the avian tree of life (shown in purple, with selected sequenced species illustrated) reveals that birds from nearly every major branch are now included. Gray lines are unsequenced birds. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the included species are the golden eagle (illustrated at roughly noon on the chart), the little spotted kiwi (at 3:00), the wall creeper (at 6:00) and the Amazonian royal flycatcher (at 10:00).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The controversial idea that there are universals in the ways we use music received a boost in 2018, with the finding that people from 60 different countries &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/01/musical-universals-people-can-identify-lullabies-and-dance-songs-from-other-cultures/&quot;&gt;were pretty good at judging&lt;/a&gt; whether a totally unfamiliar piece of music from another culture was intended to soothe a baby or to be danced to. Now, new research involving some of the same team has revealed that foreign lullabies that babies have never heard before work to relax them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40859&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Constance M. Bainbridge and Mila Bertolo from Harvard University led the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-00963-z&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;, on 144 babies with an average age of 7 months. After being fitted with sensors to monitor their heart rate and level of sweating, each baby sat in a high chair or recliner or on its parent’s lap while watching animated characters lip-synching to 14-second bursts of songs. These songs came from the Natural History of Song Discography, a collection of songs from around the world, and eight were used as lullabies in the societies in which they were selected. The rest were intended to express love, heal the sick or be danced to. All of the songs were sung by solo vocalists, without background music.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As well as looking at the heart rate and skin sweating data, the team used video of the babies’ faces to monitor their pupil size. If these measures decreased, this would indicate that the baby was relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on some of these measures, at least, the team found that babies did indeed seem more relaxed during the lullabies than the other songs. “While heart rates dropped almost immediately following the onset of singing, regardless of song type, this drop was more pronounced during the lullabies,” the team writes. Whether the baby was 2 or 14 months old, the effect was the same, suggesting that it couldn’t simply be the result of exposure to music with age. The team also found that the babies’ pupils were smaller during the lullabies than the other songs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sweating results were less clear cut, however. These levels increased over the course of the experiment, perhaps because the babies were becoming more bored and fussy, the researchers suggest. But while a baby listened to a lullaby, this increase was temporarily slowed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What might explain these effects? The lullabies and the other songs certainly differed acoustically. The lullabies tended to be slower, and to have smaller pitch ranges and a less steady beat. As the researchers note, the earlier work on adults listening to unfamiliar songs found that the more a song was characterised by these specific features, the more confident a listener was that it was intended to be a lullaby. The team then compared these earlier adult ratings with their new results. And they found that the more that the adults had judged a song to be directed towards infants, the bigger the reduction in heart rate while the baby listened to it. “This result confirms that the acoustic effects of the songs drove the relaxation effects on them,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As they stress, the babies and their parents “were unfamiliar with the songs they heard, unfamiliar with the languages they were sung in and unfamiliar with the musical styles of the societies that originally produced the songs.” All the babies in the present study were American, but the researchers suspect that babies from other cultures would react in the same way. (In fact, they are now “eager to find out whether they do so”.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new work does open up some fascinating questions, such as: which of the acoustic features of lullabies are most important for the relaxation effect? And: do babies like lullabies more than other songs (or just find them more relaxing)? Also: what impact might lullabies have on a baby’s ongoing health? Numerous studies have found that music can help adults with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3782778/&quot;&gt;chronic pain&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5500733/&quot;&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, for example. “Music may also play an everyday role in improving health in infants,” the researchers write, “a role it has taken on across cultures and across human history.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-00963-z&quot;&gt;Infants relax in response to unfamiliar foreign lullabies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Hallucinogenic mushrooms’ key ingredient, psilocybin, can swiftly and dramatically ease depression in the right therapeutic setting, a small study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A month after receiving two doses of the psychedelic drug, 13 people &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2772630&quot;&gt;had big drops in depressive symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report November 4 in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the study was small and lacked participant diversity, it’s unclear whether the positive results would extend to wider populations. Still, “the current results are clear,” says Jay Olson, a psychology researcher at Harvard University who wasn’t involved in the study. “At least for some people, psilocybin can reduce depression better than several common treatment options.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Existing antidepressant drugs don’t work well for an estimated 30 to 50 percent of the people who try them; when they do work, the effects can take weeks to kick in. Psilocybin, a compound that can profoundly alter consciousness and perceptions of reality, might be a powerful alternative, says coauthor Roland Griffiths, a neuropsychopharmacologist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In the new study, patients with moderate or severe depression received two doses of psilocybin pills spaced about a week and a half apart. Participants also received therapy and support from researchers, before, during and after taking psilocybin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A comparison group of 11 people waited eight weeks, then also received the two doses of psilocybin and supportive therapy. This delay allowed the researchers to look for improvements in symptoms that were not related to the drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clinicians used a common depression rating scale consisting of 17 items to measure participants’ symptoms. Scores can range from 0 to 52, with higher numbers indicating more severe depression. Before receiving psilocybin, participants who got the drug without delay scored an average of 22.9 points, signaling the high end of moderate depression. Four weeks after the second dose, average scores dropped to 8.5. A score of 7 or below indicates no depression. Scores among the comparison group hovered around 23 while those people waited their turn to get the drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, 13 of 24 people — including those who got psilocybin immediately and those who got it later — met the definition of remission four weeks after their respective treatments. The drops in depression symptoms are substantial compared with those found by some analyses of standard antidepressants, Griffiths says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As with clinical studies in general, positive effects might arise simply from participants’ expectations, not the drug itself. But such effects are unlikely to account for the magnitude of the drop observed, Olson says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new findings on psilocybin’s antidepressant effects fit with earlier ones: A dose of the drug &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psilocybin-may-help-cancer-patients-depression-anxiety-years&quot;&gt;eased depression and anxiety in a small group of patients with cancer&lt;/a&gt;, effects that lasted for years in some cases, some of the same researchers reported in January (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/28/20&lt;/em&gt;). Another study, published in &lt;em&gt;Lancet Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; in 2016, found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27210031/&quot;&gt;signs of depression dropped&lt;/a&gt; in 12 people three months after two doses of psilocybin and psychological support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the approach is promising, Griffiths says, but questions remain. “We still need to collect more safety data and we need to know conditions for optimal administration,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other questions relate to who might benefit from the drug, and who might not, and a diverse study population could help address that. In the new study, however, almost all participants were white; there was just one Asian participant and one African-American participant. “We really need to think more about who we are including in these studies,” says psychologist Monnica Williams of the University of Ottawa, who wasn’t involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boosting participation rates among people of color calls for additional effort, particularly in the context of ongoing racial health disparities. A history of negative health care experiences might shape a psychedelic treatment experience, which is sensitive to the setting, Williams says. “A person of color might have a lot of reasons to feel very guarded and anxious in that situation, which is going to make it harder for that approach to be effective,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of 282 people who participated in psychedelic studies from 1993 to 2017, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-018-1824-6&quot;&gt;the vast majority — 82 percent — were white&lt;/a&gt;, Williams and colleagues reported in a review article published in 2018 in &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;. “We’re in the 21st century now,” she says. “There’s just no reason for this anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/11/16/climate-change-appeals-may-be-more-effective-when-theyre-pessimistic/"/>

		<updated>2020-11-16T16:50:39+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s no getting around the fact that climate change is an existential crisis of the highest order — but how best to communicate that threat is unclear. Too much pessimism and people become paralysed with anxiety, pushing thoughts about the crisis away altogether. Too much optimism, on the other hand, can lead to complacency — if things are going to be okay, why would we feel the need to engage with what’s going on?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s this tension that Brandi S. Morris and colleagues from Aarhus University explore in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00574-z&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Humanities and Social Sciences Communications. &lt;/em&gt;They suggest that climate change appeals with pessimistic endings could trigger higher engagement with the issue than those that end on an optimistic note.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40853&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 200 participants were presented with a transcript of a video about bees and climate change that had either an optimistic or pessimistic ending: in the optimistic condition, participants read that younger beekeepers were learning about and taking action on climate change, while in the pessimistic condition they read that bees were dying “at an alarming rate”. After this, they answered questions about their emotional response (e.g. how emotionally intense it had been to read the article), their beliefs in climate change (how much of a risk they feel it poses to human health), and their political ideology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants in the pessimistic condition felt that climate change was more of a risk than those in the optimistic condition, and also reported higher emotional arousal. There was a direct link between the two: the team found that reading the pessimistic ending triggered greater emotional arousal, which in turn led to greater risk perception. A second study in which participants actually viewed the videos as well as reading the transcripts found a very similar pattern of results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In both of these studies, people’s politics and worldview also played a part. Conservative participants reported lower levels of risk perception when their emotional arousal was low, as did people with a greater belief in individualism or hierarchy (as compared to collectivism or egalitarianism). But this also meant that emotional arousal triggered more of an increase in risk perception for these groups (compared to more liberal participants, whose risk perception was already high). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the third and final study, 1,115 participants again saw optimistic and pessimistic materials. This time a third “fatalistic” condition was added, in which participants were told that a reduction in the bee population would mean the “world would crumble” in a mere four years (“No matter what we do about climate change, it’s too late to turn things around”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After viewing this material, participants filled in the same risk perception and emotional arousal measures, and stated how much they agreed with the statement “I believe my actions have an influence on climate change”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants in both the pessimistic and fatalistic conditions reported higher emotional arousal. And the higher the level of arousal, the more likely a participant was to believe they can make an impact. Political ideology and worldview had similar effects as in the previous studies: belief in ability to change things was particularly low at lower levels of emotional arousal in moderates and conservatives, but increased considerably as a result of increased emotional arousal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that pessimistic messages about climate change may actually boost people’s beliefs that it is a problem and that they can do something to combat it. However, they also imply that those who are creating these kinds of interventions need to think carefully about who they’re aiming to reach and how they intend to do it: if different groups respond differently to positive or negative messaging, then a selection of carefully targeted messages might be more successful than something broader and designed to appeal to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, it’s important not to forget those parties who are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; responsible for acting on climate change: governments and corporations. While individuals can of course make a difference, it’s the big polluters who really have to change — according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/09/revealed-20-firms-third-carbon-emissions&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardian &lt;/em&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt;, just twenty fossil fuel companies are linked to a third of all greenhouse gas emissions. Figures like this make individual actions like turning off lights or recycling water bottles pale somewhat in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Designing successful interventions for climate action is key, and studies like this are an important part of making sure they work. But those designing them would do well to think about the limits of individual behaviour change — and who should really end up feeling responsible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00574-z&quot;&gt;Optimistic vs. pessimistic endings in climate change appeals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/DNA-music-notes-edited-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-03760-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; for BMC describing the use of sound to describe the function of the coronavirus genome. It was a perplexing article to write since I was toing and froing about science and art. I was writing a science article which had an art component to it. Was I creating a technical auditory display or was I creating something that was musical? I think I was actually doing both. I have since realised that I was adding an ‘A for Art’ into Science Technology Engineering and Maths to make STE(A)M. I made something that is both functional and creative. I thought if it didn’t sound good then people would not use it as a science tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst other things I have been making audio by copying the way a biological cell makes proteins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12158&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Temple, M.D. Real-time audio and visual display of the Coronavirus genome. BMC Bioinformatics 21, 431 (2020)&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12158&quot; height=&quot;282&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/temple_blog-300x282.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Temple, M.D. Real-time audio and visual display of the Coronavirus genome. BMC Bioinformatics 21, 431 (2020).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Temple, M.D. Real-time audio and visual display of the Coronavirus genome. BMC Bioinformatics 21, 431 (2020)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also created an animated display which is synchronised to the audio. The animation scrolls the genomic sequence across the page as if it was interacting with proteins inside a human cell. I did this because I want the user to see the sequence pass by as you hear the audio. Our eyes are attracted to things that move and we naturally listen for patterns in what we hear. I thought the combination of the two would be greater than either in isolation. The music is never going to replace a well-designed (but silent) &lt;a href=&quot;https://genome.ucsc.edu/&quot;&gt;genome browser&lt;/a&gt; but an audio track that is synchronised to a visual browser may help interpret the complex genomic sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/2U8pMNuOdJM&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/2U8pMNuOdJM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the music trying to say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of this discussion let’s assume that I have used the coronavirus genome to make instrumental music, since this is often what is assumed. So, the question now is, what is the music trying to say? If it were composed by a human it might say something about the human condition in response to the virus. But the music was composed by a computer algorithm from the genomic sequence and therefore it tells us something about the function of the genome. It tells us something about how the genome is used to make proteins (translation) and how it makes new copies of itself (transcription).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imagine you are inside a human cell.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the music, you need to imagine that you are inside a human cell, you are a machine (such as a ribosome complex) moving along the viral genomic RNA sequence and converting it into a protein sequence, like a train running down a track. The music of translation begins at a slow tempo whilst we listen to an untranslated region. As we run into a gene sequence, another instrument starts to play the sound of a new protein being made and the music picks tempo up. Occasionally the music pauses in silence as we pass a cleavage point in a coronavirus protein. Almost randomly, syncopated high pitched notes sound out as we pass important regions called stop codons. Conversely, the effect of a start codon may be heard for many minutes after the text sequence has scrolled off the screen. The sound of these and other genomic attributes gives a narrative to the music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are to use colors, shapes and font styles to tell us something about the sequence, then why not use music to tell us this is a new way? The fact that music has a beginning, middle and end is important since this makes us think about the order of features in the genome and this is important to understand their function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the sound musical in its own right? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For days after I submitted the manuscript for review I had the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/a-viral-hit-the-sequence-of-coronavirus-makes-surprisingly-lovely-music-147905&quot;&gt;‘so c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/a-viral-hit-the-sequence-of-coronavirus-makes-surprisingly-lovely-music-147905&quot;&gt;alled music’&lt;/a&gt; of the coronavirus genome in my head. I was wondering if other people would also consider it musical. Music can be inspiring, it should be creative and it can stir human emotion. In contrast, the sound of the coronavirus genome is minimal, repetitive and systematic. To make genomic data more musical I thought I should add some musicians into the mix. Literally!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A musician friend of mine (Mike Anderson) and I went into the music studio. We played the sound of the coronavirus genome very loudly over a big sound system. We set up drums and a loud guitar amp and we played along with the sequence. I made a simple recording of this and called it Coronacode music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/2sG9O300Oz0&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/2sG9O300Oz0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After producing Coronacode music it made me think more about generative music (from a computer) versus musical improvisation. When we played along to the code it restricted what we were able to play and this constraint was a source of creativity. It snapped us out of our usual musical patterns and made us play something new. The repeating nucleotides A, U, G and C combine with the repeating drum pattern of kick, snare, tom, kick! Long guitar tones soften the incessant pulse of the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing up in public.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach is new to me. I think the use of sound to convey patterns in scientific data (sonification) has not yet come of age. Anecdotally I would say there is still skepticism within the scientific community regarding the value of sound. However, since computer browsers are now more capable to process data into audio and visuals I think we will see more instances of its application. If the audio and visual displays are tightly coupled and work together in harmony, then I think it will not only sound good but it will be more informative.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;On the heels of the preliminary success of one COVID-19 vaccine in the United States, another leading vaccine candidate is showing promise. Preliminary results indicate that Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-pfizer-effective-early-trial-data&quot;&gt;is nearly 95 percent effective in preventing sickness&lt;/a&gt;, including severe cases of the disease, the biotechnology company announced November 16.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “This is a pivotal moment in the development of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a news release. The results are the “first clinical validation that our vaccine can prevent COVID-19 disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only last week, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer and German biotech company BioNTech announced that their coronavirus vaccine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-pfizer-effective-early-trial-data&quot;&gt;is more than 90 percent effective&lt;/a&gt; in preventing people from getting sick from the virus (&lt;em&gt;SN: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;11/9/20&lt;/em&gt;). If both vaccines continue to do well in clinical trials, the United States could soon have two coronavirus vaccines available for those most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both Moderna and Pfizer plan to submit applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the coming weeks to allow emergency use of their vaccines.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The new Moderna results are based on an analysis of 95 coronavirus cases that have occurred so far during the company’s Phase III clinical trial of the vaccine. Researchers began counting who fell ill at least two weeks after participants received a second vaccine dose. Of the cases, 90 were in people who received a placebo and five were in the vaccinated group, making the vaccine 94.5 percent effective. The data are preliminary and have yet to be peer reviewed by other scientists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The FDA recommends that COVID-19 vaccines have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-what-does-covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-mean&quot;&gt;at least 50 percent efficacy&lt;/a&gt;, meaning a vaccine should reduce COVID-19 cases in vaccinated people compared with a placebo by half (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/4/20&lt;/em&gt;). Both Moderna and Pfizer’s clinical trials are ongoing so the final efficacy of the vaccines could change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear how well Moderna’s vaccine performs in different age or racial groups, though the results do include some older participants as well as people of different racial backgrounds. Of those who got sick, 15 of the 95 cases were in people older than 65. Another 20 cases were in Hispanic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-why-african-americans-vulnerable-covid-19-health-race&quot;&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt;, Asian or multiracial participants — groups that have been disproportionately hard-hit during the pandemic (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/10/20&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the new results hint that the vaccine may prevent people from developing severe disease if they do get infected with the virus. In the clinical trial so far, 11 people have fallen severely ill, all of whom had received the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s encouraging to see early results that suggest that the vaccine can decrease disease severity, says Nina Luning Prak, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania. “That’s still a small number, but it’s 11 out of 11 versus zero on the other side.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moderna, based in Cambridge, Mass., and the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., worked together to develop the vaccine. Previous work showed that the vaccine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-moderna-vaccine-immune-response-people&quot;&gt;sparks an immune response&lt;/a&gt; in people who receive it (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/18/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By October 22, 30,000 participants had been &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-completes-enrollment-phase-3-cove-study-mrna-vaccine&quot;&gt;enrolled in the company’s late-stage clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;, though thousands of people still needed to receive both shots, which are given one month apart.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that the vaccine is safe. People in the trial have reported mild to moderate side effects after the second injection, including fatigue, joint pain and headache. There have not been any severe reactions. Moderna plans to follow participants for two years to more completely monitor the vaccine’s safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both Moderna and Pfizer’s vaccines rely on messenger RNA, or mRNA, a genetic molecule that cellular machinery “reads” to build proteins inside cells. For these vaccines, the mRNA contains instructions for building the coronavirus’ spike protein, which helps the virus enter human cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vaccines induce human cells to make the spike protein, and the immune system then makes antibodies to latch onto the spike proteins. Those vaccine-stimulated antibodies may prevent the real virus from infecting healthy cells in the future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No vaccine using such mRNA technology has ever been used in people. If such vaccines prove successful, that could expedite the vaccine-making process. “That’s one of the strengths of the platform,” Luning Prak says. “Within a matter of essentially minutes, you could basically design a vaccine.” That’s because these vaccines don’t rely on laboratory-grown cells to produce millions of doses like other types of vaccines do. All researchers need is the genetic code for a particular viral protein, such as the spike protein. Although choosing the right protein out of many possibilities to generate the best immune response may still prove tricky, mRNA vaccines “clearly have promise,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine must be kept frozen at an ultracold –70° Celsius (–94° Fahrenheit), making its distribution potentially difficult. Moderna’s vaccine, however, can remain stable at refrigerated temperatures — between 2° to 8° C or 36° to 46° F — for 30 days, the company said in the Nov. 16 news release. That could help allocate COVID-19 vaccines in areas without easy access to dry ice or specialized freezers needed for Pfizer’s vaccine.  &lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planets-many-neighbors-may-be-best-places-look-life"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for life beyond the solar system, there’s strength in numbers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that systems with multiple planets tend to have rounder orbits than those with just one, indicating a calmer family history. Only child systems and planets with more erratic paths hint at past planetary sibling clashes violent enough to knock orbits askew, or even lead to banishment. A long-lasting abundance of sibling planets might therefore have protected Earth from destructive chaos, and may be part of what made life on Earth possible, says astronomer Uffe Gråe Jørgensen of the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Is there something other than the Earth’s size and position around the star that is necessary in order for life to develop?” Jørgensen says. “Is it required that there are many planets?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of the 4,000-plus exoplanets discovered to date have elongated, or eccentric, orbits. That marks a striking difference from the neat, circular orbits of the planets in our solar system. Rather than being an oddity, those round orbits are actually perfectly &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnras/staa3321/5944142&quot;&gt;normal — for a system with so many planets packed together&lt;/a&gt;, Jørgensen and his Niels Bohr colleague Nanna Bach-Møller report in a paper  published online October 30 in the &lt;em&gt;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Bach-Møller and Jørgensen analyzed the eccentric paths of 1,171 exoplanets orbiting 895 different stars. The duo found a tight correlation between number of planets and orbit shape. The more planets a system has, the more circular their orbits, no matter where you look or what kind of star they orbit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier, smaller studies also saw a correlation between number of planets and orbit shapes, says astrophysicist Diego Turrini of the Italian National Astrophysics Institute in Rome. Those earlier studies used only a few hundred planets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a very important confirmation,” Turrini says. “It is providing us an idea of … how likely it is there will be no fight in the family, no destructive events, and your planetary system will remain as it formed … long enough to produce life.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Systems with as many planets as ours are exceedingly rare, though. Only one known system comes close: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seven-earth-sized-planets-orbit-nearby-supercool-star&quot;&gt;TRAPPIST-1 system&lt;/a&gt;, with seven roughly Earth-sized worlds (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/22/17&lt;/em&gt;). Astronomers have found no planetary systems so far, other than ours, with eight or more planets. Extrapolating out to the number of stars expected to have planets in the galaxy, Jørgensen estimates that about 1 percent of planetary systems have as many planets as we do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not unique, but the solar system belongs to a rare type of planetary system,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That could help explain why life seems to be rare in the galaxy, Jørgensen suggests. Exoplanet studies indicate that there are billions of worlds the same size as Earth, whose orbits would make them good places for liquid water. But just being in the so-called “habitable zone” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-just-being-habitable-zone-doesnt-make-exoplanets-livable&quot;&gt;is not enough to make a planet habitable&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/4/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If there are so many planets where we could in principle live, why are we not teeming with UFOs all the time?” Jørgensen says. “Why do we not get into traffic jams with UFOs?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The answer might lie in the different histories of planetary systems with eccentric and circular orbits. Theories of solar system formation predict that most planets are born in a disk of gas and dust that encircles a young star. That means young planets should have circular orbits, and all orbit in the same plane as the disk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You want the planets to not come too close to each other, otherwise their interactions might destabilize the system,” says Torrini. “The more planets you have the more delicate the equilibrium is.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Planets that end up on elliptical orbits may have gotten there via violent encounters with neighboring planets, whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-collisions-may-have-rearranged-crowded-solar-systems&quot;&gt;direct collisions&lt;/a&gt; that break both planets apart or near-misses that toss the planets about (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/27/15&lt;/em&gt;). Some of those encounters may have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/solo-planets-may-be-surprisingly-common&quot;&gt;ejected planets from their planetary systems altogether&lt;/a&gt;, possibly explaining why planets with eccentric orbits have fewer siblings (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/20/15&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earth’s survival may therefore have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/roaming-giants-did-migrating-planets-shape-solar-system&quot;&gt;depended on its neighbors playing nice&lt;/a&gt; for billions of years (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/25/05&lt;/em&gt;). It doesn’t need to have escaped violence altogether, either, Jørgensen says. One popular theory holds that Jupiter and Saturn shifted in their orbits billions of years ago, a reshuffling that knocked the orbits of distant comets askew and send them careening into the inner solar system. Several lines of evidence suggest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-did-earth-get-its-water&quot;&gt;comets could have brought water to the early Earth&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/6/15&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not the Earth that is important,” Jørgensen says. “It’s the whole configuration of the planetary system that’s important for life to originate on an earthlike planet.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/essential-genes-fast-evolution-junk-dna-heterochromatin-genetics"/>

		<updated>2020-11-16T11:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A long-standing puzzle in evolution is why new genes — ones that seem to arise out of nowhere — can quickly take over functions essential for an organism’s survival.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study in fruit flies may help solve that puzzle. It shows that some new genes quickly become crucial because they regulate a type of DNA called heterochromatin. Once considered “junk DNA,” heterochromatin actually performs many important jobs, including acting like a tightly guarded prison: It locks up “bad actor” genes, preventing them from turning on and doing damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Heterochromatin is also one of the fastest-changing bits of DNA in the body, so the genes that regulate it have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/63368&quot;&gt;adapt quickly just to keep up&lt;/a&gt;, evolutionary biologist Harmit Malik at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and his colleagues report online November 10 in &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The work is a milestone,” said Manyuan Long, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago who was not involved in the research. “It is really amazing seeing such an important role the heterochromatin plays in gene evolution.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Scientists have documented many cases of genes that seem to arise from scratch and give an organism a new ability. For instance, one such gene in fish makes a novel antifreeze protein; another in flies is essential for flight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About a decade ago, researchers discovered that new genes don’t just confer new functions; some may actually be necessary for survival. In the fruit fly &lt;em&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/em&gt;, as many as 30 percent of essential genes are “new,” with some arising as recently as 3 million years ago — a flash in evolutionary timescales. The discovery overturned a long-held belief that important genes don’t really change much over the course of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Malik’s team investigated a large family of genes in fruit flies that regulate other genes — turning them on and off for various tasks in the cell. It found that within the family of 70 or so genes, the genes that were evolving more rapidly were more likely to control essential functions for the fly. In fact, 67 percent of rapidly evolving genes were essential compared with 20 percent in the slower-evolving group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The dogma is completely opposite than what you would expect,” said Malik.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that one of the new essential genes, dubbed &lt;em&gt;Nicknack, &lt;/em&gt;issues instructions for a protein that binds to heterochromatin, although the details remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To see how quickly &lt;em&gt;Nicknack&lt;/em&gt; might have taken over an essential function, the researchers replaced the &lt;em&gt;Nicknack&lt;/em&gt; gene in &lt;em&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/em&gt; with the &lt;em&gt;Nicknack&lt;/em&gt; gene in its closest evolutionary relative, &lt;em&gt;D. simulans&lt;/em&gt;. The two species of flies split into two branches of the fruit fly tree roughly 2.5 million years ago. Scientists would typically expect the &lt;em&gt;Nicknack &lt;/em&gt;gene of S. &lt;em&gt;simulans&lt;/em&gt; to be basically the same as the one in &lt;em&gt;D.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;melanogaster&lt;/em&gt;,because it is essential and therefore wouldn’t have changed much over the short span (in evolutionary terms) of a couple million years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They tested this theory by swapping the gene from &lt;em&gt;D.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;simulans&lt;/em&gt; into the &lt;em&gt;D.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;melanogaste&lt;/em&gt;r fly, expecting that if the genes were the same, the trade would have no effect. But instead, the female flies survived the swap just fine, but all the males died. Malik thinks the difference between the sexes has to do with heterochromatin: The Y chromosome contains a lot of it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s as if [&lt;em&gt;D.&lt;/em&gt;] &lt;em&gt;simulans’&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;Nicknack&lt;/em&gt; gene] comes in with its hand tied behind its back,” Malik says. “It’s good enough to do its function in female flies, but in male flies, where there is a huge block of heterochromatin, it can’t.” In other words, the gene from one species is no match for its counterpart in the other.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result suggests that in the 2.5 million years since the two species split, &lt;em&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/em&gt; evolved its own version of &lt;em&gt;Nicknack&lt;/em&gt;. And because the swap adversely affected the males, with their abundance of heterochromatin in the Y chromosome, the researchers concluded that &lt;em&gt;Nicknack&lt;/em&gt; must play some crucial role in regulating heterochromatin. And since heterochromatin evolves so rapidly, the &lt;em&gt;Nicknack&lt;/em&gt; gene has to evolve rapidly too, so it doesn’t become obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, Malik hopes to do more studies to understand the exact function of &lt;em&gt;Nicknack&lt;/em&gt;. That may help shed light on heterochromatin’s role in shaping the speed and course of evolution. Scientists, he says, are just at the beginning of understanding the many ways this “junk DNA” is anything but junk.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Measles has come back with a vengeance around the world in recent years, wiping out steep declines in cases seen since the start of the new century.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From 2000 to 2016, reported measles cases worldwide plunged from 853,479 to 132,490. Cases &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-reported-measles-cases-jumped-31-percent-2017-cdc&quot;&gt;began to rise again&lt;/a&gt; after that (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/30/18&lt;/em&gt;). In 2019, a reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6945a6.htm?s_cid=mm6945a6_w&quot;&gt;869,770 people had measles, the most since 1996&lt;/a&gt;, according to a study by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published online November 12 in &lt;em&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, the estimated number of deaths from measles in 2019 was 207,500, up close to 50 percent since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a really important setback and a tragic setback, because we’ve had a safe and effective measles vaccine since the early 1960s,” says William Moss, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who was not involved in the report. “We had made enormous progress.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine is a public health superstar, with the recommended two doses about 97 percent effective at preventing the disease and one dose about 93 percent effective. To stop outbreaks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/us-measles-outbreaks-not-slowing-down-vaccines&quot;&gt;around 95 percent of a community&lt;/a&gt; must be vaccinated (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/15/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, measles is infecting more people because of stalled progress in increasing immunization coverage, says coauthor Natasha Crowcroft, a senior advisor for WHO’s Measles and Rubella Control in Geneva. Globally, estimated coverage with the first dose of a measles vaccine rose from 72 to 84 percent from 2000 to 2010, but has since leveled off to around 84 to 85 percent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This “is high enough to slow measles or interrupt it for periods of time, but it inevitably leads to the accumulation of susceptible children, and eventually this flares up into outbreaks,” says Crowcroft. In 2019, 19.8 million infants did not receive the first dose of a measles vaccine. The reasons for low coverage vary by region, but weak primary health care systems and access are major factors, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Large outbreaks in nine countries — Central African Republic, Congo, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Madagascar, North Macedonia, Samoa, Tonga and Ukraine — were responsible for 73 percent of the reported 2019 cases. The study highlights issues that befell a few of these nations. Congo and Madagascar have many children vulnerable to measles because of very &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/us-measles-cases-record-high-disease-eliminated-2000&quot;&gt;low vaccination coverage&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/24/19&lt;/em&gt;). More people in Samoa shied away from the measles vaccine after two babies died because of a medical error made when they were immunized in 2018. In Ukraine, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/measles-global-spread-vaccination&quot;&gt;lack of confidence in vaccines&lt;/a&gt; by health care workers is one reason fewer people there are vaccinated (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/21/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The WHO groups the world into six regions; all of them struggled with measles. The Americas had 19,244 reported measles cases in 2019, with major outbreaks in Brazil and the United States, which last year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/measles-cases-low-vaccination-rates-top-science-stories-2019-yir&quot;&gt;nearly lost its claim to having eliminated measles&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/16/19&lt;/em&gt;). There were 618,595 people reported to have measles in the African region in 2019, and 105,755 in the European region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic may add to the challenges ahead in reigning in measles. “Given all the issues that led to 2019, we are not starting from a strong base,” says Crowcroft. Disruptions to immunization programs could produce more gaps in immunity to measles, heightening the risk of outbreaks. The economic hardship brought on by the pandemic has also increased malnutrition, she says, which makes the disease worse; vitamin A deficiency in particular is associated with severe measles. “These issues tend to cluster in the same communities, exacerbating the total effect and increasing inequity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Increasing the number of children who receive the recommended two doses of measles vaccine and implementing catch-up vaccination for those who miss shots are a few of the actions needed to regain control of measles, Crowcroft and her coauthors write. “It takes a lot of careful work and support at multiple levels in a country to create a strong immunization program,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually, it may be possible to expand vaccination around the world with the help of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/getting-flu-shot-could-soon-be-easy-sticking-band-aid&quot;&gt;vaccine patch&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;6/28/17&lt;/em&gt;). The single-dose patches have an array of tiny “needles” that are filled or coated with the vaccine; in some cases, the needles dissolve into the skin. Animal studies have found the patches to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196331/&quot;&gt;effective as a measles vaccine delivery device&lt;/a&gt;. The patches don’t have the same cold temperature requirements for storage that the syringe-based measles vaccine does, says Moss, and the adhesive-backed patches can be administered with minimal training.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s still a number of years away,” he says. But being able to stick a patch on a child and immunize them “is going to be perhaps transformative and really help us boost measles vaccine coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/technology-natural-hazards-natech-disasters-lightning-wildfire"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3093355</id>
		<updated>2020-11-13T15:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;In August, a dry lightning storm over California sparked an intense wildfire that raged through communities in the Santa Cruz mountains. After the CZU Lightning Complex Fire was contained, local officials advised some residents returning to their homes to not use the drinking water. Benzene, a known carcinogen, had been detected in the water supply. The chemical probably was released by plastic pipes that melted during the fire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists call events like this “natech,” or natural hazard-induced technological disasters. Coined in 1994, the term originally applied to industrial incidents such as chemical or fuel spills that occur after hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural hazards. But natech’s definition has recently expanded, says resilience scientist David Yu of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. It now covers any disaster arising from damage caused by a natural hazard to infrastructure that relies on technology, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That includes disasters involving electricity and water supply. Finding&lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://awwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aws2.1183&quot;&gt;benzene in drinking water after wildfires&lt;/a&gt; is a perfect example, Yu says. Natech now also encompasses disasters that have the potential to cause humanitarian crises, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japan-struggles-control-earthquake-damaged-nuke-plant&quot;&gt;the 2011 Fukushima nuclear reactor disaster&lt;/a&gt; in Japan, which was caused by a magnitude 9 earthquake and ensuing tsunami (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/14/11&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The frequency of natech is increasing worldwide, according to a study in the 2018 &lt;em&gt;Handbook of Disaster Research.&lt;/em&gt; More people are moving to coasts and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/development-near-natural-areas-puts-more-californians-path-wildfires&quot;&gt;the edges of wilderness areas&lt;/a&gt;, places vulnerable to natural hazards, especially hurricanes and wildfires (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/15/18&lt;/em&gt;). It takes power plants, water supply facilities and networks of fiber-optic internet cables to support these growing population centers. With climate change predicted to fuel more frequent and intense hazards, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/u-s-power-grid-desperately-needs-upgrades-handle-climate-change&quot;&gt;these natural events will collide with vital infrastructure &lt;/a&gt;more often (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/12/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Natech usually harms the environment but doesn’t typically cause human deaths or injuries. While the damage is hard to quantify in dollars, &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-63254-4_3&quot;&gt;the ripple effects are reaching further than ever before&lt;/a&gt;, note sociologists Duane Gill of Oklahoma State University in Stillwater and Liesel Ritchie of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg in the &lt;em&gt;Handbook of Disaster Research&lt;/em&gt;. That’s because the world is more connected than it was 26 years ago. Natech, the pair write, “reveals the social embeddedness of all hazards, risks and disasters.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recent study finds political differences in how much stock people put in expert evidence versus personal experience. &lt;/strong&gt;Liberals tend to see evidence from experts as more legitimate, while conservatives place more equal value on both, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/conservatives-value-personal-stories-more-than-liberals-do-when-evaluating-scientific-evidence-149132&quot;&gt;write the researchers Randy Stein, Alexander Swan and Michelle Sarraf&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;.  This was true even though the scenarios in the study were completely apolitical, the team adds, suggesting that the findings pick up on fundamental differences in worldview between the two camps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40841&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spitefulness can be antisocial and nasty — but does it also have benefits? &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/08/is-it-ever-good-to-be-spiteful&quot;&gt;Jamie Waters looks at&lt;/a&gt; a new book on the “upside” of spite by Simon McCarthy-Jones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More this week on the effectiveness — or lack thereof — of unconscious bias training&lt;/strong&gt;. Companies spend billions on such training every year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/unconscious-bias-diversity-fix&quot;&gt;writes Allyssia Alleyne&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, yet there’s little evidence that it works to change people’s behaviour. And worse, it can allow organisations to appear to be doing something to improve diversity and inclusion, while avoiding putting in the time and resources to achieve real change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To what extent is our conceptualisation of “forgiveness” held by other people around the world?&lt;/strong&gt; At &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201109-what-other-cultures-can-teach-us-about-forgiveness&quot;&gt;William Park has an interesting exploration&lt;/a&gt; of the cultural and linguistic differences that determine how we forgive others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A portion of Covid-19 patients who have recovered report experiencing a mental fuzziness, or “brain fog”. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/confused-about-covid-brain-fog-doctors-have-questions-too/&quot;&gt;Sara Harrison examines&lt;/a&gt; what we know so far about these lingering cognitive effects at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the last few years a wealth of evidence has suggested that psychedelic drugs may help to treat particular mental health conditions.&lt;/strong&gt; At &lt;em&gt;Popular Science&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsci.com/story/health/psilocybin-hallucinogens-spiritual-science/&quot;&gt;Sarah Scoles reports on work&lt;/a&gt; which suggests those effects may be particularly strong when people have a “mystical” experience while on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bolivia-indigenous-tsimane-people-average-body-temperature"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Indigenous Bolivian Amazon dwellers are helping to bolster recent findings that normal body temperature, around 37° Celsius, or 98.6° Fahrenheit, might not be so normal anymore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The horticulturist-forager Tsimane people in the South American nation &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/44/eabc6599&quot;&gt;have experienced a half-degree drop, on average, in body temperatures&lt;/a&gt; over a decade and a half, anthropologist Michael Gurven and colleagues report October 28 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new finding echoes the half-degree drop in average body temperature reported earlier this year in a Stanford University study of three U.S. population cohorts over 157 years. In that research, normal body temperature fell by 0.03° C per decade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Body temperature serves as a sort of surrogate for basal metabolic rate, or the number of calories required to keep the body working while at rest. Higher rates have been linked to shorter life spans and lower body mass. Body temperature — which also reflects &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cracking-body-clock-code-wins-trio-nobel-prize&quot;&gt;circadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt;, immune function, the presence or absence of disease as well as ambient temperature — is affected by age, sex and time of day (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/2/17&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;More than a matter of curiosity, lower temperatures could be indicative of a change in basic human physiology, says Jill Waalen, an epidemiologist at the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, Calif., who was not involved with either study. And this could mean a rethinking of what constitutes a fever — a timely question, given the use of temperature checks to screen for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Improved lifestyles and access to medical care have reduced overall rates of infectious disease and inflammation, and could be the reason for the temperature dips. But making that link definitively has proven difficult, says Gurven, of the University of California, Santa Barbara.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 37° C normal was derived in the mid-1800s by physician Carl Wunderlich based on his study of about 25,000 Germans. More recent studies, in addition to the Stanford study, suggest that today &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/49555&quot;&gt;average body temperature runs lower&lt;/a&gt;. Those studies, however, have largely focused on populations in relatively wealthy countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the new research focuses on Indigenous people living in the Bolivian Amazon. The Tsimane people live in villages without running water or electricity, and subsist largely on rice, plantains and the starchy root vegetable manioc. Rapid community changes over the last few decades include increased access to store-bought foods and antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;members of Indigenous Tsimane people in Bolivia fishing using bow and arrow&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3093338&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/110420_sg_bodytemp_inline1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3093338&quot;&gt;Though the lifestyles of the Indigenous Tsimane people in Bolivia have modernized over the last few decades, group members still consume a mostly traditional diet of plantains, manioc and meat from hunting. Here, a father and son fish using a bow and arrow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3093338&quot;&gt;M. Gurven&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gurven, who codirects the Tsimane Health and Life History Project, and colleagues examined 17,958 temperature measurements from 5,481 Tsimane teens and adults, and found that the half-degree average body temperature drop had taken just 16 years — from 2002 to 2018. The reason for the drop is harder to pin down. It could be based on inflammation levels or infection rates and even ambient temperature on any given day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The paper was an opportunity to explore everything that’s been going on [in this group] over the last 20 years,” Gurven says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To find a cause for the decrease, the team looked at several variables related to ambient temperature and health, including trends in respiratory illnesses or parasitic infections over time. Respiratory illnesses among the Tsimane people declined over time, the team found, but other health conditions such as parasitic infections and blood disease remained common. Overall, the researchers did not find a connection between the decrease in average body temperature and any individual variable or combination of variables.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gurven and colleagues still suspect that the lower average body temperature could have arisen as a result of increased access to medications, such as painkillers or antibiotics, or better nutrition, though more research will be needed to show that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even without a clear explanation, this growing body of evidence suggests that normal body temperature might be more appropriately viewed as a range that varies from person to person, not as a fixed value across the population, says infectious disease specialist Waleed Javaid of the Mount Sinai Downtown health network in New York City. Studies like the Bolivia research, he notes, could help public health experts develop a new range of normal body temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clouds may be ecosystems&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/environmental-sciences-4&quot;&gt;Science News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, November 14, 1970&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clouds in the sky may contain living microbial ecosystems…. [Research] determined that metabolic activity, in the form of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake into organic material, occurred in [airborne] dust over a 24-hour period, whereas it did not occur in sterilized control dust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Update&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere is rich in microbial life. One census documented some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5549752/#__ffn_sectitle&quot;&gt;28,000 bacterial species&lt;/a&gt; in samples of water from clouds above a mountain in France, scientists reported in 2017. Research building over the last decade or so has supported the claim that some bacteria may indeed be metabolically active within their hazy abodes. One species of &lt;em&gt;B­acillus&lt;/em&gt;, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microbes-floating-among-clouds-may-munch-sugar&quot;&gt;eats sugar&lt;/a&gt; floating in the atmosphere to build a coating — perhaps to shield itself from ultraviolet radiation and low temperatures (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/7/15, p. 5&lt;/em&gt;). Some scientists suspect cloud bacteria contribute to Earth’s carbon and nitrogen cycles, and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/germy-chance-hail&quot;&gt;influence weather&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/18/11, p. 12&lt;/em&gt;). The microbes can spur ice crystals to form, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/microbes-may-sky-jump-new-hosts&quot;&gt;triggering rain and snow&lt;/a&gt; — and a ride back to Earth’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-one/&quot;&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;/em&gt;Music and Autism: Speaking for Ourselves &lt;em&gt;author Michael Bakan’s interview with his Chapter 7 musician co-author Graeme Gibson (who is on the spectrum) and Graeme’s parents, the renowned science fiction novelist William (Bill) Gibson and autism researcher Dr Deborah Gibson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;things left off with Bill telling Michael about how being Graeme’s dad had influenced his creation of “unnervingly human” AI (Artificial Intelligence) characters in his novels. Next in the conversation, Michael invited Bill to talk about the very significant influence of music generally—and specific musicians in particular—on his creative process as a writer. We pick up the conversation from that point.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael (M):&lt;/strong&gt; That’s really interesting [to learn how being Graeme’s father inspired your “humanization” of AI characters in your books], Bill, and leads me to another question, specifically having to do with how music has influenced you as a writer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill (B):&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I’m not at all musical, and neither is Deb, but we have both in our lives been very, very intensely moved by music. I’m just kind of a folk and pop guy (Deb’s tastes are broader; she has a library of operas), but yes, music has influenced me greatly as a writer. When I was starting to write, around age twelve or thirteen, I loved science fiction and read a great whack of it. But then, you know, puberty arrived, and I thought it was like a childhood thing and put it on the side. But when I began to think about writing again, I was dismayed by how uncool, to my mind, the science fiction that was being produced in the late ‘70s, early ‘80s, was. I thought it had become like Nashville country: formulaic, nothing there that I would be interested in. And what I wanted science fiction to be, as I thought, was more like Dylan going electric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I was more consciously inspired by Steely Dan’s lyrics than I was by any of the science fiction that I could see being written when I first started to write. Then I found there were other people around trying for the same effect, other writers whose science fiction &lt;em&gt;looked &lt;/em&gt;more like Steely Dan’s lyrics than the rest of the science fiction that was written… And when I started going to London on publishing-related business, the best science fiction store in town was right across the street from the studios where David Bowie recorded his first three or four albums. And the people in the stores—they would have loved David Bowie anyways—but they particularly loved him because he’d always been one of their very best customers, since before he started recording. And they could see that he was taking what he was buying from them, taking it home, fully digesting it, and bringing it back into the recording studio. So that’s an art of sound thing in its own way. I love it that I know that story and that I know it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M:&lt;/strong&gt; So do you feel that there’s some similar kind of process, specifically relative to music, that went on in your own writing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; No, it was more like an ambition that there could be an analogy, and I knew that some of the most progressive science fiction being written when I was fourteen years old was being written by people who were already being inspired by the roots of the music of what we think of as the ‘60s. But their influence had faded away by the time I came back in my mid-twenties after getting a BA in English literature, and I was looking at contemporary science fiction and going, “Oh, man. This is not happening for me.” So my ambition was to, you know, make that analogy happen again… I remember listening to Bruce Springsteen’s “Nebraska” and imagining what it would be like if it were a science fiction novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: &lt;/strong&gt;That was what I would do. I would listen to a piece of music and it would really move me and be unlike anything quite like what I’d heard before. And I’d think, “Yeah, but what would that be like if it were a piece of science fiction? What would that look like as a piece of science fiction?” And that would be a starting point for something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Eg1aF5qKfJg.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Bill with Graeme reading. Photo by Dr Deborah Gibson, used with permission.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M:&lt;/strong&gt; Fascinating! Over to you, Deborah. What essential lessons has being Graeme’s mom taught you, and how have those lessons impacted your life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; So one of the things I learned, I guess &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to learn, was that we had to create our own experience and ways to get Graeme his best life, and ways for us to get through it without going completely berserk &lt;em&gt;[laughter]. &lt;/em&gt;It was hard because there wasn’t the level of support that there is now, and we were, like, very impoverished really—well, not really—but we were very low income earners at the time. So it was difficult, but I managed, and I realized that I had to get another persona in order to find out what I wanted to know about Graeme, because every test that he had, everything that I pushed for, they would just give me the “mom” version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I knew there was another version that went amongst the professionals, that would use medical vocabulary and such. I needed to learn it, and I did learn it (that knowledge base eventually became the foundation for my PhD dissertation research, in fact, which was a case study on Graeme’s language acquisition) and I was able, therefore, to push quite far into getting information about Graeme that made me then feel like I had the information to take to, say, the school board or medical world, and to ask for things that were not there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, Graeme was the first child with autism that that was integrated into the Vancouver School Board, to not be in a segregated class. And so I think just having a child who was “different” pushed me in a way that I was unwillingly pushed, but that nonetheless was an important maturation. I had a very cute baby, and one that was enchantingly different from others I knew. And it was delightful! Graeme’s babyhood was not all difficulties. He was so funny, and unique—very strong in what he liked and what he didn’t like. And what he liked were dots on the wall. He liked to find these microscopic dots and do this thing with sound, and touching them very slowly, and then screaming. He would play with things for hours and hours, but he hated primary colors, and all the toys were in primary colors. It was just really interesting, and often comical, and, I don’t know, there were wonderful things about being Graeme’s mother, wonderful things that I definitely wouldn’t have experienced if he had been a more “typical” child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M:&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s bring it all back full circle to Graeme. Graeme, what are three lessons you would like readers to take away from this interview, especially relative to your experiences as a member of your family?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G:&lt;/strong&gt; First, I’ll always say that you have to keep in mind that all people on the spectrum are different from each other. People on the spectrum have different needs. You have to find a way to accommodate their needs, to meet them on their own terms. You have to know who they are individually. So that in itself is more the challenge, but once that’s established, in my family we’ve gone much beyond that, so it’s pretty continuous in the way that information flows from me to Mom and Dad by email or in person. I’ve gotten very good at asking for what I need, and at articulating what I want, and what I don’t want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second thing I’ll talk about, which is actually related, is the constant communication. That’s what keeps us together in my family, even though we don’t spend very much time actually together anymore, except when we travel, like the trip to England last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third would probably be mutual support, like how my parents have found me teachers and other people who have helped me to develop my skills, like my music teacher Randy Raine-Reusch, and when I was young, my music therapist Johanne Brodeur. That does count in the overall picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M:&lt;/strong&gt; Those are great. Thanks, Graeme. Deborah? Bill? Anything to add along related lines?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; I think I have to keep being reminded that I have to respect Graeme’s boundaries about what is really hard for him. Because there are lots of things that I think would be maybe fun to do, and Graeme finds them difficult in ways that I haven’t expected. Or I’ll suggest something that’s spontaneous, and that doesn’t work for Graeme. He likes to plan ahead. So I have to keep being reminded, even though it’s been 43 years, that there are big differences between what I think is easy and what Graeme finds easy. In lots of ways it can be, in my opinion, something small that Graeme sticks on, but for him it’s huge, so that’s something that I’ve had to adjust to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, that’s so important. Bill?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B. I’ll just amplify what Deb said, that respecting who Graeme is has been really, really essential, and like an ongoing project for sure. It’s not something one perfectly masters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, like having this interview happen today, and getting Graeme’s cooperation, was something we really had to work on together. You sitting here for all this time—almost an hour and a half—mainly listening to us talk?

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-water-molecules-upper-atmosphere-chemical-reactions"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Mars’ water is being skimmed off the top. NASA’s MAVEN spacecraft found water lofted into Mars’ upper atmosphere, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aba5229&quot;&gt;its hydrogen and oxygen atoms are ripped apart&lt;/a&gt;, scientists report in the Nov. 13 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This completely changes how we thought hydrogen, in particular, was being lost to space,” says planetary chemist Shane Stone of the University of Arizona in Tucson.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mars’ surface was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/martian-crater-was-once-filled-liquid-water&quot;&gt;shaped by flowing water&lt;/a&gt;, but today the planet is an arid desert (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/8/14&lt;/em&gt;). Previously, scientists thought that Mars’ water was lost in a “slow and steady trickle,” as sunlight split water in the lower atmosphere and hydrogen gradually diffused upward, Stone says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But MAVEN, which has been orbiting Mars since 2014, scooped up water molecules in Mars’ ionosphere, at altitudes of about 150 kilometers. That was surprising — previously the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-dust-storms-water&quot;&gt;highest water had been seen was about 80 kilometers&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/22/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;That high-up water varied in concentration as the seasons changed on Mars, with the peak in the southern summer, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perseverance-mars-weather-dust-storms&quot;&gt;seasonal dust storms&lt;/a&gt; are most frequent (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/14/20&lt;/em&gt;). During a global dust storm in 2018, water levels jumped even higher, suggesting dust storms lift water in a “sudden splash,” Stone says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The top of Mars’ atmosphere is full of charged molecules that are primed for rapid chemical reactions, especially with water. So water up there is split apart quickly, on average lasting only four hours, leaving &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/defenseless-mars-losing-its-atmosphere&quot;&gt;hydrogen atoms to float away&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/27/15&lt;/em&gt;). That process is 10 times faster than previously known ways for Mars to lose water, Stone and his colleagues calculated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This process could account for Mars losing the equivalent of a 44-centimeter-deep global ocean in the past billion years, plus another 17-centimeter-deep ocean during each global dust storm, the team found. That can’t explain all of Mars’ water loss, but it’s a start.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/11/12/error-detected-a-new-feature-helps-authors-submit-their-work/"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">
 &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one wants to find errors in their work, but there’s something even worse: errors that pass through undetected, causing headaches later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv relies on TeXLive 2020 as a compilation system to ensure precise formatting of the submissions from our authors. During the submission process, authors upload their TeX files to the arXiv system, which then compiles them into a PDF. Now, compilation errors will be highlighted during the submission process, helping authors save time and submit their work smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_796&quot; style=&quot;width: 583px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Image of TeX error highlighting&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-796 size-full&quot; height=&quot;243&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/TeX-Error-Highlighting-Key.png&quot; width=&quot;583&quot; /&gt;TeX errors detected by the arXiv submission system are now color-coded&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different types of compilation errors might arise during the submission process. Some errors are so severe that the submission system will not compile the source files into a PDF until they are resolved. For example, if the TeX source references a file that the author forgot to include, processing will fail. Other errors are less obvious at first glance. For example, an error might interfere with formatting, making the content less understandable, or, if references are missing, a question mark will appear instead of numbers corresponding to the bibliography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the compilation process, AutoTeX log files are produced automatically and errors are noted within. In the past, many users found the large block of text challenging to read and interpret quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, errors are highlighted with different colors within the AutoTeX logs during the submission process. Authors can quickly scan a summary of errors, understand their severity, and follow links to relevant arXiv help pages. Additionally, if the source did compile, the number of pages produced is also noted, so authors can confirm that the paper length matches their expectation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_801&quot; style=&quot;width: 1024px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Critical-TeX-Error.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image of critical tex error summary&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-801 size-large&quot; height=&quot;311&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Critical-TeX-Error-1024x311.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This example shows the summary of critical errors, attempted compilation runs, and a link to the relevant arXiv help page.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By scrolling down the AutoTeX log, authors will find specific errors highlighted in various colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_802&quot; style=&quot;width: 818px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/TeX-Error-Example.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TeX Error highlighting example&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-802 size-full&quot; height=&quot;693&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/TeX-Error-Example.png&quot; width=&quot;818&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In this example, an error log shows where the specific errors occurred.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv aims to serve both readers and authors by ensuring that research can be shared quickly and easily. This AutoTeX log highlighting feature was specifically requested by arXiv authors and will likely improve their experience. Readers will also benefit because, with fewer technical errors, articles will be easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;When one of Hye-Sook Park’s experiments goes well, everyone nearby knows. “We can hear Hye-Sook screaming,” she’s heard colleagues say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise that she can’t contain her excitement. She’s getting a closeup look at the physics of exploding stars, or supernovas, a phenomenon so immense that its power is difficult to put into words.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than studying these explosions from a distance through telescopes, Park, a physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, creates something akin to these paroxysmal blasts using the world’s highest-energy lasers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About 10 years ago, Park and colleagues embarked on a quest to understand a fascinating and poorly understood feature of supernovas: Shock waves that form in the wake of the explosions can boost particles, such as protons and electrons, to extreme energies.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Supernova shocks are considered to be some of the most powerful particle accelerators in the universe,” says plasma physicist Frederico Fiuza of SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, Calif., one of Park’s collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of those particles eventually slam into Earth, after a fast-paced marathon across cosmic distances. Scientists have long puzzled over how such waves give energetic particles their massive speed boosts. Now, Park and colleagues have finally created a supernova-style shock wave in the lab and watched it send particles hurtling, revealing possible new hints about how that happens in the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bringing supernova physics down to Earth could help resolve other mysteries of the universe, such as the origins of cosmic magnetic fields. And there’s a more existential reason physicists are fascinated by supernovas. These blasts provide some of the basic building blocks necessary for our existence. “The iron in our blood comes from supernovae,” says plasma physicist Carolyn Kuranz of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who also studies supernovas in the laboratory. “We’re literally created from stars.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Lucky star&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student in the 1980s, Park worked on an experiment 600 meters underground in a working salt mine beneath Lake Erie in Ohio. Called IMB for Irvine-Michigan-Brookhaven, the experiment wasn’t designed to study supernovas. But the researchers had a stroke of luck. A star exploded in a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and IMB captured particles catapulted from that eruption. Those messengers from the cosmic explosion, lightweight subatomic particles called neutrinos, revealed a wealth of new information about supernovas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But supernovas in our cosmic vicinity are rare. So decades later, Park isn’t waiting around for a second lucky event.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;photographs of Hye-Sook Park&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3093292&quot; height=&quot;445&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/110720_supernova_inline-1_hsp.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3093292&quot;&gt;Physicist Hye-Sook Park, shown as a graduate student in the 1980s (left) and in a recent photo (right), uses powerful lasers to study astrophysics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3093292&quot;&gt;from left: John Van der Velde; Lanie L. Rivera/Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, her team and others are using extremely powerful lasers to re-create the physics seen in the aftermath of supernova blasts. The lasers vaporize a small target, which can be made of various materials, such as plastic. The blow produces an explosion of fast-moving plasma, a mixture of charged particles, that mimics the behavior of plasma erupting from supernovas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stellar explosions are triggered when a massive star exhausts its fuel and its core collapses and rebounds. Outer layers of the star &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-nearby-star-goes-supernova-scientists-will-be-ready&quot;&gt;blast outward in an explosion&lt;/a&gt; that can unleash more energy than will be released by the sun over its entire 10-billion-year lifetime. The outflow has an unfathomable 100 quintillion yottajoules of kinetic energy (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/8/17, p. 24&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Supernovas can also occur when a dead star called a white dwarf is reignited, for example after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/companion-star-could-have-triggered-supernova&quot;&gt;slurping up gas from a companion star&lt;/a&gt;, causing a burst of nuclear reactions that spiral out of control (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/30/16, p. 20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image alignwide size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;photograph of a billowy structure on a starry background&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3093297&quot; height=&quot;579&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/110720_supernova_inline-3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1030&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3093297&quot;&gt;Supernova remnants like W49B (shown in X-ray, radio and infrared light) accelerate electrons and protons to high energies in shock waves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3093297&quot;&gt;NASA, CXC, MIT L. Lopez et al (X-ray), Palomar (Infrared), VLA/NRAO/NSF (Radio)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In both cases, things really get cooking when the explosion sends a blast of plasma careening out of the star and into its environs, the interstellar medium — essentially, another ocean of plasma particles. Over time, a turbulent, expanding structure called a supernova remnant forms, begetting a beautiful light show, tens of light-years across, that can persist in the sky for many thousands of years after the initial explosion. It’s that roiling remnant that Park and colleagues are exploring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studying supernova physics in the lab isn’t quite the same thing as the real deal, for obvious reasons. “We cannot really create a supernova in the laboratory, otherwise we would be all exploded,” Park says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In lieu of self-annihilation, Park and others focus on versions of supernovas that are scaled down, both in size and in time. And rather than reproducing the entirety of a supernova all at once, physicists try in each experiment to isolate interesting components of the physics taking place. Out of the immense complexity of a supernova, “we are studying just a tiny bit of that, really,” Park says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For explosions in space, scientists are at the mercy of nature. But in the laboratory, “you can change parameters and see how shocks react,” says astrophysicist Anatoly Spitkovsky of Princeton University, who collaborates with Park.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The laboratory explosions happen in an instant and are tiny, just centimeters across. For example, in Kuranz’s experiments, the equivalent of 15 minutes in the life of a real supernova can take just 10 billionths of a second. And a section of a stellar explosion larger than the diameter of Earth can be shrunk down to 100 micrometers. “The processes that occur in both of those are very similar,” Kuranz says. “It blows my mind.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube alignwide wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Powerful, mysterious stellar explosions are difficult to understand from afar, so researchers have figured out how to re-create supernovas’ extreme physics in the lab and study how outbursts seed the cosmos with elements and energetic particles.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Laser focus&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To replicate the physics of a supernova, laboratory explosions must create an extreme environment. For that, you need a really big laser, which can be found in only a few places in the world, such as NIF, the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore, and the OMEGA Laser Facility at the University of Rochester in New York.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At both places, one laser is split into many beams. The biggest laser in the world, at NIF, has 192 beams. Each of those beams is amplified to increase its energy exponentially. Then, some or all of those beams are trained on a small, carefully designed target. NIF’s laser can deliver more than 500 trillion watts of power for a brief instant, momentarily outstripping the total power usage in the United States by a factor of a thousand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A single experiment at NIF or OMEGA, called a shot, is one blast from the laser. And each shot is a big production. Opportunities to use such advanced facilities are scarce, and researchers want to have all the details ironed out to be confident the experiment will be a success.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a shot is about to happen, there’s a space-launch vibe. Operators monitor the facility from a control room filled with screens. When the time of the laser blast nears, a voice begins counting down: “Ten, nine, eight …”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When they count down for your shot, your heart is pounding,” says plasma physicist Jena Meinecke of the University of Oxford, who has worked on experiments at NIF and other laser facilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the moment of the shot, “you kind of want the Earth to shake,” Kuranz says. But instead, you might just hear a snap — the sound of the discharge from capacitors that store up huge amounts of energy for each shot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then comes a mad dash to review the results and determine if the experiment has been successful. “It’s a lot of adrenaline,” Kuranz says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lasers aren’t the only way to investigate supernova physics in the lab. Some researchers use intense bursts of electricity, called pulsed power. Others use small amounts of explosives to set off blasts. The various techniques can be used to understand different stages in supernovas’ lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;A real shocker&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Park brims with cosmic levels of enthusiasm, ready to erupt in response to a new nugget of data or a new success in her experiments. Re-creating some of the physics of a supernova in the lab really is as remarkable as it sounds, she says. “Other­wise I wouldn’t be working on it.” Along with Spitkovsky and Fiuza, Park is among more than a dozen scientists involved in the Astrophysical Collisionless Shock Experiments with Lasers collaboration, or ACSEL, the quest Park embarked upon a decade ago. Their focus is shock waves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result of a violent input of energy, shock waves are marked by an abrupt increase in temperature, density and pressure. On Earth, shock waves cause the sonic boom of a supersonic jet, the clap of thunder in a storm and the damaging pressure wave that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meteor-explodes-over-russia&quot;&gt;can shatter windows&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of a massive explosion. These shock waves form as air molecules slam into each other, piling up molecules into a high-density, high-pressure and high-temperature wave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In cosmic environments, shock waves occur not in air, but in plasma, a mixture of protons, electrons and ions, electrically charged atoms. There, particles may be diffuse enough that they don’t directly collide as they do in air. In such a plasma, the pileup of particles happens indirectly, the result of electromagnetic forces pushing and pulling the particles. “If a particle changes trajectory, it’s because it feels a magnetic field or an electric field,” says Gianluca Gregori, a physicist at the University of Oxford who is part of ACSEL.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But exactly how those fields form and grow, and how such a shock wave results, has been hard to decipher. Researchers have no way to see the process in real supernovas; the details are too small to observe with telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These shock waves, which are known as collisionless shock waves, fascinate physicists. “Particles in these shocks can reach amazing energies,” Spitkovsky says. In supernova remnants, particles can gain up to 1,000 trillion electron volts, vastly outstripping the several trillion electron volts reached in the biggest human-made particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva. But how particles might surf supernova shock waves to attain their astounding energies has remained mysterious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Downsizing&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Supernova remnants and laser experiments exhibit the same physics, despite being very different in their properties, including their size, shock wave speeds and the temperature and density of their electrically charged particles, or plasma. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-table&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typical supernova remnant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NIF laser experiments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diameter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;300,000,000,000,000 kilometers&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2.5 centimeters&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shock wave velocity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3,000–5,000 kilometers/second&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1,000–2,000 kilometers/second&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plasma temperature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11,000° Celsius&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5,800,000° Celsius&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plasma density&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.2 particles per cubic centimeter&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;50,000,000,000,000,000,000 particles per cubic centimeter&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-right has-small-font-size&quot;&gt;Source: F. Fiuza &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Nature Physics&lt;/em&gt; 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Magnetic field origins&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To understand how supernova shock waves boost particles, you have to understand how shock waves form in supernova remnants. To get there, you have to understand how strong magnetic fields arise. Without them, the shock wave can’t form.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Electric and magnetic fields are closely intertwined. When electrically charged particles move, they form tiny electric currents, which generate small magnetic fields. And magnetic fields themselves send charged particles corkscrewing, curving their trajectories. Moving magnetic fields also create electric fields.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result is a complex feedback process of jostling particles and fields, eventually producing a shock wave. “This is why it’s so fascinating. It’s a self-modulating, self-controlling, self-reproducing structure,” Spitkovsky says. “It’s like it’s almost alive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All this complexity can develop only after a magnetic field forms. But the haphazard motions of individual particles generate only small, transient magnetic fields. To create a significant field, some process within a supernova remnant must reinforce and amplify the magnetic fields. A theoretical process called the Weibel instability, first thought up in 1959, has long been expected to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a supernova, the plasma streaming outward in the explosion meets the plasma of the interstellar medium. According to the theory behind the Weibel instability, the two sets of plasma break into filaments as they stream by one another, like two hands with fingers interlaced. Those filaments act like current-­carrying wires. And where there’s current, there’s a magnetic field. The filaments’ magnetic fields strengthen the currents, further enhancing the magnetic fields. Scientists suspected that the electromagnetic fields could then become strong enough to reroute and slow down particles, causing them to pile up into a shock wave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2015 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Physics&lt;/em&gt;, the ACSEL team reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys3178&quot;&gt;a glimpse of the Weibel instability&lt;/a&gt; in an experiment at OMEGA. The researchers spotted magnetic fields, but didn’t directly detect the filaments of current. Finally, this year, in the May 29 &lt;em&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/em&gt;, the team reported that a new experiment had produced &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.215001&quot;&gt;the first direct measurements&lt;/a&gt; of the currents that form as a result of the Weibel instability, confirming scientists’ ideas about how strong magnetic fields could form in supernova remnants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For that new experiment, also at OMEGA, ACSEL researchers blasted seven lasers each at two targets facing each other. That resulted in two streams of plasma flowing toward each other at up to 1,500 kilometers per second — a speed fast enough to circle the Earth twice in less than a minute. When the two streams met, they separated into filaments of current, just as expected, producing magnetic fields of 30 tesla, about 20 times the strength of the magnetic fields in many MRI machines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What we found was basically this textbook picture that has been out there for 60 years, and now we finally were able to see it experimentally,” Fiuza says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Surfing a shock wave&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the researchers had seen magnetic fields, the next step was to create a shock wave and to observe it accelerating particles. But, Park says, “no matter how much we tried on OMEGA, we couldn’t create the shock.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They needed the National Ignition Facility and its bigger laser.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There, the researchers hit two disk-shaped targets with 84 laser beams each, or nearly half a million joules of energy, about the same as the kinetic energy of a car careening down a highway at 60 miles per hour.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two streams of plasma surged toward each other. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-020-0919-4&quot;&gt;density and temperature of the plasma rose&lt;/a&gt; where the two collided, the researchers reported in the September &lt;em&gt;Nature Physics&lt;/em&gt;. “No doubt about it,” Park says. The group had seen a shock wave, specifically the collisionless type found in supernovas. In fact there were two shock waves, each moving away from the other.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Power pulse&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a recent experiment at NIF, scientists trained lasers on two targets. Two streams of plasma emerged, producing shock waves (center of illustration) where the plasma streams met.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;diagram of an experiment setup&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3093298&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/110720_supernova_inline-4_680.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3093298&quot;&gt;F. Fiuza et al/Nature Physics 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Learning the results sparked a moment of joyous celebration, Park says: high fives to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is some of the first experimental evidence of the formation of these collisionless shocks,” says plasma physicist Francisco Suzuki-Vidal of Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study. “This is something that has been really hard to reproduce in the laboratory.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also discovered that electrons had been accelerated by the shock waves, reaching energies more than 100 times as high as those of particles in the ambient plasma. For the first time, scientists had watched particles surfing shock waves like the ones found in supernova remnants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the group still didn’t understand how that was happening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a supernova remnant and in the experiment, a small number of particles are accelerated when they cross over the shock wave, going back and forth repeatedly to build up energy. But to cross the shock wave, the electrons need some energy to start with. It’s like a big-wave surfer attempting to catch a massive swell, Fiuza says. There’s no way to catch such a big wave by simply paddling. But with the energy provided by a Jet Ski towing surfers into place, they can take advantage of the wave’s energy and ride the swell.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image alignwide size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;computer simulation of particles flying out of a box-shaped structure&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3093300&quot; height=&quot;522&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/110720_supernova_inline-6_1030.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1030&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3093300&quot;&gt;A computer simulation of a shock wave (structure shown in blue) illustrates how electrons gain energy (red tracks are higher energy, yellow and green are lower).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3093300&quot;&gt;F. Fiuza/SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What we are trying to understand is: What is our Jet Ski? What happens in this environment that allows these tiny electrons to become energetic enough that they can then ride this wave and be accelerated in the process?” Fiuza says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers performed computer simulations that suggested the shock wave has a transition region in which magnetic fields become turbulent and messy. That hints that the turbulent field is the Jet Ski: Some of the particles scatter in it, giving them enough energy to cross the shock wave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Wake-up call&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enormous laser facilities such as NIF and OMEGA are typically built to study nuclear fusion — the same source of energy that powers the sun. Using lasers to compress and heat a target can cause nuclei to fuse with one another, releasing energy in the process. The hope is that such research could lead to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ignition-failed&quot;&gt;fusion power plants&lt;/a&gt;, which could provide energy without emitting greenhouse gases or dangerous nuclear waste (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/20/13, p. 26&lt;/em&gt;). But so far, scientists have yet to get more energy out of the fusion than they put in — a necessity for practical power generation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So these laser facilities dedicate many of their experiments to chasing fusion power. But sometimes, researchers like Park get the chance to study questions based not on solving the world’s energy crisis, but on curiosity — wondering what happens when a star explodes, for example. Still, in a roundabout way, understanding supernovas could help make fusion power a reality as well, as that celestial plasma exhibits some of the same behaviors as the plasma in fusion reactors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At NIF, Park has also worked on fusion experiments. She has studied a wide variety of topics since her grad school days, from working on the U.S. “Star Wars” missile defense program, to designing a camera for a satellite sent to the moon, to looking for the sources of high-energy cosmic light flares called gamma-ray bursts. Although she is passionate about each topic, “out of all those projects,” she says, “this particular collisionless shock project happens to be my love.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early in her career, back on that experiment in the salt mine, Park got a first taste of the thrill of discovery. Even before IMB captured neutrinos from a supernova, a different unexpected neutrino popped up in the detector. The particle had passed through the entire Earth to reach the experiment from the bottom. Park found the neutrino while analyzing data at 4 a.m., and woke up all her collaborators to tell them about it. It was the first time anyone working on the experiment had seen a particle coming up from below. “I still clearly remember the time when I was seeing something nobody’s seen,” Park recalls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, she says, she still gets the same feeling. Screams of joy erupt when she sees something new that describes the physics of unimaginably vast explosions. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’re walking through a dark, dingy house. Floorboards creak and you think you hear something moving in the shadows. Suddenly, an engine revs and a blood-splattered man wearing a pig’s head lunges towards you with a chainsaw. You scream and run away. Terrifying, perhaps — but it also sounds kind of fun, right?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We generally think of fear as a negative emotion — something that signals danger and which is unpleasant to experience. Yet so many of us seek out situations that make us scared: haunted fairground rides, scary video games, and horror movies and novels. And now researchers have looked at exactly how the experience of fear is related to our enjoyment of this kind of “recreational horror”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620972116&quot;&gt;Writing in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the team finds that there’s a sweet spot when it comes to creating a scary but enjoyable experience: if you end up feeling too little fear — or too much — then it’s not quite as fun.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40836&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Marc Malmdorf Anderson from Aarhus University and colleagues studied visitors to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://dystopia.dk/haunted-house/&quot;&gt;Dystopia Haunted House&lt;/a&gt;”, a Danish live-action horror attraction, in which people walk through the rooms of a house and are confronted with actors playing spooky characters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before entering the haunted house, participants were fitted with heart rate monitors so that the researchers could look at their physiological response throughout the experience.  Once they had emerged at the other end, participants rated how scared they had been and how enjoyable they had found the haunted house overall. They also rated their fear and enjoyment for three specific locations in the house in which they had encountered a “jump scare” (zombies suddenly jumping out from a staircase, for example, or the aforementioned pig man chasing them with a chainsaw).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, participants reported that the haunted house was both scary and enjoyable. And when the team looked at the link between fear and enjoyment across those three jump scare moments, they found a significant relationship. This took an inverse U shape:  the more scared people reported feeling, the greater their enjoyment — up to a point. When their fear exceeded this point (which was around 6 or so on a scale that went from 0 to 9) then their enjoyment tended to decrease again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This suggests that for a scary experience to be at its most enjoyable, it needs to hit a “sweet spot” so that it is not too tame — but also not exceedingly scary. This makes sense when you think of recreational horror as a form of play, the authors write. We already know that other aspects of play rely on the conditions being “just right”: for example, in order to stimulate people’s curiosity, a challenge shouldn’t be so easy as to make it boring, but also not so hard or confusing that it is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that small-scale fluctuations in participants’ heart rate were related to feelings of enjoyment in a similar way (“small-scale” here refers to fluctuations that occurred across periods of just a few seconds, rather than longer-term changes in heart rate across the entire experience).  People whose heart rate fluctuated more moment-to-moment tended to report more enjoyment — but again, only up to a point. When these fluctuations became too great, then enjoyment began to decrease again. These results suggest that people also hit a sweet spot of physiological arousal when they’re enjoying a scary experience. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are lots more questions to explore — in particular, it would be interesting to know exactly &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; enjoyment decreases when an experience becomes too scary. Do people simply become overwhelmed? Do they stop recognising that they are in a safe, artificial environment? Or could the physical signs of intense fear be souring the experience?  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the authors point out, it would also be interesting to know whether there’s a similar relationship between fear and enjoyment for other media like video games or movies. Still, the “naturalistic” aspect of their research is pretty cool, and is a nice example of work extending beyond the artificial environment of the lab. Not many other studies on fear can boast that they terrified participants with an actual chainsaw-wielding pig man.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620972116&quot;&gt;Playing With Fear: A Field Study in Recreational Horror&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The atmospheric light show nicknamed STEVE may be even weirder than skywatchers thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;STEVE, short for Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement, is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steve-aurora-makes-its-debut-mauve&quot;&gt;sky glow that appears south of the northern lights&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/15/18&lt;/em&gt;). STEVE’s main feature is a mauve band of light formed by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-causes-aurora-glow-known-steve&quot;&gt;stream of plasma&lt;/a&gt; flowing westward through the atmosphere — a different phenomenon from the one that gives rise to auroras (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/30/19&lt;/em&gt;). But STEVE’s purple arc is often accompanied by a “picket fence” of vertical green stripes. That fence looks similar enough to the shimmering green curtains seen in the aurora borealis that scientists thought at least this part of STEVE could be a type of aurora.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recently, studies of the picket fence’s color have cast doubt on its origins. Auroras form when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/auroras-dunes-pulsating-cusp-steve&quot;&gt;electrons from the magnetic bubble, or magnetosphere, surrounding Earth cascade into the atmosphere&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/7/20&lt;/em&gt;). Those electrons make nitrogen in the air glow blue and oxygen glow green. While STEVE’s green picket fence also contains glowing oxygen, a dearth of nitrogen emission hints that the fence is not the same kind of light show as an aurora.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers and citizen scientists have identified an even more unusual aspect of STEVE’s picket fence: small green streaks that stick out like feet from the bottom of some of its vertical stripes. The structure of these horizontal streaks &lt;a href=&quot;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020AV000183&quot;&gt;cannot be formed by the electron showers responsible for auroras&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report in the December &lt;em&gt;AGU Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“It’s really weird, and nobody really knows what’s going on just yet,” says Joshua Semeter, an engineer at Boston University. But the new observations suggest these horizontal streaks — and perhaps the similarly colored fence — arise from some STEVE-specific process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Semeter and colleagues examined horizontal streaks below picket fences in high-resolution images of STEVE taken by citizen scientists. The analysis suggested that the streaks in these images were not actually lines extended across the sky, but only appeared that way due to motion blur, as spherical blobs of glowing gas moved through the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

The discovery of horizontal green streaks below those stripes (one shown in the boxes) suggests that STEVE’s green features are not a kind of aurora.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3093467&quot;&gt;J. Semeter &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;AGU Advances &lt;/em&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These green blobs might arise from turbulence in the torrent of plasma that creates STEVE’s purple band, Semeter says. Positively charged atoms in the plasma may rush through the atmosphere largely unimpeded, forming a smooth purple arc. Meanwhile, electrons in the plasma are far lighter and more liable to get tripped up by Earth’s magnetic field lines — giving those particles a much bumpier ride through the air. As a result, those high-energy electrons may get tangled up in small vortices on the edge of the plasma stream, below the purple streak. There, the particles could excite pockets of oxygen to glow green.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, this is just a theory for what might be occurring. Computer simulations of plasma flowing through the atmosphere could test whether the idea is correct.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whatever is going on with STEVE’s horizontal green features, “there’s some tantalizing evidence” that they’re related to the vertical picket fence, Semeter says. “We found events where these little feet appear before or at the same time as the green column above it.” And some horizontal and vertical streaks looked connected. “It appears that the green emission is actually expanding upward along the magnetic field line,” Semeter says. If so, that could explain why STEVE’s picket fence doesn’t have quite the same color as typical auroras.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While these observations do hint that the fence may arise from STEVE-specific particle interactions, it’s hard to be sure based only on photographs from the ground, says Toshi Nishimura, a space physicist at Boston University who was not involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future satellite observations could confirm whether electrons from the magnetosphere are pouring into the atmosphere in the region of a STEVE picket fence, he says. If satellites don’t see such electron showers, that will bolster the idea that the fence is different from normal auroras.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-hurricanes-landfall-lingering-longer-staying-stronger"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3093461</id>
		<updated>2020-11-11T16:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Atlantic hurricanes are taking longer to weaken after making landfall than they did 50 years ago, thanks to climate change. Over the past 50 years, increasingly warm ocean waters have juiced up the storms, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2867-7&quot;&gt;giving them more staying power&lt;/a&gt; after they roar ashore, scientists report in the Nov. 12 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. That could potentially extend storms’ destructive power farther inland, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As ocean waters warm, tropical cyclones — called hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean — are likely to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/warm-tropical-atlantic-waters-juiced-2017-hurricane-season&quot;&gt;gain in intensity&lt;/a&gt;, studies show (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/28/18&lt;/em&gt;). They can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-climate-change-fueling-hurricane-florence&quot;&gt;hold more moisture&lt;/a&gt;, leading to seemingly unremitting rainfall (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/13/18&lt;/em&gt;). And they may &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tropical-cyclones-have-slowed-over-last-70-years&quot;&gt;move more slowly&lt;/a&gt;, allowing more time to dump that rain on coastal communities. All of this increases the potential hazard on land (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/6/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once a storm hits land, its energy begins to dissipate. But that relief is coming later than it once did, report physicists Lin Li and Pinaki Chakraborty, both of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Li and Chakraborty analyzed the intensity of historical Atlantic hurricanes over the first 24 hours after landfall. In 1967, a typical storm’s intensity decayed by 76 percent within the first day after landfall. But by 2018, storms were only 52 percent less intense after 24 hours. That trend, the researchers say, aligns with increasing sea-surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico and the western Caribbean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s because the intense winds of cyclones feed on moisture and heat picked up from the warm waters, and warmer air can also hold more moisture. So as the oceans heat up, they not only add more moisture, making hurricanes rainier, but also add more heat — like a portable engine the storm uses to fuel its fury for just a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Audrey Hepburn’s face and Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris. Darcy Bussell dancing the role of Princess Aurora in Sleeping Beauty and &lt;em&gt;The Starry Night&lt;/em&gt; by Vincent van Gogh. All of these things, and more, are widely regarded as looking beautiful. Do we have, then, a “beauty centre” in the brain that responds to something that we find visually beautiful, no matter what it is? For almost two decades, psychologists and neuroscientists have been exploring this question, without reaching a consensus. Now a new meta-analysis of existing fMRI studies on almost 1,000 people concludes that no, our brains don’t have one “beauty centre” — but two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40829&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hu Chuan-Peng at Tsinghua University, China, led &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-020-00827-z&quot;&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Cognitive, Affective &amp;amp; Behavioural Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;. The team identified 49 studies that involved whole brain analyses of young and middle-aged people (aged 18 – 50), none of whom were art experts. Some of these studies focused on responses to human faces, while others looked at reactions to art, including paintings, sculpture, visual textures, dance videos and architectural space. In all cases, fMRI was used to image the brains of the participants, who also made aesthetic judgements, or at least rated how much they liked or disliked a given stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using a technique called “activation likelihood estimation” (ALE) meta-analysis, the team searched for any crossover between the studies in patterns of brain activity while participants viewed stimuli that they judged to be beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This analysis revealed that beautiful faces triggered greater activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and adjacent pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and also the left ventral striatum, compared with faces rated as being not beautiful. However, this wasn’t the case for art. Beautiful visual art was associated with more activity not in these regions but in the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What might explain those different response patterns? The ventral striatum is already known to be a key part of the brain’s reward pathway, so the team thinks that the structure responds to the rewarding value of a beautiful face. This signal, along with other information, is then integrated into the vmPFC, to generate the positive feeling associated with perceiving facial beauty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beautiful faces, then, seem to be more like “primary rewards”, similar to food and sexual contact — rewards that benefit our (or our genes’) survival and which are inherently pleasurable. Viewing beautiful art is, though, more like getting money: a “secondary reward”, or something that we have learned to find pleasurable. As such, it’s handled differently in the brain — it’s perceived as being beautiful due to high-level, top-down processing in the aMPFC. (Earlier work has found an involvement for the aMPFC in secondary rewards, the team notes.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s perhaps worth noting that what this new study can’t do — and was not designed to do — is contribute to the ongoing debate about the extent to which beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The team’s meta-analysis revealed similarities in how people across the studies process “beautiful” vs “not beautiful” faces and visual art, but what was beautiful, or not, was judged by each individual. Neither, of course, can the study shed light on how we process non-visual beauty — such as “beautiful” music, for example. Further research will be necessary to reveal how this fits in; perhaps we have yet more “beauty centres”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, debate about the nature of beauty goes back millennia. Plato wrote of a “common and abstract beauty” that is independent of the various forms of beautiful things, an idea that is still entertained today. This new study suggests that this is not the way our brains see things: we don’t perceive an “essence” of beauty in all manner of objects, but rather respond to at least two distinct types.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-020-00827-z&quot;&gt;Seeking the “Beauty Center” in the Brain: A Meta-Analysis of fMRI Studies of Beautiful Human Faces and Visual Art&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-infection-gut-immune-system"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Some immune defenses of the brain may have their roots in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study in mice finds that immune cells are first trained in the gut to recognize and launch attacks on pathogens, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2886-4&quot;&gt;migrate to the brain’s surface to protect it&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report online November 4 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. These cells were also found in surgically removed parts of human brains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every minute, around 750 milliliters of blood flow through the brain, giving bacteria, viruses or other blood-borne pathogens an opportunity to infect the organ. For the most part, the invaders are kept out by three membrane layers, called the meninges, which wrap around the brain and spinal cord and act as a physical barrier. If a pathogen does manage to breach that barrier, the researchers say, the immune cells trained in the gut are ready to attack by producing a battalion of antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most common route for a pathogen to end up in the bloodstream is from the gut. “So, it makes perfect sense for these [immune cells] to be educated, trained and selected to recognize things that are present in the gut,” says Menna Clatworthy, an immunologist at the University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Clatworthy’s team found antibody-producing plasma cells in the leathery meninges, which lie between the brain and skull, in both mice and humans. These immune cells produced a class of antibodies called immunoglobulin A, or IgA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These cells and antibodies are mainly found in the inner lining of the gut and lungs, so the scientists wondered if the cells on the brain had any link to the gut. It turned out that there was: Germ-free mice, which had no microbes in their guts, didn’t have any plasma cells in their meninges either. However, when bacteria from the poop of other mice and humans were transplanted into the mice’s intestines, their gut microbiomes were restored, and the plasma cells then appeared in the meninges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This was a powerful demonstration of how important the gut could be at determining what is found in the meninges,” Clatworthy says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers captured microscope images of an attack in the meninges of mice that was led by plasma cells that had likely been trained in the guts. When the team implanted a pathogenic fungus, commonly found in the intestine, into the mice’s bloodstream, the fungus attempted to enter the brain through the walls of blood vessels in the meninges. However, plasma cells in the membranes formed a mesh made of IgA antibodies around the pathogen, blocking its entry. The plasma cells are found along the blood vessels, Clatworthy says, where they can quickly launch an attack on pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To my knowledge, this is the first time anyone has shown the presence of plasma cells in the meninges. The study has rewritten the paradigm of what we know about these plasma cells and how they play a critical role in keeping our brain healthy,” says Matthew Hepworth, an immunologist at the University of Manchester in England who was not involved with the study. More research is needed to classify how many of the plasma cells in the meninges come from the gut, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The finding adds to growing evidence that gut microbes can play a role in brain diseases. A previous study, for instance, suggested that in mice, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boosting-gut-bacterium-helps-mice-fight-als-disease&quot;&gt;boosting a specific gut bacterium could help fight amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, or ALS, a fatal neurological disease that results in paralysis (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/22/19&lt;/em&gt;). And while the new study found the plasma cells in the brains of healthy mice, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)31560-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867418315605%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&quot;&gt;previous research has found other gut-trained cells&lt;/a&gt; in the brains of mice with multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease of the brain and the spinal cord. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, the researchers want to understand what cues plasma cells follow in the guts to know it is time for them to embark on a journey to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-control-increasing-cases"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;November is beginning to feel a lot like last March.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Europe, where the coronavirus was largely under control for much of the summer and fall, cases are skyrocketing nearly everywhere. Twenty countries, including the United Kingdom and France, have shuttered restaurants, introduced curfews or generally urged people to stay at home, though most schools and universities are staying open for now. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cases are surging across the United States, too, where more than 100,000 new infections are being reported each day. Already in November, more than half of states have set records for the most cases in a week, and in places such as Minnesota, Utah and Wisconsin, some hospitals are nearing capacity. In North Dakota, nearly 1 in every 14 people has already contracted the coronavirus, with 2,254 cases reported November 8 alone in a state of 762,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, “the virus is going into its sweet spot at a time that we’re exhausted by it,” says Jeffrey Shaman, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in New York City. That sweet spot is indoors, where people are spending more time as the weather in the Northern Hemisphere turns colder — and where the virus can spread more easily. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Despite such a grave outlook, experts say it’s still not too late to turn the tide. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shutting down borders, businesses and schools are among the most drastic measures to do that. Worries over economic consequences may hold governments back from issuing widespread stay-at-home orders this time around, though.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who unveiled a &lt;a href=&quot;https://buildbackbetter.com/press-releases/biden-harris-transition-announces-covid-19-advisory-board/&quot;&gt;COVID-19 advisory board&lt;/a&gt; November 9, has proposed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://buildbackbetter.com/priorities/covid-19/&quot;&gt;multipronged plan&lt;/a&gt; for controlling the pandemic, including nationwide mask mandates and expanded testing. But Biden won’t take office until January 20, and President Donald Trump has repeatedly downplayed the surge in cases.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-pfizer-effective-early-trial-data&quot;&gt;a COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt; — or vaccines — is closer than ever (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/9/20&lt;/em&gt;), most experts agree that vaccines probably won’t be available to everybody until late spring or early summer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means getting through the winter will require falling back on the familiar public health tools of physical distancing, mask wearing, and testing and isolating infected people, Shaman says. But all of those measures fall short unless everyone is willing to follow the rules.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Living in this reality can be draining, acknowledges Aleksandra Zając, a doctor specializing in nuclear medicine in Warsaw. Doctors and patients alike are tired of not being able to leave their homes and having to wear a mask when they do, she says, but “as a doctor, I really see the need for all those restrictions.” People aren’t helpless against the virus, she says. “We still have some impact on what’s going on.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zając devised &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omnicalculator.com/health/swiss-cheese-coronavirus&quot;&gt;a calculator &lt;/a&gt;to help people learn how much wearing masks and goggles, regularly washing their hands and keeping distance from others might help protect them. Alone, none of those measures is perfect, but doing them all together can boost protection, like layering slices of Swiss cheese so that holes in one slice are covered by another slice. The Swiss cheese idea is not new, but it’s still relevant for stacking public health measures, Zając says. It goes for individual actions, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“One individual cannot do much” beyond protecting themselves, Zając says, “but if we sum up all the individuals together and they all follow the rules, I truly believe we can control this pandemic.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists know much more about the virus than they did in March, and that knowledge can help make the most of all the public health tools at our disposal. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Mask up&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dozens of studies have made it abundantly clear that wearing a mask is one of the most effective steps an individual can take to help curb the pandemic. Masks are especially crucial in&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-why-wearing-masks-controversial&quot;&gt; lessening the risk&lt;/a&gt; of someone who doesn’t know they’re infected passing the virus to someone else (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/26/20&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there’s a growing understanding among scientists that masks are good for the wearer too. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated their scientific guidance on November 10 to acknowledge that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cloth masks can reduce the number of infectious droplets inhaled by the wearer&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a degree of protection, especially when masks are multi-layered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a study published October 23 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, scientists estimate that if 95 percent of people wore masks when outside their homes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1132-9&quot;&gt;nearly 130,000 deaths from COVID-19 might be averted&lt;/a&gt; in the United States between the end of September and the end of February 2021. If 85 percent of people wear masks, about 96,000 lives might be saved, the researchers calculate. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-neck-gaiters-masks-droplets-study&quot;&gt;debate over &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; kind of mask&lt;/a&gt; is best, however, has been spirited (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/12/20&lt;/em&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to ubiquitous cloth masks, only one randomized clinical trial in the world is testing their effectiveness in preventing COVID-19. That &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04471766&quot;&gt;trial in Guinea-Bissau&lt;/a&gt; is giving all 66,000 expected participants advice about how to avoid respiratory illnesses. Half of those people will each also get two locally sewn cloth masks. The trial is expected to wrap up in November.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some research on the prevention of other respiratory illnesses suggests that a cloth mask’s effectiveness depends on many factors, including wearing the mask properly over both the nose and mouth. Regular washing in hot water is also necessary, says Raina MacIntyre, a mask researcher at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;woman wearing a surgical mask, with &amp;quot;wear a mask!&amp;quot; poster in background&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3093452&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/111020_TI-JL_covid-update_inline-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3093452&quot;&gt;In areas where coronavirus cases are spiking, some local governments have implemented mask mandates in public to cut down transmission. Masks both limit the amount of virus an infected person emits and offer some protection to the wearer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3093452&quot;&gt;Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2015, she and colleagues published in &lt;em&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/em&gt; results of a trial conducted in Hanoi, Vietnam. Roughly 1,600 health care workers at 15 hospitals were assigned to either wear a medical mask at all times during their shift, to wear a two-layer cloth mask or to follow the hospital’s standard practice, which may or may not involve wearing a mask. The results weren’t encouraging. At the end of the five-week study, people in the cloth mask group had the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577&quot;&gt;highest rate of respiratory infections&lt;/a&gt;, such as colds — even higher than the group that wasn’t regularly wearing masks. The researchers concluded that health care workers shouldn’t wear cloth masks and opt instead for medical masks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trial was very controversial, MacIntyre says, “because the message was that cloth masks could be dangerous. That caused a lot of angst during the pandemic. In March and April, I had a lot of health workers in the U.S. and Europe contacting me and saying, ‘The hospital has run out of respirators. Is it better I wear no mask than wear a cloth mask?’” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That prompted MacIntyre and colleagues to examine unpublished data from the trial. Both surgical and cloth masks get contaminated with respiratory viruses, the researchers found. But surgical masks are disposable. If people didn’t wash their reusable cloth masks every day, the masks became more and more contaminated. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you washed your cloth mask in a washing machine with hot water, you were &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/10/9/e042045&quot;&gt;just as protected as wearing a surgical mask&lt;/a&gt;,” MacIntyre says. But workers who hand-washed their masks had double the risk of infection of those wearing a medical mask, the researchers reported September 28 in &lt;em&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The bottom line is, the washing is part of the protective effect of a cloth mask,” MacIntyre says. She recommends a daily wash in water at 60° to 90° Celsius, far hotter than anyone could stand to hand-wash. Shrinkage from hot water also tightens up pores in the mask, keeping the virus from slipping through easily. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health care workers should also wear protective goggles to prevent rare cases of infection through the eye, MacIntyre says. But determining whether people going about their daily lives need goggles, face shields or other eye protection in addition to masks is a tricky bit of calculus, she says. “You have to look at community transmission rates. You have to look at where you’re actually going. Are you just going for a walk outside or are you going to a doctor’s surgery and are going to be sitting in an unventilated waiting room for two hours?” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The best most people can do is to take all the precautions they can, including avoiding large gatherings — especially indoors — wearing masks and keeping distance from people they don’t live with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Fine-tuning lockdowns&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early in the pandemic, lockdowns and social distancing measures (of varying severity) enacted in many countries largely worked. Staying at home starved the virus of transmission opportunities, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-lockdowns-may-have-averted-infections&quot;&gt;preventing over 500 million infections&lt;/a&gt; in six hard-hit countries, according to some experts (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/9/20&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Circumstances are different now. “I don’t think we’ll lock down at that scale again,” says Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis and a member of Biden’s task force. Now that scientists have a better understanding of transmission, blanket lockdowns may not be needed. Instead, restrictions could focus on crowded, poorly ventilated spaces like restaurants and bars. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If cases continue to grow exponentially, however, stricter lockdowns may be the only tool left to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. But such measures are increasingly less palatable to many Americans, Osterholm says. “What the public will accept is key. If they won’t comply, it doesn’t really matter what you recommend or how you recommend it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Limits of lockdowns&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stay-at-home orders also don’t stop transmission within a household, where experts are learning that the virus can rapidly spread. In a sample of 101 homes with a positive coronavirus test,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6944e1.htm&quot;&gt; 53 percent of other people living in those homes became quickly infected&lt;/a&gt;, researchers reported in the Nov. 6 &lt;em&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We know that it’s really gatherings in close contact indoors that are riskiest,” says Alison Hill, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. “There’s no reason why if you’re in your own house or among family or friends to think that the disease can’t spread.” Isolating infected members of a household, wearing masks and improving ventilation can limit household transmission, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And not everyone can stay home, which has contributed to inequities in who is getting sick in this pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the United States, residents of poorer neighborhoods, often home to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-why-african-americans-vulnerable-covid-19-health-race&quot;&gt;racial and ethnic minorities disproportionately affected by COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN:4/10/20&lt;/em&gt;), were less likely to stay at home during the early months of the pandemic than residents of richer neighborhoods. Cell phone mobility data suggest that this difference stems from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-00998-2&quot;&gt;work-related demands&lt;/a&gt;, according to a study published November 3 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;. Residents of the highest-income neighborhoods reduced days at work outside the home by 13.7 percent, compared with 6.6 percent for residents of lower-income neighborhoods, Jonathan Jay, a public health researcher at Boston University, and colleagues found. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many residents of lower-income neighborhoods work jobs that can’t be done from home. But when there was a choice, people in these neighborhoods did limit their activities, Jay says. The data showed that people of all income groups reduced outings unrelated to work at roughly similar levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Policies like restricting evictions so people don’t fear losing their home if they miss work, expanding unemployment insurance and mandating paid sick leave could help these residents physically distance, Jay says.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Test and trace                      &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lockdowns by themselves will not end the pandemic. They are only supposed to be temporary measures that buy time for local and state health departments to beef up other infection-control strategies. Crucial among these are testing and contact tracing, a tried-and-true public health intervention whereby &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-u-s-contact-tracing-end-social-distancing&quot;&gt;contacts of positive cases are quickly identified and instructed to quarantine&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/29/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Contact tracing is really key when you have a disease that’s as fast-spreading as COVID-19,” because it breaks crucial chains of transmission, says Martial Ndeffo, an infectious diseases researcher at Texas A&amp;amp;M University in College Station. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contact tracing and isolation is most powerful when cases are identified early in the course of infection, their contacts are traced and informed of their exposure quickly, and those contacts comply with requests to quarantine. Such a system requires broadly available testing and lots of contact tracers to do the detective work. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;person in car getting a nasal swab for a COVID test&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3093453&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/111020_TI-JL_covid-update_inline-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3093453&quot;&gt;Drive-thru coronavirus testing sites, similar to this one, have popped up across the United States. Easily accessible testing is crucial to quickly identifying cases, tracing contacts and isolating potentially infected people to break the chains of transmission.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3093453&quot;&gt;Xavierarnau/E+/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, even with relatively small caseloads, contact tracing systems can’t keep up with a growing epidemic. At this point, most of the United States can’t keep up. In October, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/10/14/923468159/covid-19-contact-tracing-workforce-barely-inching-up-as-cases-surge&quot;&gt;only three states and the District of Columbia&lt;/a&gt; had enough full-time contact tracers to deal with current caseloads, according to a survey conducted by NPR and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. And as cases climb, even well-staffed systems could be overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Given the number of cases in the U.S., it is unrealistic to think that most states have the resources and available staff to raise the army of contact tracers needed,” Ndeffo says. Biden’s COVID-19 response plan includes efforts to “mobilize at least 100,000 Americans across the country” to boost the contact tracing effort. Currently, there are just over 50,000 contact tracers nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Robust contact tracing systems work only if people comply with public health officials and share their contact history or quarantine if necessary. Yet &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/10/30/the-challenges-of-contact-tracing-as-u-s-battles-covid-19/&quot;&gt;only 58 percent of Americans&lt;/a&gt; would be likely to speak with a public health official who contacted them by phone or text message about the coronavirus outbreak, according to a Pew Research survey released October 30. “A substantial number of people do not comply with or provide adequate information needed for contact tracing to be effective,” Ndeffo says. Clearer and more consistent public health messaging could improve these numbers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Time is of the essence&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s important to act quickly to introduce social distancing measures when case counts begin to surge, as they are now in the United States and Europe, Shaman says, because outbreaks grow at exponential rates. “Exponential growth leads to a tsunami-like effect; it gets worse the longer you wait on it.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He and colleagues simulated what would have happened had states done exactly what they did at the beginning of the U.S. epidemic in March, only earlier. Enacting social distancing and stay-at-home orders on March 1 instead of March 8 would have headed off about 600,000 confirmed cases and 32,000 deaths. Acting two weeks earlier would have avoided more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/11/05/sciadv.abd6370&quot;&gt;1 million cases and about 60,000 deaths nationwide&lt;/a&gt;, Shaman and colleagues reported November 6 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.        &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No one can turn back the clock. But countries including Vietnam, Taiwan, Singapore, New Zealand and Australia have shown that acting aggressively can curb the spread of the virus. “Going forward, the longer you delay in acting on this virus the more damage it does,” both to people who are infected and to the economy, Shaman says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, at the end of September, 89 counties in Tennessee eased or removed social distancing restrictions. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/sites/default/files/public_files/Vanderbilt%20COVID19%20Report-Oct%2027.pdf&quot;&gt;as COVID-19 cases rose, traffic to bars and restaurants decreased&lt;/a&gt;, researchers from Vanderbilt University in Nashville report. Cell phone mobility data as of October 21 suggest that business dropped once restrictions were lifted and was 24 percent below where it was during the same time in 2019. Those findings suggest that infection rates, not restrictions, have a bigger effect on people’s choices, the researchers conclude.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you don’t control the virus,” Shaman says, “you’re not going to have an economy.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the 16th century, an eminent French&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_surgeon&quot;&gt; barber surgeon&lt;/a&gt; named Ambroise Pare noted—with amazement—that some of his patients who had undergone limb amputation complained months later that they still felt sensations (including pain) coming from their missing limb. Pare’s observation is thought to be the first recorded description of &lt;em&gt;phantom limb&lt;/em&gt;, a condition in which sensations continue to occur in a part of the body that has been lost (due to accident or injury) or surgically removed. Despite the name, phantom limb doesn’t only occur in limbs, and has also been recorded after the loss or removal of other parts of the body—like breasts, genitals, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15101965/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;and even teeth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Although Pare wrote about phantom limb in the 1500s, the term &lt;em&gt;phantom limb&lt;/em&gt; wouldn’t first be used until the Civil War—more than three centuries later. At that time, the renowned physician Silas Weir Mitchell was an army surgeon stationed at the South Street Hospital in Philadelphia. So many amputees were treated at South Street Hospital (especially after the Battle of Gettysburg) that &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5325361/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;soldiers called it “Stump Hospital.”&lt;/a&gt; Mitchell noted that most of the amputees he treated there continued to experience sensations from their missing limbs. He described these lingering sensations as “sensory ghosts” or “phantoms,” which led to the use of the term &lt;em&gt;phantom limb&lt;/em&gt; to describe the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, phantom sensations are recognized as a common experience in those who have lost a limb. It’s thought that &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17053811/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;almost all amputees have phantom sensations&lt;/a&gt;, and the majority of them also suffer from some degree of phantom pain. In one study of 5000 American veterans, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6709380/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;78% of them reported experiencing phantom pain in their amputated limbs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The presentation of phantom sensations can vary from patient to patient. In most cases, the sensations begin almost immediately after the surgery or injury that led to the loss of the limb (after consciousness has returned and any anesthetic has worn off). &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9762952/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;But in about a quarter of patients&lt;/a&gt;, the sensations may not appear for several days or weeks. Sometimes the phantom sensations fade away after a few days or weeks, but in other cases they persist for years—or even decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In many patients, the phantom limb takes on a habitual posture (e.g., arm slightly bent). But that posture may change spontaneously, and some patients complain that their phantom limb ends up in awkward positions that generate discomfort and pain. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9762952/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;One anecdotal report describes a patient&lt;/a&gt; who lost a limb after a grenade exploded in it. He complained that his phantom hand was perpetually held in a painful, tightly-clenched fist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-rte-preserve-empty=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes phantom limb?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Phantom limb is still not very well understood. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain it, but it’s likely that the underlying mechanism differs slightly from case to case. In this article, I’ll discuss a few of the most common explanations for phantom limb. In an individual patient, it’s very possible more than one of the following mechanisms is at play—or that other explanations altogether are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Changes to the central nervous system&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;
      

    
  


  


&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The prevailing explanation for phantom limb sensations is an idea known as &lt;em&gt;cortical reorganization&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;cortical remapping&lt;/em&gt;. To explain this hypothesis, let’s consider the case of an individual who loses their arm in an accident. Before the accident, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; that carried sensations from the arm communicated with neurons in a region known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/primary-somatosensory-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;somatosensory cortex&lt;/a&gt;, which receives information about touch, pain, temperature, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/proprioception&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;proprioception&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., the position of the body in space) from all over the body. Specifically, neurons carrying information from the arm interact with neurons in a part of the somatosensory cortex devoted to processing information about arm sensations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;After the accident, however, those somatosensory neurons are deprived of their normal source of neuronal input. Consequently, they begin to respond to signaling from other nearby neurons. This can cause sensations felt in other parts of the body (e.g., the face) to lead to the stimulation of neurons in the somatosensory cortex that are devoted to the (now missing) arm. The activation of these “arm” somatosensory neurons causes the brain to perceive sensations in the arm, even though it is no longer there. The extent to which this type of maladaptive cortical reorganization &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7777055/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;occurs is correlated with the severity of phantom limb pain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It should be noted that reorganization in non-cortical areas, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thalamus&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/subcortical&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;subcortical&lt;/a&gt; structure involved in processing nearly all incoming sensory information) &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9450753/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;also seems to play a role&lt;/a&gt; in some phantom sensations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Body representation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Another popular explanation for phantom limb centers around the idea that the brain typically relies on an internal representation of the body for generating an awareness of where our body is in space—and thus for maintaining posture, making movements, etc. This internal representation of the body is likely created by networks of neurons that integrate information of various types in the brain (e.g., tactile, visual—even emotional). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to some researchers, the internal representation of the body can be the root of phantom limb sensations and pain. This might occur when, after a limb is lost, the body representation remains intact. In other words, the representation of the body generated in the patient’s brain still includes the intact limb, creating an expectation or sense that the limb is still present. This might lead to abnormal sensations, discomfort, or pain when incoming sensory information conflicts with the neural body representation (e.g., the eyes see that no leg is present, but the brain still expects a leg to be there). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Peripheral nervous system&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the early days of phantom limb research, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/peripheral-nervous-system&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;peripheral nervous system&lt;/a&gt; was thought to be the sole cause of phantom limb pain. Today, explanations typically involve the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/central-nervous-system&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;central nervous system&lt;/a&gt; as well, but the peripheral nervous system is still believed to be an important factor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;After the loss of a limb, the damaged &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/axon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;axons&lt;/a&gt; that once supplied the limb don’t simply stay idle. Instead, they often attempt to repair themselves by growing new extensions (a process called &lt;em&gt;sprouting&lt;/em&gt;). After loss of a limb, however, these new extensions essentially have nowhere to go. They form a mass of neural tissue at the site of amputation called a &lt;em&gt;neuroma&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The axons that make up the neuroma do not remain dormant. Instead, they can generate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/action-potential&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;action potentials&lt;/a&gt; in an erratic manner. This aberrant signaling is thought to be a potential mechanism underlying some of the spontaneous pain phantom limb patients can experience. The abnormal neural activity might be exacerbated by pathological signaling coming from the area where the axons from the missing limb enter the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/spinal-cord&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spinal cord&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-rte-preserve-empty=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treatments for phantom limb pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are a number of pharmacological treatments for phantom limb pain. They include many of the same pain-relieving drugs used to treat other types of neuropathic pain, such as anticonvulsant and opioid drugs. The effectiveness of pharmacological treatment, however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30349693/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tends to be variable&lt;/a&gt;—which likely reflects the numerous causes underlying phantom limb pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;One unique approach to treating phantom limb pain is called &lt;em&gt;mirror therapy&lt;/em&gt;. In this technique, a mirror is situated between the missing and intact limb so it reflects the patient’s intact limb. This creates the illusion (from the patient’s perspective) that they have two intact limbs. They can move their intact limb and observe the illusory limb moving in the same manner. It is thought that this imagery may help to reduce some of the discomfort caused by the lack of visual feedback from a missing limb that the brain has maintained an internal representation of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Although &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18032777/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;studies support the effectiveness of mirror therapy&lt;/a&gt;, the mechanisms underlying why the approach works are not fully understood. Some &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24327313/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research, however, suggests mirror therapy may &lt;/a&gt;help to reverse the post-amputation cortical reorganization mentioned above. The effectiveness of mirror therapy has increased interest in similar approaches, like using virtual reality to create a representation of a limb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-rte-preserve-empty=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;References (in addition to linked text above):&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Collins KL, Russell HG, Schumacher PJ, Robinson-Freeman KE, O'Conor EC, Gibney KD, Yambem O, Dykes RW, Waters RS, Tsao JW.

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2020-storm-theta-record-atlantic-hurricane-climate"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;It’s official: 2020 now has the most named storms ever recorded in the Atlantic in a single year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On November 9, a tropical disturbance brewing in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean gained enough strength to become a subtropical storm. With that, Theta became the year’s 29th named storm, topping the 28 that formed in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With maximum sustained winds near 110 kilometers per hour as of November 10, Theta is expected to churn over the open ocean for several days. It’s too early to predict Theta’s ultimate strength and trajectory, but forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration say they expect the storm to weaken later in the week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If so, like most of the storms this year, Theta likely won’t become a major hurricane. That track record might be the most surprising thing about this season — there’s been a record-breaking number of storms, but overall they’ve been relatively weak. Only five — Laura, Teddy, Delta, Epsilon and Eta — have become major hurricanes with winds topping 178 kilometers per hour, although only Laura and Eta made landfall near the peak of their strength as Category 4 storms.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Even so, the 2020 hurricane season started fast, with the first nine storms &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/predictions-2020-atlantic-hurricane-storm-season-worse&quot;&gt;arriving earlier than ever before&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/7/20&lt;/em&gt;). And the season has turned out to be the most active since naming began in 1953, thanks to warmer-than-usual water in the Atlantic and the arrival of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-may-make-el-nino-la-nina-less-predictable&quot;&gt;La Niña, a regularly-occurring period of cooling in the Pacific&lt;/a&gt;, which affects winds in the Atlantic and helps hurricanes form (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/21/19&lt;/em&gt;). If a swirling storm reaches wind speeds of 63 kilometers per hour, it gets a name from a list of 21 predetermined names. When that list runs out, the storm gets a Greek letter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the wind patterns and warm Atlantic water temperatures set the stage for the string of storms, it’s unclear if climate change is playing a role in the number of storms. As the climate warms, though, you would expect to see more of the destructive, high-category storms, says Kerry Emanuel, an atmospheric scientist at MIT. “And this year is not a poster child for that.” So far, no storm in 2020 has been stronger than a Category 4. The 2005 season &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/beyond-abcs-north-atlantic-posts-record-hurricane-season&quot;&gt;had multiple Category 5 storms&lt;/a&gt;, including Hurricane Katrina (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/20/05&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot amount of energy in the ocean and atmosphere this year, including the unusually warm water, says Emanuel. “The fuel supply could make a much stronger storm than we’ve seen,” says Emanuel, “so the question is: What prevents a lot of storms from living up to their potential?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Storms Sally, Paulette, Rene, Teddy and Vicky in the Atlantic&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3093429&quot; height=&quot;376&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/110620_CS_storms_inline_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3093429&quot;&gt;On September 14, five named storms (from left to right, Sally, Paulette, Rene, Teddy and Vicky) swirled in the Atlantic simultaneously. The last time the Atlantic held five at once was 1971.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3093429&quot;&gt;NOAA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A major factor is wind shear, a change in the speed or direction of wind at different altitudes. Wind shear “doesn’t seem to have stopped a lot of storms from forming this year,” Emanuel says, “but it inhibits them from getting too intense.” Hurricanes can also create their own wind shear, so when multiple hurricanes form in close proximity, they can weaken each other, Emanuel says. And at times this year, several storms did occupy the Atlantic simultaneously — on September 14, five storms swirled at once.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear if seeing hurricane season run into the Greek alphabet is a “new normal,” says Emanuel. The historical record, especially before the 1950s is spotty, he says, so it’s hard to put this year’s record-setting season into context. It’s possible that there were just as many storms before naming began in the ‘50s, but that only the big, destructive ones were recorded or noticed. Now, of course, forecasters have the technology to detect all of them, “so I wouldn’t get too bent out of shape about this season,” Emanuel says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some experts are hesitant to even use the term “new normal.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People talk about the ‘new normal,’ and I don’t think that is a good phrase,” says James Done, an atmospheric scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. “It implies some new stable state. We’re certainly not in a stable state — things are always changing.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/11/10/being-more-authentic-on-social-media-could-improve-your-wellbeing/"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s become somewhat of a truism that you shouldn’t believe everything you see on social media. Where someone’s life looks perfect, we’re often reminded, there are probably a handful of problems silently situated away from the camera. Nobody’s life is as shiny, flawless, or enviable as it might appear in their carefully curated feed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But presenting ourselves more authentically on social media — ditching those things we want to believe are true about ourselves in favour of those that are — could be good for our wellbeing, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18539-w&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; by Erica R. Bailey from Columbia University and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40820&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, the team looked at the data of 10,560 Facebook users who had completed both personality and life satisfaction assessments through the myPersonality app (the data was originally collected between 2007 and 2012 and made available for approved researchers to study, though the app has since been &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/22/facebook-bans-first-app-since-cambridge-analytica-mypersonality-and-suspends-hundreds-more&quot;&gt;banned by Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for improper data protection). These assessments were then compared to predictions of personality from Facebook likes and from status updates, to give a measure of how “authentically” the users presented themselves on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was a positive correlation between life satisfaction and authenticity — but no indication, however, of the direction of causality. In other words, it wasn’t clear whether authenticity led to greater wellbeing or vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To further examine the direction of cause-and-effect, the team asked 90 participants to spend two weeks posting on social media in a particular manner. For one week, they were asked to post in an authentic way, and for the other in a self-idealised way — i.e. posting in the way they would &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to be seen rather than the way they really are. At the end of each week, participants recorded their subjective wellbeing, life satisfaction, mood, and positive and negative affect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the week of authentically posting, participants reported significantly higher levels of wellbeing, mood, and positive affect. There was also a marginally significant impact on negative affect, though overall life satisfaction was not affected. This suggests that authentic posting might actually lead to higher levels of wellbeing than self-idealised posting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; people behave the way they do on social media should be considered in further research. People may have different motivations for self-idealising online, which could affect how they feel while doing so. If you’re not self-aware and feel you’re simply sharing things that really do authentically reflect who you are, does that have the same impact on wellbeing as actively deviating from your real self-view? It’s also unclear whether posting authentically is actually any better than not posting at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But for those of us who do post online, it might be a good reminder to resist the pressure to present a perfect life online. Seeing online friends or influencers as normal people, rather than unattainably idealistic, can be deeply reassuring — there’s a reason there’s been a rise, for example, in “skin-positive influencers”, who share pictures of acne and scars. And this study suggests that such authenticity doesn’t just benefit others — there’s a chance it might make you feel better, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18539-w&quot;&gt;Authentic self-expression on social media is associated with greater subjective well-being&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/BMC-BioMedical-Engineering-HERO-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-12145 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;471&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/BMC-Biomedical-engineering-cover-211x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;331&quot; /&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; is an open access, peer-reviewed journal that considers articles on all aspects of biomedical engineering, including fundamental, translational and clinical research. It combines tools and methods from biology and medicine with mathematics, physical sciences and engineering towards the understanding of human biology and disease and the improvement of human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke with one of &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;‘s Editorial Board Members (EBMs), Professor Seeram Ramakrishna from the National University of Singapore, about his perspective on the journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: When and how did you become an EBM for &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; was launched in 2018, and published its first article in January 2019. I was invited to submit a review article to &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; by the Editor, Dr. Lingling Tian. I was impressed with the professionalism and quality of the peer review process, and hence got interested in &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;. Upon invitation and foresight discussions with Lingling, I gladly accepted to join the editorial board of &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; in July 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; provides an international peer-reviewed platform for these important areas, I am convinced that it will facilitate advances in the biomedical engineering community with the ultimate goal of improving human healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Compared with other journals in the field, especially well-known ones, what makes &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering &lt;/em&gt;different?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; considers quality articles on all aspects of biomedical engineering.  Specific topics include biomaterials, nanomedicine, regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, medical technologies, robotics and rehabilitation engineering, Biomechanics, biosensors and bioelectronics, and Biomedical Imaging. As &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; provides an international peer-reviewed platform for these important areas, I am convinced that it will facilitate advances in the biomedical engineering community with the ultimate goal of improving human healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, BMC is a pioneer of open access publishing. This year makes the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary of BMC! As part of the BMC Series journals, &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; is a fully open access journal. Published articles are free to read and share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How’s the paper quality of the journal and what’s your opinion on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/about?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;review policy&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; has a professional in-house editorial team, with support from a strong and international &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;editorial board&lt;/a&gt;. It offers a rigorous, efficient and fair peer review service. Since its launch, &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; has been receiving good quality submissions from around the world. &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;‘s editorial policy requires that the reported studies must be scientifically valid; for research articles, this includes a scientifically-sound research question, the use of suitable methods and analysis, and following community-agreed standards relevant to the research field.  &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; achieved a good measure of success with 42 &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/articles?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;articles published&lt;/a&gt; and consistently improves its standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Could you please share what suggestions you have for the journal’s future development?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; We aim to grow &lt;em&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt; into a renowned biomedical engineering journal with global impact in the next few years. This is a very promising biomedical engineering journal, on which I aspire to publish my own work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, I would encourage the Editors to provide more support to the authors in the research community, in particular to the junior ones who are at their early stage of research. They might be not very experienced with writing and publishing their research in scientific journal. The editors could support them by giving presentations or seminars on topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What suggestions do you have for young researchers and author who would like to submit their paper to open access journal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Open access is a good way to share and disseminate knowledge, which gives readers free and instant access, enabling faster discovery of the latest research. Young researchers are encouraged to submit their work to open access journal if their funding allows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 Journals have flagged more than three dozen articles by a team of authors in Iran for concern over the integrity of their data. The moves have come in the 15 months since data sleuths raised questions about the data in more than 170 papers from the group.  Among the most recent moves, a nutrition journal … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2020/11/10/journals-flag-concerns-in-three-dozen-papers-by-nutrition-researchers/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Journals flag concerns in three dozen papers by nutrition researchers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

 &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;/em&gt;Music and Autism: Speaking for Ourselves &lt;em&gt;author Michael B. Bakan sat down for a Zoom conversation with his Chapter 7 co-author, the Vancouver-based multi-instrumentalist and music instrument collector Graeme Gibson, and with Graeme’s parents, autism researcher Dr. Deborah Gibson and bestselling science fiction author William (Bill) Gibson. Their four-way conversation covered a range of topics, from how raising a child on the spectrum shaped Bill’s writing of iconic novels like &lt;/em&gt;Neuromancer, &lt;em&gt;to how Deborah’s advocacy on Graeme’s behalf helped to spearhead the movement toward inclusive public education in Vancouver, to how Graeme’s abiding fascination with musical instruments—combined with his prodigious research and memory—enabled him to identify virtually every instrument in the expansive world instrument collection of London’s Horniman Museum. Here is part one of the interview; &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-two/&quot;&gt;read part two here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael (M):&lt;/strong&gt; Hello, Graeme, Deborah, and Bill! Thank you so much for doing this interview. I’ve really been looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graeme, a question for you for starters: You have a collection of, what, more than 400 musical instruments? And these instruments are from all over the world, and you can actually &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; most of them, some very well, which is really impressive. How did your interest in musical instruments start?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill (B):&lt;/strong&gt; Wasn’t there a little electric keyboard you used to play when you were really little?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graeme (G):&lt;/strong&gt; Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. There was, and that’s also what propelled me to be able to learn where the notes are laid out on the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deborah (D):&lt;/strong&gt; Actually, it wasn’t electric—Michael, I think I sent you a picture of Graeme playing it when he was a toddler—it was this tuneless&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;little wooden toy piano that we got him for his second Christmas (he was one year old), and he was so mesmerized by it. From the time he was a baby, Graeme was just so interested in sound, and he showed a real affinity for instruments of all kinds. He liked Santa’s jingle bells more than any other present. He was just drawn to music and sound, and when we had records he would &lt;em&gt;insist&lt;/em&gt; on Bill playing them over and over again. At that point he was signing rather than speaking, and he would make a very insistent gesture, spinning his finger around in circles like a record spinning on a turntable, to say to Bill, ‘Play it again, play it again!’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;239&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Eg1Tuffkyk4-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Graeme with toy piano. Photo by Dr Deborah Gibson, used with permission.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G:&lt;/strong&gt; Then later, when I was a teenager, I did have an electronic keyboard—a Casio SK1, and I would play that for many hours every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; And then, all of a sudden, you asked for a balalaika!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, yeah. In terms of instruments from other world cultures, my first major acquisition was a Russian balalaika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; What I remember is that Graeme walked up to me one day and said, “I want a balalaika.” &lt;em&gt;[Graeme laughs]&lt;/em&gt; And I only barely knew what a balalaika was: it’s triangular, it’s a Russian, like… something. How on earth do you think you ever decided to get a balalaika?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G:&lt;/strong&gt; I might have heard it somewhere, maybe the radio or something. I sort of had an idea of what it was and the way that it was played. It’s just the way my ears pick it up. I wish I could explain that, but unfortunately, I can’t translate that software here, so… And later, especially after I started studying with my music teacher Randy Raine-Reusch, who owns thousands of instruments from around the world, he introduced me to many other instruments as well—especially stringed instruments, which are my specialty—and my collection grew and grew. Now I have an &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~museumofworldmusic.com/&quot;&gt;online instrument museum&lt;/a&gt; where people can visit my collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M:&lt;/strong&gt; Right, and I seem to recall that you enjoy visiting “live” musical instrument museums as well, right, Graeme?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes! Like last year, when Mom and Dad and I went to London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; There was a wonderful museum of ethnic musical instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah! The Horniman Museum in, uh… I forget where exactly it is, but, uh…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; It wasn’t close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G:&lt;/strong&gt; No, it was far, but well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; And Graeme knew the name of every single instrument without even looking at the label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; He was the most incredible museum guide, and he would describe the slight discrepancies between that version of the instrument and then the one that came from twenty miles further south. It was a real eye opener for me on how much Graeme knows about music, about instruments, about all things music-related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, his knowledge—of instruments, the Indian &lt;em&gt;raga &lt;/em&gt;system, you name it—is immense. When I assign our chapter in the &lt;em&gt;Music and Autism&lt;/em&gt; book to my students, I’ll say to them, ‘Check out how much this guy knows. You’re Ph.D. ethnomusicology students; you should know as much as he does!’ &lt;em&gt;[laughter]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; And we have to thank Randy [Raine-Reusch] for that. He’s just been an extraordinary teacher for Graeme.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;And as far back as when he was a baby, it wasn’t just music and instruments that interested Graeme. It was sounds of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; kinds. When the fridge went on and off…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G:&lt;/strong&gt; Usually around 9 p.m. or so. &lt;em&gt;[Deborah and Bill laugh]&lt;/em&gt; Yeah, yeah. There would always be that time, sometime in the evening, when it was very routine. You’d hear the click, and then you’d hear the fridge cycles. &lt;em&gt;[Deborah laughs]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; I gotta say, I never, ever paid attention to our fridge before in that way. &lt;em&gt;[laughter] &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Eg1borx4S-A.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Graeme with some of his instruments. Photo by Michael O’Shea, used with permission.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M:&lt;/strong&gt; A question for you now, Bill. At the same time that you were being a stay-at-home dad to Graeme, in the late 1970s/early 1980s, you were also working on your first novel, &lt;em&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/em&gt;, which would of course bring you considerable fame—not to mention revolutionize the literature of science fiction, inspire the iconic &lt;em&gt;Matrix &lt;/em&gt;film series, and (along with some of your earlier short stories) even change the English language with your coining of the term “&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oed.com/view/Entry/240849&quot;&gt;cyberspace&lt;/a&gt;” and such. I have to think that being a first-time dad—and a dad to Graeme in particular—would have influenced your writing during that time. True?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; I think that being Graeme’s dad made me think more actively about consciousness and perception than I would have otherwise, that is, had I not had that experience, because I had the example of Graeme totally perceiving everything, but perceiving it often in a slightly other way. And I think, particularly for someone that writes the sort of fiction I write, that’s a hugely useful example to have every day, as opposed to, you know, watching everyone else doing what everyone else is doing with the information they’re receiving, although that’s essential too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, on a practical level, as it became more evident that Graeme wasn’t “just any baby,” it sort of upped the ante on what I was doing. And I also was in a situation where if I was going to be doing anything other than co-parenting Graeme, the perfect thing to do would be trying to become a writer, because you do it from home, literally any time of day, you know, whenever Graeme was asleep, for instance, which is when I did a lot of my writing. So, in some ways it was sort of a natural fit. Yeah, I can’t think of anything else I could have done. And I was lucky, because I was able to make a living at being a freelance writer of fiction, even though, looking back on it, there’s almost no one else I ever knew who tried to do that who was able to do it; they all wound up having day jobs. And I have yet to have one, I’m happy to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there’s one other thing I’ve wondered about, too, that seems relevant to your question. Something that’s been consistent through my work are characters who are AIs, they’re Artificial Intelligences, but are unnervingly human in their presentation, and seemingly in their consciousness. As far as I know they’re much more totally human than we have any right to expect Artificial Intelligences in the future to be, at least so far. So, something that happens, I know from watching reader feedback, is that readers become invested in the AI’s humanity, but then are occasionally henceforth startled by moments of cognitive dissonance where they realize that it’s human but it’s not quite standardly human. And that’s the result of me, if it were music &lt;em&gt;playing&lt;/em&gt; it a certain way, to get that effect of deliberately going slightly off key to remind the reader that the character’s not “standard issue” human. And, you know, that may be something subsequent to being Graeme’s dad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-two/&quot;&gt;Read part two of the interview here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feature image by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/cW3nDFVpi10&quot;&gt;Karim Manjra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-one/&quot;&gt;A conversation on music and autism (part one)&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/638548362/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/638548362/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/638548362/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/638548362/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/638548362/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/638548362/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f10%2fEg1Tuffkyk4-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/638548362/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/638548362/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/638548362/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/638548362/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/reimagining-our-music-classes-for-zoom/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Reimagining our music classes for Zoom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/10/they-may-not-be-pros-but-theyre-recording-artists-now/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;They may not be pros—but they’re recording artists now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/five-famous-doctors-in-literature/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Five famous doctors in literature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Starting today, authors now have a new license option for their submitted works, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/&quot;&gt;CC BY-NC-ND&lt;/a&gt;. This is the &lt;strong&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs&lt;/strong&gt; license, which stipulates that others can share the work only with proper attribution and no commercial or derivative works can be made from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_781&quot; style=&quot;width: 150px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image of creative commons logo&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-781 size-thumbnail&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/11/createive-commons-logo-150x150.png&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;Creative Commons helps overcome legal obstacles to knowledge sharing&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an author submits work to arXiv, they choose from a selection of licenses that prescribe how others can –or cannot– use their article. This is critical because, as a repository for scholarly material, arXiv keeps a permanent record of every article and version posted. arXiv needs permission from the copyright holder to host and distribute the work. Permission is granted through a license, chosen by the person who submits the work, and the submitter must certify that they have the right to grant that license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors often ask arXiv for advice on choosing the appropriate license. In general, arXiv values openness and encourages choosing a liberal license for reuse of articles. However, each situation is unique, and arXiv cannot make any specific recommendations. Authors need to consider that journals have different policies regarding preprints, embargo periods, and post-publication distribution. Funding and government agencies might require specific licenses. The license chosen during arXiv submission is irrevocable and cannot be changed, but different versions of the same work can have different licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_778&quot; style=&quot;width: 1341px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot of license options&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-778 size-full&quot; height=&quot;227&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/11/List-of-available-licenses-with-arrow.png&quot; width=&quot;1341&quot; /&gt;Available licenses are listed in the submission system. The purple arrow points to the new option, CC BY-NC-ND.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/&quot;&gt;CC BY-NC-ND&lt;/a&gt; license was added to arXiv’s selections because many authors submit works that have already been accepted to journals, which each have their own unique policies regarding copyright and article reuse. With this option, authors can comply with the policies of some journals, while also extending permissions to arXiv and others to openly share their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it is the submitter’s responsibility to choose the appropriate license for their content, obtain permission from their coauthors, and certify that they have the right to grant that specific license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to seeing the new option, authors may notice that the order of the licenses listed in the submission system has changed. The licenses, with the exception of CC Zero, are now ordered from most liberal re-use at the top (CC-BY) to most limited re-use (arXiv.org perpetual non-exclusive). For the top five options, the original copyright holder retains ownership after posting on arXiv. The exception, CC Zero, is rarely used and allows creators to waive their right to enforce copyright and put their works into the worldwide public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details, please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/help/license&quot;&gt;arXiv License information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited 11/9/20 at 12:50pm to clarify CC Zero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/11/09/narcissistic-people-are-more-likely-to-take-part-in-political-activities/"/>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s likely to be a diverse set of factors driving any given person’s interest in politics. It could be that their parents had a political affiliation they’ve subsequently inherited; they may have had a personal experience that changed how they see the world; politics could provide a social life or community connections; they might consider political action a civic duty; or they might just be passionate about a particular issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220919212&quot;&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, there may be another motivation, too — namely narcissism. The paper finds that particular kinds of narcissism are related to taking part in political activities, suggesting that deeply rooted individual factors may play a large part in our willingness to engage in politics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40811&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zoltán Fazekas from Copenhagen Business School and Peter K. Hatemi from The Pennsylvania State University explored the link between narcissism and political participation through three surveys: one in Denmark, with 2,450 participants, and two in the US, with 500 and 2,280 participants respectively. In each study, participation in politics was measured through an eight-item questionnaire, which gave an overall measure of participation based on how often people took part in various activities like signing a petition, boycotting or buying products for political reasons, participating in protests, attending political meetings, contacting politicians, donating money, contacting the media, and taking part in political forums and discussion groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Narcissism was measured using the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, with participants asked to choose between two opposing statements (e.g., “I insist upon getting the respect that is due me” vs. “I usually get the respect that I deserve”). From these questions an overall score is generated, as well as scores for different facets of narcissisms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As anticipated, there were significant and positive correlations between narcissism and political participation across all three studies, with more narcissistic people participating in politics more than the less narcissistic. The size of this effect was similar to that of other important predictors of political participation like level of education.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was no relationship between narcissism and voting in general elections, however, though this might be related to high turnout — in the 2011 general election in Denmark, turnout was an impressively high 88%. Voting in US &lt;em&gt;midterm&lt;/em&gt; elections, which tend to have lower turnout, was linked to narcissism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There were also some interesting links between participation and particular facets of narcissism. Higher levels of authority-seeking, perceived leadership ability, and feelings of superiority were consistently associated with taking part in political activities. This makes sense: if you believe yourself to have the qualities of a leader then taking part in political activity could be one way of exercising that sense of moral superiority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, aspects of narcissism like entitlement, exploitativeness, and self-sufficiency were &lt;em&gt;negatively &lt;/em&gt;related to participation: people displaying these traits were less likely to engage with politics. This paints a fairly gloomy picture of political participation, with politics guided by “those who both want more but give less”, as the team puts it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the direction of causality in the relationship between narcissism and political participation is unclear. It would be interesting to look at it from another angle: what impact does political participation have on narcissism? In other words, does frequent engagement with politics change people’s personalities? If you’re surrounded by people who share your political convictions, it’s not too much of a leap to believe that you might end up feeling morally superior to others. Those with latent narcissistic traits may also find them coming to the fore when engaging with politics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Either way, it’s interesting to consider some of the more individual motivations for political participation. For many, political affiliations or stances are deeply personal: they can say something quite profound about who somebody is. The team also suggests that there may be a specific link between narcissism and participation in &lt;em&gt;populist&lt;/em&gt; political activities: looking more deeply into individual factors may help us understand why such policies are so popular and why others, perhaps more collectivist or altruistic in nature, fail to gain support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220919212&quot;&gt;Narcissism in Political Participation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Minghua Zheng will talk about the paper &quot;Bacterial colony counting with Convolutional Neural Networks in Digital Microbiology Imaging&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counting bacterial colonies on microbiological culture plates is a
time-consuming, error-prone, nevertheless essential quantitative task in Clinica
Microbiology Laboratories. With this work we explore the possibility to find
effective solutions to the above issue by designing and testing two different
machine learning approaches. The first one is based on the extraction of a
complete set of handcrafted morphometric and radiometric features used within a
Support Vector Machines solution. The second one is based on the design and
configuration of a Convolutional Neural Networks deep learning architecture. To
validate, in a real and challenging clinical scenario, the proposed bacterial
load estimation techniques, we built and publicly released a fully labeled large
and representative database of both single and aggregated bacterial colonies
extracted from routine clinical laboratory culture plates. Dataset enhancement
approaches have also been experimentally tested for performance optimization.
The adopted deep learning approach outperformed the handcrafted feature based
one, and also a conventional reference technique, by a large margin, becoming a
preferable solution for the addressed Digital Microbiology Imaging quantification
task, especially in the emerging context of Full Laboratory Automation systems.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Children’s Tumor Foundation issued the following press release on November 5, 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Children’s Tumor Foundation (CTF), the foremost funder of neurofibromatosis (NF) research, and &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, a leading peer-reviewed scientific journal, are pleased to release the first output of the Drug Discovery Initiative Registered Reports (DDIRR) Award, which CTF and &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctf.org/news/ctf-plos-one-funder-publisher-partnership&quot;&gt;first announced in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. The Registered Reports model, first piloted by CTF and PLOS ONE, ensures that all valid research – both successes and failures in the lab and clinics – are made public.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The publication, titled &lt;em&gt;Evaluating modified diets and dietary supplement therapies for reducing muscle lipid accumulation and improving muscle function in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), &lt;/em&gt;by Dr. Aaron Schindeler, PhD, associate professor at the University of Sydney, reports &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237097&quot;&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; on L-Carnitine as an effective dietary supplement for reducing muscle lipid accumulation and potentially addresses muscle weakness and fatigue often observed in NF1 patients. The result of the study led to the opening of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.who.int/trialsearch/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=ACTRN12618002021257&quot;&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; for NF1 patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Funder-Publisher Partnership around the DDIRR program allows researchers to preregister their study, obtain an in-principle acceptance (IPA) to publication in the journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, and obtain funding from the Children’s Tumor Foundation to conduct their proposed experiments. Both CTF and &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; maintain a separate and independent review process to align proposed research with both the funder mission as well as to safeguard soundness, accuracy, and scientific rigor. Through this model, before any experiments start, researchers have the opportunity to address reviewer remarks and submit revisions of their protocol until it is ready for publication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The innovation of this new funding model creates multiple benefits for all participants. Researchers are able to make adjustments to their protocols before they start any lab experiment, funders are ensured that the quality of the proposed research is high quality, and the publisher secures a manuscript that has robust reproducibility in line with the mission and ethos of the journal. In addition, the published manuscript links to the original registered protocol deposited on the Open Science Framework &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/rr/&quot;&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; for full transparency and traceability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are very proud to see the first manuscript of this new award program out, the transparency and the quantity of the protocol adds to the soundness of the research, independent from the nature of the outcome,” said Salvatore La Rosa, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer, Children’s Tumor Foundation. “Positive or negative results are equally valuable when a robust protocol is applied, and this model allows for either to emerge.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted that our partnership with the Children’s Tumor Foundation has resulted in the first publication of a preregistered study,” adds Joerg Heber, PLOS Editorial Director and Editor-in-Chief of PLOS ONE. “This scheme ensures the robustness of the research conducted and is a win for openness and transparency in research.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are today seeing growing dissatisfaction with the pay-to-publish model for open access. As this requires authors (or their funders or institutions) to pay an article-processing charge every time they publish a paper it is felt to be discriminatory, especially for non-funded researchers and those based in the Global South  (see, for instance, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/03/06/plan-s-and-the-global-south-what-do-countries-in-the-global-south-stand-to-gain-from-signing-up-to-europes-open-access-strategy/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchprofessionalnews.com/rr-news-africa-pan-african-2020-10-is-africa-prepared-for-the-business-of-open-access/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/s7cx4&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;float: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g_Ry8G6q1gk/X6JBOVYhjuI/AAAAAAAAsAQ/Ht88mBjFrk0AEzqs99imhboqUk5mGr3NQCNcBGAsYHQ/s320/Sarah%2B32.JPEG&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;320&quot; data-original-width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g_Ry8G6q1gk/X6JBOVYhjuI/AAAAAAAAsAQ/Ht88mBjFrk0AEzqs99imhboqUk5mGr3NQCNcBGAsYHQ/w150-h200/Sarah%2B32.JPEG&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 107%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;PLOS' Sara Rouhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a result, various alternative approaches are emerging intended to move away from APCs, including crowdfunding and membership schemes. Here institutions are asked to commit to paying an annual fee to a publisher, with the aim of pooling sufficient funds to cover the costs of making all the papers in a journal open access.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the more successful implementations of this model is the Open Library of Humanities (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openlibhums.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;OLH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;), which has operated what it calls its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openlibhums.org/site/about/the-olh-model/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Library Partnership Subsidies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; scheme since 2015.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clearly, if the costs of the annual fee are to be viewed as reasonable by those asked to take part a sufficient number of institutions need to sign up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The inherent weakness of the model is that a small group of community-minded institutions could end up paying all a publisher’s costs and everyone else would be able to “free ride”. In effect, those who join a membership scheme could end up shouldering the costs for everyone to have free access.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A key question is how many universities are willing to join an OA membership scheme. OLH co-founder Martin Eve has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://eve.gd/2020/10/22/backlist-to-the-future-a-new-business-model-for-university-presses-and-open-access-books/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;estimated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that there are only around 300 libraries who will do so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nevertheless, we should not doubt that there is a real wish to move beyond APCs and many have come to believe that membership schemes are the best way of doing this. To be successful, however, they will need to broaden the pool of those willing to take part.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Annual Flat Fee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;With this aim in mind, in October the Public Library of Science (PLOS) launched what it calls its Community Action Publishing (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;CAP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) initiative for its two selective journals &lt;i&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/i&gt;. The hope is that the journals can be gradually moved away from having to charge APCs and that the publishing costs can be shared as widely as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Specifically, PLOS is inviting universities to pay an annual flat fee that will give their faculty unlimited publishing opportunities in the journals (there are separate “communities” for each journal) without the need to pay an APC each time. However, authors of institutions who do not join the scheme will be charged a non-member fee (NMF) that will increase in price over time, as below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jBuQYsYdVI8/X6JCQEJvisI/AAAAAAAAsAk/HphLhyB7rQ06TMomwtKPnAa1ry6qNLxNACNcBGAsYHQ/s437/NMF.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;162&quot; data-original-width=&quot;437&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jBuQYsYdVI8/X6JCQEJvisI/AAAAAAAAsAk/HphLhyB7rQ06TMomwtKPnAa1ry6qNLxNACNcBGAsYHQ/s16000/NMF.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The rising cost of the NMF is intended to encourage universities who have not joined to do so in order to avoid their faculty having to pay to publish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;PLOS hopes that the annual fees will be low enough to attract a sufficient number of institutions but that the pooled funds will eventually be adequate to meet all the costs of publishing the journals. In the interim, the NMF means that there will be two separate revenue streams coming in and the free riding issue will be avoided.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The hope is that the NMF can be discontinued when the pilot period ends (it lasts from 2021 until 2023). However, says PLOS Director of Strategic Partnerships Sara Rouhi, that will be dependent on all the large institutions that PLOS is targeting joining the scheme. “If we don’t have a stable membership by then, we might have to offset lack of participation with more NMFs”, she told me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tiers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The annual fee institutions will be asked to pay will be calculated by looking at their faculty’s publishing activity between 2014 and Q3 2019. Based on that they will then be assigned to a fee tier, as below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CJXHcnHxe8o/X6JDAxwqvKI/AAAAAAAAsAw/-oOizaA3C1grfshy9z2Ga3xFzScF2up3QCNcBGAsYHQ/s412/Tiers.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;289&quot; data-original-width=&quot;412&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CJXHcnHxe8o/X6JDAxwqvKI/AAAAAAAAsAw/-oOizaA3C1grfshy9z2Ga3xFzScF2up3QCNcBGAsYHQ/s16000/Tiers.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To help broaden the pool, the annual fee will be calculated on the publishing activity not just of the institution’s corresponding authors, but of their contributing authors too. The aim is to ensure that “the cost of publishing is distributed more equitably among representative institutions.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In other words, PLOS will calculate how often during the historical publishing activity period an institution was associated with both corresponding and contributing authors and then assign a weighting to each type of author. Specifically, contributing-author articles will be weighted at half that of corresponding authors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the PLOS FAQ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/faqs/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;explains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;: “Publishing activity is counted by determining the number of times an institution was associated with a corresponding author &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the number of times an institution was associated with contributing authors. Papers where the institution is affiliated with the corresponding authors are weighted as 1 article and papers where the institution is affiliated with the contributing author are weighted as ½ article. (Multiple contributing authors from the same institutions are counted only once).”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Universities whose faculty have never published in the journals can also opt to pay the tier’s lowest fee in order to “insure” themselves against the possibility that one or more of their faculty might publish in the journal within the time period of the scheme (Jan 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt; 2021 –&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dec 31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;2023).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, says PLOS, Research4Life countries are automatically members of each community so researchers in those countries will never be subject to fees. And authors unable to pay non-member fees can apply for waivers as per the standard fee-waiver mechanisms offered by PLOS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To signal its own commitment to the community PLOS has set targets for each journal and will cap its margin at 10%. Revenue exceeding the community targets will go back to members at renewal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Time will tell how successful the scheme will be in broadening the pool beyond the 300 libraries who normally join OA membership schemes. Certainly, the challenge will be that much greater given that it is being launched at a time when many libraries are signing expensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/#:~:text=Transformative%20agreements%20are%20those%20contracts%20negotiated%20between%20institutions,fair%20price%20for%20their%20open%20access%20publishing%20services.&quot;&gt;transformative agreements&lt;/a&gt; with legacy publishers and universities are facing the financial impact of the pandemic. Some have also &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailchi.mp/ce-strategy/the-brief-issue-28&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that, as selective journals, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; do not publish a sufficient number of papers to make it worthwhile for many institutions to participate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;My initial thought was that PLOS will be targeting three separate types of institution (corresponding-author institutions, contributing-author institutions, and “insurance” institutions). Sara Rouhi suggests that this is not the way to view it. Below is an exchange I had with her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Levers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: I understand the PLOS Community Action initiative will target 3 types of institution:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.&lt;span&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Corresponding-author institutions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 22.5pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-top: 0cm; margin: 0cm 0cm 0cm 22.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.&lt;span&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Contributing-author institutions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;           &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.&lt;span&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Insurance institutions (those institutions whose researchers don’t currently publish with the PLOS journals but who might want to insure against the possibility that one of their researchers will do in the future).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;I guess there will be some overlap between 1 and 2 but I assume you will have done some calculations on the numbers of potential institutions for each category. If so, can you share them with me?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SR: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;While we initially grouped institutions this way, libraries and consortia consistently fed back to us that this was more complicated/confusing than it needed to be. So rather than think of different types of “institutions,” it’s easier to think of different publishing activity “types” – publishing as a lead author, publishing as a contributing author, or publishing with affiliations in both designations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given the selectivity and niche of these journals, some research-intensive universities publish little to not-at-all, and smaller institutions publish more frequently as lead authors. Simplifying the participation criterion to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;publishing activity elides the traditional distinction of “research intensive” vs. “teaching” institutions etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t want to add further confusion by grouping institutions as you’ve indicated. We purposely eliminated this distinction for clarity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Ok. I ask this question in the context of Martin Eve’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/7961882/6701287299563734785&quot;&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; that there are only 300 libraries that will support OA membership schemes. (I should add that he said this in the context of a new initiative from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.copim.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;COPIM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; that aims [like PLOS] to “broaden the pool” of universities willing to join a membership scheme).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SR: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;As you say, Martin Eve identified about 300 libraries that will support OA membership schemes. There’s some nuance worth flagging, however. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The TL;DR is that Martin’s statement is true if you assume institutions that are participating for largely altruistic reasons – because it’s the “right thing to do.” The PLOS CAP model couldn’t be predicated on that as a buying motivation. So it helps to go back to “collective action” basics. Credit to Dr. Kamran Naim for elucidating this at the Basel Sustainable Publishing Forum last week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For collective action schemes to work there are generally two levers you can pull: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.&lt;span&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Encourage “pro-collective” behaviour by leveraging group affinity and social incentives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 37.5pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-top: 0cm; margin: 0cm 0cm 0cm 37.5pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpLast&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.&lt;span&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Appeal to economic self-interest (aka “private benefit”)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;From my perspective, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scoap3.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SCOAP 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and OLH lean heavily on the first lever. Participating in them is the “right” thing to do so libraries support them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The challenge with only pulling on this lever is sustainability over time. SCOAP3 relies heavily on CERN’s ongoing support and has the challenge of large beneficiaries like Russia, Brazil and India not participating while benefitting from the open content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;OLH memberships are very small financial commitments that maintain OLH but make growth of the program difficult. Martin talked about this on a webinar we did for UKSG earlier in the year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A collective model that focuses primarily on the second lever is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/7961882/6701287299563734785&quot;&gt;Subscribe2Open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; The primary benefit is getting the community to agree to make content open in exchange for a discount. If all members do not opt-in, the content stays behind a paywall. The combination of a private benefit (the discount) with the public good (making the content open) is a strong motivator for participation and a big part of why the model is so successful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;PLOS Community Action Publishing attempts to pull both levers. The pro-collective/group affinity/social incentives relates to the moral imperative – especially in a time of pandemic – to make biomedical research open to read and open to publish. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://library.duke.edu/about/directory/staff/jeff.kosokoff&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jeff Kosokoff’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; comment that “Open Access &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; social justice,” speaks to this. Indeed, we have many commitments based on this mission-aligned priority for libraries. However what has interested partners from mere interest to actual commitment is the equitable fee structure (and relative affordability given the current budget crisis).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;That said, without including appeals to economic self-interest, the PLOS CAP model would suffer from the same sustainability issues as other collectives. Hence our implementation of a secondary, “back up” revenue stream – non-member fees (NMFs) for authors from non-CAP members.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;These NFMs are not meant to penalize authors but rather to encourage libraries to join rather than expose their authors to fees. For many institutions, the NMFs per article will be higher than the annual fee the library would pay to join one or both collectives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Benefits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The NMFs help offset slow uptake of institutions who are not able to find the funds to support a model like this immediately. Thanks to those fees coming in, libraries can take more time to join and we can offer flexibility for institutions that need to leave the collective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are several benefits to this:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Enlarging the pool of institutions that would participate in this collective gives us the flexibility to create a much finer tuned fee structure with a long tail of low dollar fee tiers to accommodate institutions that do not publish frequently in either journal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those low fee tiers allow institutions strapped for funds and/or infrequent publishing institutions to participate because they support the moral imperative of equity and inclusivity that the model promotes. It simply doesn’t cost them that much to “do the right thing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Research intensive institutions then derive benefit from the “research light” institutions participating since they offset some of the cost burden. More institutions of varying publishing intensity means lower fees for everyone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, Martin is right if you’re counting only relatively wealthy institutions that want to do the “right thing.” If you start adding other considerations, especially private benefits (aka, we don’t want our authors to see non-member fees) and recognition of contributing author affiliations, you get a much larger pool and set of incentives to motivate ongoing participation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Targets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;As for our target institutions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;there are&lt;b&gt; 909 total institutions&lt;/b&gt; with some publishing history (some combination of lead and co-author affiliations) in the time period we evaluated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;44 of those are in Tiers 1-4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;80 are in Tiers 5-7&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;The remainder are in Tiers 8-12&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;there are &lt;b&gt;1,557 total institutions&lt;/b&gt; with some publishing history (some combination of lead and co-author affiliations) in the time period we evaluated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;45 are in Tiers 1-5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;152 are in Tiers 6-8&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;The remainder are in Tiers 9-12 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I say, I wouldn’t necessarily correlate rough groupings of similar institutions as “corresponding author institutions, contributing author institutions, and insurance institutions” especially since it does not include the thousands of organisations with no publishing history who might want to participate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, it’s probably fair to say that the highest tiers have institutions that published a lot in both designations. The middle tiers were a combination but at lower volume, and the lowest tiers were low volume and mostly in the contributing author designation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Threat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/7961882/6701287299563734785&quot;&gt;webinar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1155cc;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;you gave in September you said that if transformative agreements flourish there probably won’t be sufficient money left in library budgets to support schemes like PLOS Community Action. How big a threat do you think there is here?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SR:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; This, of course, comes down to how you define “transformative agreements.” If you mean the standard RAP/PAR deals that integrate historic subscriptions with open access publishing that stays revenue neutral, then yes. If these are negotiated with large commercial publishers first, we’re looking at new kind of “big deal” that locks in library monies with subscription publishers of hybrid open-access journals. Non-profits, small societies, and native-OA publishers may very well not make it out the other side of this transition (especially if “read” institutions’ subscription monies exit the system).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s hard to know how big the threat is as it ultimately comes down to choices libraries make. Many appear to be balancing both imperatives – looking at where they publish and spend the most &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; evaluating how mission aligned those outlets are. It’s not easy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: So, what are your expectations about the choices that libraries will make with regard to the PLOS Collective Action Publishing scheme?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;SR: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s totally dependent on region, funding structures (block grants in UK versus how the US does it) and how radical libraries want to be about cancelation and re-negotiations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I have personally been overwhelmed by the number of cash strapped organisations that are pushing to support this model and find the money.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The December commitment update will tell the tale!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Thank you. And good luck!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;                             &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Samuel Sutton will talk about the paper &quot;Navigation Along Windborne Plumes of Pheromone and Resource-Linked Odors&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many insects locate resources such as a mate, a host, or food by flying upwind along the odor plumes that these resources emit to their source. A windborne plume has a turbulent structure comprised of odor filaments interspersed with clean air. As it propagates downwind, the plume becomes more dispersed and dilute, but filaments with concentrations above the threshold required to elicit a behavioral response from receiving organisms can persist for long distances. Flying insects orient along plumes by steering upwind, triggered by the optomotor reaction. Sequential measurements of differences in odor concentration are unreliable indicators of distance to or direction of the odor source. Plume intermittency and the plume's fine-scale structure can play a role in setting an insect's upwind course. The prowess of insects in navigating to odor sources has spawned bioinspired virtual models and even odor-seeking robots, although some of these approaches use mechanisms that are unnecessarily complex and probably exceed an insect's processing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christmas is likely to be very different this year, with many family reunions potentially taking place remotely&lt;/strong&gt;. But why do we struggle so much with the idea of a “digital Christmas”?  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/nov/01/why-a-digital-christmas-goes-against-our-instincts&quot;&gt;David Robson takes a look&lt;/a&gt; at what the psychology has to say at &lt;em&gt;The Observer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40767&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many efforts to “nudge” people’s behaviour don’t work — but &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/25/behavioural-nudges-are-ineffective-at-encouraging-commuters-to-carpool-or-take-the-bus/&quot;&gt;as we’ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, it’s important that even failed attempts are published so that we can learn from them. &lt;/strong&gt;Now a new study has found that these failed interventions often share common features, such as an emphasis on encouraging people to behave in line with social norms, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2258396-what-can-we-learn-from-failed-attempts-to-change-peoples-behaviour&quot;&gt;reports Layal Liverpool at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could Alzheimer’s disease be triggered by microbes like the herpes virus?&lt;/strong&gt; At &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03084-9&quot;&gt;Alison Abbott has a feature&lt;/a&gt; exploring what was once a “fringe theory”, but which researchers are now beginning to take seriously.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial neural networks took their inspiration from the way that the brain processes information &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; and now they are helping to us understand more about those brain pathways&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/deep-neural-networks-are-helping-decipher-how-brains-work/&quot;&gt;Anil Ananthaswamy explores the parallels between the brain and these models&lt;/a&gt; in a longread at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whether a psychology study supports a liberal or conservative worldview seems to make no difference to how replicable it is. &lt;/strong&gt;That’s according to an analysis of nearly 200 studies which &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/02/has-the-liberal-bias-in-psychology-contributed-to-the-replication-crisis/&quot;&gt;we reported on last year&lt;/a&gt; when it was still in pre-print form. Now the paper has been published and the authors, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/researchers-politics-dont-undermine-their-scientific-results/&quot;&gt;Diego Reinero and Jay Van Bavel, have written an interesting summary&lt;/a&gt; over at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychologists are trying to better understand the experience of people who hear voices, in order to make sure that they receive the support they need&lt;/strong&gt;. Those who hear voices can end up withdrawing from others and feeling isolated, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/hearing-voices-can-be-frightening-and-isolating-but-talking-can-help-148953&quot;&gt;writes researcher Bryony Sheaves&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation &lt;/em&gt;—&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;but it can help to have support in the form of social connection, and for other people to be open to conversations about their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a lot of hype about the potential clinical or cognitive benefits of electrical brain stimulation — much of it unfounded&lt;/strong&gt;. At &lt;em&gt;Psyche&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyche.co/ideas/these-are-truly-exciting-times-for-the-science-of-brain-zapping&quot;&gt;Hannah Filmer takes a measured but optimistic look&lt;/a&gt; at the future of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/Blog-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contemporary society, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/whoqol-qualityoflife/en/&quot;&gt;quality of life (QoL)&lt;/a&gt; is a term used by economists, politicians, and people working across a range of other sectors and fields.  It is a concept used to measure the well-being of a population and societies, with various dimensions that can include material living situation and the environment, as well as subjective perceptions of an individual’s level of contentment with their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To healthcare professionals, quality of life has a more specific meaning, and is sometimes referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/hrqol/index.htm&quot;&gt;Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)&lt;/a&gt;. HRQoL is an individual’s perception of how they view their general health status which includes physical wellness, emotional well-being, and social functioning. HRQoL is now frequently used in the clinical setting to monitor the quality of healthcare services given to patients, as patients are increasingly recognised as the centre of the healthcare system in today’s era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A patient’s self-reported HRQoL has been shown to provide a good measure of their overall health status; reflecting their disease burden, mental well-being and social wellness that they experience. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that for patients with various health conditions, their self-report of HRQoL provides a good measure of their future health outcomes. What is less clear however, is whether HRQoL could also be used in the general community population, rather than just patients, to predict an individual’s future health; and thus, to help identify those individuals who are at risk of poorer health outcomes and where active interventions might be required. A systematic review is needed to provide robust evidence to address this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cochrane.org/news/what-are-systematic-reviews&quot;&gt;A systematic review&lt;/a&gt; is important because it provide a comprehensive summary that includes all of the published studies which have investigated a given research question. For this reason, it is considered less prone to bias, including all relevant data rather than selecting data which confirms an existing hypothesis. Therefore, the finding from a clearly defined and robustly conducted systematic review can provide solid evidence which can then be used for developing clinical recommendations and making evidence-based policies. This was the premise for our study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We undertook the first systematic review to determine whether an individual’s HRQoL was a good predictor of their future risk of dying. Our review included data from 47 studies with a total of approximately 1,200,000 participants living in the community (both with and without existing health conditions). Most participants were aged 65 years and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies varied in their duration, with some being very short (9 months between when the HRQoL was measured and death was recorded), and others much longer, by following participants for up to 18 years after HRQoL was assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study found that individuals who reported poorer HRQoL were more likely to die and in a shorter time. Interestingly, we found that poorer physical HRQoL rather than mental HRQoL was most predictive of their risk of dying during the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we suggest that doctors should incorporate a HRQoL questionnaire into an annual screening checklist for individuals attending their clinical practice. This could be used to identify individuals at higher risk for future adverse health outcomes, and who may not otherwise be detected. This practice could in turn enable initiation of active interventions for those individuals at high risk of poorer health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How do children learn to fear things that aren’t obviously scary, but that do pose a threat — to learn, say, that touching the base of a lit barbecue is a very bad idea, so should never be done? A parent might explain that it’s dangerously hot. But as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74170-1&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; explores in detail, we also benefit from another more direct, wordless method of learning about threats. Or rather, we may typically benefit from it — but, Marie-France Marin at the University of Quebec and her colleagues argue, it might also help to explain how anxiety disorders are transmitted down through generations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40758&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Marin and her team set out to explore so-called vicarious learning between 83 child-parent pairs. This entails learning by observing another person’s reactions to objects or events. So if a child sees a parent flinch after touching  a lit barbecue, despite never having experienced that pain themselves, they can learn never to do it. The team wanted to look, though, at how this type of learning might manifest at the physiological level. Fear and anxiety are characterised by an increase in physiological arousal — a raised heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and so on — all of which gear up the individual for fight or flight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For this study, the team focused on skin conductance as an indicator of general physiological arousal. Each parent was fitted with sensors to measure this, as well as electrodes that were set to deliver an “annoying” rather than painful shock. The parent was then videotaped while they watched, via a monitor, a lamp that flashed various colours. When one particular colour flashed (either red or blue), five times out of eight the parent received a shock. When another colour (yellow) was flashed, a shock was never administered. They learned, then, to associate one particular colour with receiving a shock, and one with being safe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each child was shown the video of their own parent’s reactions and also a video of a stranger of the same sex as their parent undergoing the same procedure. (The shocks were associated with a different colour for the stranger and parent: if the parent was shocked when a red light flashed, for instance, the stranger was shocked when the blue light flashed). The child was then put in the same experimental set-up as the adults, except that they were never actually shocked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The skin conductance data showed that children reacted with alarm to the red and blue lights, but not the yellow light. They had, then, learned to fear the colours associated with a shock to either their parent or a stranger. This suggests that children can learn from any adult, at least to some extent. But the team also found that children who showed greater “physiological synchrony” with their parent — so the child’s shifts in skin conductance levels more closely mirrored those of its parent during the course of the experiment — had stronger alarm reactions when they saw their parent being shocked. This suggests that children who are better “tuned” into their parents’ emotional states vicariously learn fear faster. (Exactly what underpins “better tuning” is not clear, but the quality of the parent/child relationship and the expressiveness of the adult will play a role.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the real world, the team notes, “parents transmit a lot of information to their children through their body language and their reactions to environmental stimuli”. If a parent responds appropriately to objects or events in the environment — signalling an appropriate level of fear or pain in response to something that is genuinely dangerous, but not to non-threats — then the child will clearly benefit. However, if the parent has a fear or anxiety disorder and becomes afraid or anxious when there is no genuine threat, their child could then learn these inappropriate responses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders often emerge in childhood, with a median age of onset of 11. “Given that [the] risk for anxiety and fear-based disorders is transmitted within families, it is essential to study how children form fearful associations when learning from their parent’s experience,” the researchers stress. Clearly, there’s more work to be done to understand these processes, but this research suggests that the level of physiological synchrony between a child and parent has an influence. This is an area that the team now plans to explore further, in the hope of finding new approaches to preventing or treating anxiety disorders in children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74170-1&quot;&gt; Vicarious conditioned fear acquisition and extinction in child–parent dyads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest episode of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/11/03/episode-22-drifting-minds-maladaptive-daydreaming-and-the-hypnagogic-state/&quot;&gt;PsychCrunch podcast&lt;/a&gt; explores the blurry boundaries between wakefulness and dreaming. Presenter Ella Rhodes examines that strange transition period between being awake and falling asleep known as hypnagogia. She also learns about maladaptive daydreaming, a condition in which people can lose themselves in their daydreams for hours at a time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To coincide with the release of the podcast, we’ve examined five strange findings about dreaming from the psychology literature:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40745&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Bad dreams are nothing to fear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No one likes a bad dream, but they do serve a purpose: research suggests that they prepare us to better face our fears. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.24843&quot;&gt;This finding comes from a two-part study&lt;/a&gt;. First, participants slept with EEG electrodes fitted to their heads. Several times in the night, they were woken by the researchers, who asked them about the content and emotional tone of any dreams. The team found that the key brain regions that are active when someone is feeling fear are the same whether they are awake or dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up experiment, a fresh group of participants were shown a series of upsetting images, such as pictures of assaults. The more fear they’d experienced during their previous night’s sleep, the less fear they felt in response to these images. Dream fear had, it seems, reined in their fear reactions in waking life. “Dreams may be considered as real training for our future reactions and may potentially prepare us to face real life dangers,” says researcher Lampros Perogamvros at the University of Geneva.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. You can control your dreams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During a so-called lucid dream, the dreamer realises that they are dreaming and can control what happens. There has been no end of attempts to find ways to induce lucid dreams — mostly unsuccessfully. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/drm0000059&quot;&gt;a study at the University of Adelaide, Australia&lt;/a&gt;, that explored a few potential techniques found that one was effective. When used in the five minutes immediately before falling asleep, the “MILD” (mnemonic induction of lucid dreams) technique worked 46 % of the time. It consists of simply repeating (to yourself) the phrase: “The next time I’m dreaming, I will remember that I’m dreaming.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. People who no longer think can still dream&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auto-activation deficit is a condition, caused by damage to the basal ganglia, in which people not only report having no thoughts, but have lost all self-motivation. They have to be told by carers to do everything from brushing their teeth to eating. However, even though their mind is a blank while they’re awake, &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/136/10/3076/329883&quot;&gt;research published by a team in France&lt;/a&gt;, shows that some, at least, do still dream. This group was much less likely to experience REM-stage dreams than healthy people, and the dreams they did have were lacking the complexity and emotion that characterises typical dreams. But they did still have some dreams. For example, one patient dreamed of shaving (something he could no longer do by himself), while another dreamed of writing, although, while awake, he never wrote anything without being instructed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The simplicity of these patients’ dreams (together with the identification of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2014.00187/full&quot;&gt;a role for the basal ganglia in integrating information from various brain regions&lt;/a&gt;) supports the “bottom-up” theory of dreaming — that dreams are initiated by activity in the brainstem, which is then followed by cortical input, which allows for complex emotional and sensory experiences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Certain drugs can allow you to “dream” while awake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The psychedelic drug DMT (one of the main psychoactive constituents of ayahuasca) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-51974-4&quot;&gt;produces brain rhythms that look at lot like those observed during dreaming&lt;/a&gt;. The team behind this finding reported that, compared with participants who’d received a placebo, the DMT group had much less alpha wave activity (the dominant electrical rhythm while we are awake) and also showed an increase in theta waves, which are associated with dreaming. “From the altered brainwaves and the participants’ reports, it’s clear these people are completely immersed in their experience,” comments lead researcher, Christopher Timmermann at Imperial College, London. “It’s like daydreaming only far more vivid and immersive — it’s like dreaming but with your eyes open.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Some people’s daydreams take over their lives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For some people, their daydreams are so vivid and absorbing that “real life” fades into the background. &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/06/25/people-with-maladaptive-daydreaming-spend-an-average-of-four-hours-a-day-lost-in-their-imagination/&quot;&gt;As one sufferer of Maladaptive Daydreaming (MD) explains it&lt;/a&gt;: “I am careful to control my actions in public so it is not evident that my mind is constantly spinning these stories and I am constantly lost in them.” Although MD does not feature in standard mental health diagnostic manuals, there are online &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MaladaptiveDreaming/&quot;&gt;communities &lt;/a&gt;dedicated to it. And as the researchers behind a recent study on MD write in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5962718/&quot;&gt;their paper&lt;/a&gt;, “in recent years it has gradually become evident that daydreaming can evolve into an extreme and maladaptive behaviour, up to the point where it turns into a clinically significant condition.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a bid to better understand the mental health factors that accompany MD, Eli Somer at the University of Haifa, Israel and Nirit Soffer-Dudek at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev studied 77 self-diagnosed sufferers. The pair found that obsessive-compulsive symptoms predicted the intensity and duration of maladaptive daydreaming on the following day. However, few participants actually suffered from obsessive compulsive &lt;em&gt;disorder&lt;/em&gt;, suggesting that while the two may share some common mechanisms, MD isn’t simply a type of OCD. The next step is to develop strategies to help sufferers control their daydreaming, so that it no longer constitutes a disorder. You can hear Soffer-Dudek talk more about her work in &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/11/03/episode-22-drifting-minds-maladaptive-daydreaming-and-the-hypnagogic-state/&quot;&gt;this week’s podcast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why do business people promise to “reach out to KOLs” when they could simply say that they will contact leading experts? How come judges sometimes remark that they will hear trials “&lt;em&gt;in-camera&lt;/em&gt;” instead of just “in private”?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As infuriating as it can be, jargon actually performs a social function. By definition, jargon refers to language used by a particular group of people, in the place of more accessible words and phrases. And although that can make it frustrating and confusing for people &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in that group, if you are a member then it can help signal to others that you belong. People may also use jargon as a way of displaying their expertise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597820303666&quot;&gt;series of studies&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes&lt;/em&gt;, those who are of &lt;em&gt;low &lt;/em&gt;status within a group are also predisposed towards jargon-filled language. Zachariah Brown at Columbia University and colleagues found that these people appear to want to compensate for their lowly position by using language that is often associated with high status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40706&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one study, students doing a Master of Business Administration (MBA) were told that they were taking part in a competition to pitch a start-up idea. They could choose between two different descriptions of the start-up to submit: one which was full of jargon words and phrases (e.g. “obtain a first mover advantage”), and one which used equivalent plain English phrases (e.g. “become one of the first companies to…”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some participants were told that their competitors were recent graduates who had already started their own companies — so as MBA students they were of comparatively low status themselves. Others were told that their competitors were undergraduates — so in this case, participants were of higher status. The team found that 41% of the low-status participants went with the jargon-heavy description, compared to just 29% of the high-status participants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In another study, participants chatted online in pairs. One took the role of an academic researcher presenting their work at a conference. They were given a description of the work, which contained both jargon terms and what they meant in plain English (e.g. “&lt;em&gt;My work highlights that non-human primates exhibit bi-pedal locomotion, or two legged walking movements. They do this on both arboreal and terrestrial substrates (in trees and on the ground).&lt;/em&gt;”). In the low-status condition, the “researcher” was told that they worked at a small community college and were looked down upon by others in the field; in the high-status condition they were told they were a well-respected researcher at an Ivy League university.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other participant in the pair asked the researcher questions about their work; the team were interested in how often the researcher used jargon terms in their response. Once again, low-status researchers used significantly more jargon than high-status ones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To figure out &lt;em&gt;why &lt;/em&gt;low-status participants tended to use more jargon, the team asked another set of participants to again imagine themselves as either a high- or low-status researcher, and choose one of two titles for a presentation — as well as indicate why they made their decision. Low-status participants were again more likely to choose the option containing jargon. They also reported focusing more on how the audience would judge them, and this could explain why they chose the jargon option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall then, the work suggests that jargon use is “a novel form of status compensation”, allowing people to make up for their low status through their language choices. It’s obviously not the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; reason that people use jargon, but is one that hadn’t previously been considered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to look at language used naturally by high- and low-status group members outside of the lab, to figure out the extent to which this effect applies in day-to-day interactions. (The team did find that thesis titles from higher ranked universities used less jargon, providing some preliminary evidence that it does apply more widely, but more work is needed). And there’s still one big question left to answer: does jargon actually work to convince people that you are a higher-status group member — or does the audience just see through it?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597820303666&quot;&gt;Compensatory conspicuous communication: Low status increases jargon&lt;br /&gt;use&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Open Access Week returned this year, bringing back themes of equity and inclusivity to the forefront of the community once again, as it has done in the past. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This OA week PLOS coordinated and participated in a mix of activities to illustrate the positive impacts Open Access can have on the scientific community and explored strategies to ensure that Open Access truly is open for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Access Week 2020 with the Drexel Libraries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On October 20, Emily Chenette, &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;’s Deputy Editor-in-Chief was a  virtual speaker at Drexel Libraries’, &lt;a href=&quot;https://libcal.library.drexel.edu/event/7210114&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Open Access Supports ‘Good Science’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In this session, Emily explored questions such as: &lt;em&gt;what comes to mind when you think about good science? Is it reproducible? Impactful? Accessible? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discussion delved into what we mean when we talk about good science, and how Open Access supports the practice and publication of it. She also discussed the steps PLOS takes to ensure that published papers are open and accessible, reproducible, conducted ethically, and contribute to the base of academic knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;oembed-container oembed-container--video&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voices and opinions of OA advocates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout this year’s OA Week we saw a great number of people stand up and take part in a collection of online activities to share their thoughts in support of Open Access publishing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the great things about OA Week is hearing from the community with their thoughts and opinions on what matters to them most. A lot of those people took part in our daily polls: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PLOS/timelines/1319329649332228097&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is the most important reason to publish #OpenAccess?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/o-9OduVboF9QOXq6saZC97otQfC5R97hSqPGtUpC9K56cjUg0e4wG8YkKk6IKnhsS2BHv8_bBgF9YBHeU78WQ6Rl713YNkTIWW24CdNZ5EcP4Wichq8Z3PmpEiv4cxWMzBW6NOfb&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People also &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PLOS/timelines/1319288985231872006&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; their support and promoted the many benefits of OA, from international collaboration to the advantages of Open Data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9xH_-fRankrkXiEBwr9qqEYEaFNHCBh0pRVAXA4YCiOFp1-8q-5m9H0Dmo68Ic8tNyo7eTCPXKsAmc7f9vbeQnwiBpni8jCZsfl8C3cyHaEsrNn5pCui0cwLQV4VnH1d600uEJSu&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Visit our site to learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-access-week/&quot;&gt;Openness&lt;/a&gt; and find out how you can benefit from OA and help drive science forward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;468&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/yk3qsTMUVU79z1WPDIkNjjw12vW8bf9v0rWmVJLKeqfCSTIEA1w8gDTUriQH8wcekZP5G-8GMkQquFcy9j_htN3nMK5waPoMQHxlMU0sTJI78wxc2V6Z7RshSaZNcy4phRqIKjo7&quot; width=&quot;476&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Equity and Inclusivity in Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This OA Week we took the time to reflect on the importance of research accessibility and the many benefits of Open Access in our blog post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/building-equity-and-inclusivity-in-science/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open Access Week 2020: Building Equity and Inclusivity in Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t miss it! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS’ entire ethos is built on the idea of research being open to a global community, however, we know there’s still plenty of work for us to do to make things better for researchers across the world. In this post we highlight the benefits of OA and what PLOS can do to make our journals more inclusive, equitable and diverse for the scientific community as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/07/our-commitment-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/&quot;&gt;Read more on our plans for a more inclusive future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We will continue to make PLOS an increasingly more inclusive, transparent and diverse platform for researchers across the globe to showcase their crucial findings. A part of this work has already started as we aim to bridge the gap between researchers and Open Access with the introduction of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot;&gt;Community Action Publishing&lt;/a&gt; initiative and our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/&quot;&gt;institutional partnerships&lt;/a&gt;. Together with our latest message on &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/plos-and-transparency-including-plan-s-price-service-transparency-framework/&quot;&gt;price transparency&lt;/a&gt; we hope our latest opportunities and resources will help researchers open their research and trust in science. &lt;/p&gt;

 From Google's English:  &quot;Society needs humanistic knowledge. The humanities need to reach out to society. Therefore, for the sixth year in a row, the think tank Humtank awards the Humtank Prize to academics or institutions that have made a meritorious contribution to important humanities perspectives in society. This year's winner is the Royal Library, and this is the motivation:

 

The Royal Library (KB) has, by opening up its entire digitized newspaper archive on the internet during the corona pandemic, paved the way into the future. In a time marked by copyright and commercial tunnel events, KB gave everyone the opportunity to explore almost 400 years of Swedish news reporting and history - regardless of where they are in the country. A temporary copyright agreement meant that the entire archive could only be accessed freely for a few months, but through the initiative, the library has opened a wide window, which no researcher or good citizen wants to see closed anymore. In a far-sighted and meritorious way, KB has thus shown a genuinely digitized future, where history is free and accessible for everyone to explore.&quot;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the UK, the clocks went back last weekend and we’re now faced with dark, gloomy evenings. &lt;/strong&gt;But around the world, many countries have decided that the time has come to abolish clock changes. And there are good reasons for doing so, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/governments-worldwide-consider-ditching-daylight-saving-time/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciam%2Fmind-and-brain+%28Topic%3A+Mind+%26+Brain%29&quot;&gt;Beth Malow tells Diana Kwon at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: changing the clocks throws our circadian rhythms out, which can affect our sleep and stress response&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40684&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who generally do more “media multitasking” — using social media while watching TV, for instance — showed more lapses of attention during a recall task in a recent study,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsci.com/story/science/media-multitasking-memory-neuroscience/&quot;&gt;reports Kat Eschner&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Popular Science. &lt;/em&gt;The results suggest that media multitasking could be related to poorer concentration and memory — but as the story notes, there are plenty of unanswered questions about the direction of causality, as well as the suitability of the measures used in this kind of work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a relatively rare subtype of dementia called “autoimmune dementia”, caused by antibodies binding to brain tissue. &lt;/strong&gt;It may often be misdiagnosed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/25/the-dementia-that-can-be-cured&quot;&gt;writes David Cox at &lt;em&gt;The Observer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — but the good news is that, once identified, it is treatable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study of UK MPs and councillors reveals the extent to which politicians have to engage in “emotional labour”,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/burn-out-the-emotional-toll-of-being-a-politician-revealed-146323&quot;&gt;writes researcher James Weinberg&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, the majority of those surveyed said that they frequently had to be artificially friendly or act nice to others, no matter how they were treated themselves. Consistent with findings from other professions, women seemed to end up taking on more of this emotional labour than men.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new tool for studying the human brain has recently been added to the neuroscientist’s toolbox: brain organoids, rudimentary brain-like structures grown in the lab from stem cells&lt;/strong&gt;. But the use of these “mini-brains” also brings up tricky ethical issues. At &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02986-y&quot;&gt;Sara Reardon asks&lt;/a&gt; at what point a collection of brain cells becomes conscious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meanwhile, optogenetics, in which neurons can be activated using light, continues to produce scientific insights — in rodents, at least. &lt;/strong&gt;It’s been much more challenging to use the technique in primate studies, however, which are an important step towards developing optogenetics-based therapies for humans. But researchers hope a new open data initiative will help, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/10/controlling-monkey-brains-light-could-get-easier-thanks-open-data-project&quot;&gt;writes Kelly Servick&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One last interesting neuroscience study from this week: scientists have created a brain-computer interface by attaching electrodes onto a stent, which they then threaded into a blood vessel in the brain. &lt;/strong&gt;The technology enabled patients with paralysis to click a cursor on a computer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/a-new-way-to-plug-a-human-brain-into-a-computer-via-veins/&quot;&gt;reports Adam Rogers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired,&lt;/em&gt; allowing them to text and shop online.&lt;/p&gt;

As of this writing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1,188,259&lt;/span&gt; people&lt;/a&gt; around the world have died from COVID-19, including 234,218 in the United States. In the dark days of April, the death rate was over 20%. Although this has declined dramatically (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;to 3%&lt;/a&gt;), it’s utterly reckless to minimize the risks of coronavirus and flaunt every mitigation strategy endorsed by infectious disease specialists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/k3lV4BzOVZg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;He's like an evil Oprah&lt;/a&gt;. You're getting COVID. And you're getting COVID!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One might think that contracting and recovering from COVID-19 would be a sobering experience for most people, but not for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-life-works/#LatePeriWrit1883&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i lang=&quot;de&quot; title=&quot;Trump: 'All I know is I took something, whatever the hell it was.

A recent study by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journalism.org/2020/10/07/before-trump-tested-positive-for-coronavirus-republicans-attention-to-pandemic-had-sharply-declined/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt; found major differences in how Democrats and Republicans view the severity of COVID-19. Results from the survey (conducted Aug. 31-Sept. 7, 2020) were no surprise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LeBnLWFPs8A/X5tMk1sF61I/AAAAAAAANOU/phLablBUX8MGrR3NHvsAu_WixPe7VFQDwCLcBGAsYHQ/s502/Pew%2Bpartisan%2Bdivide%2Bon%2BCOVID-19.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;258&quot; data-original-width=&quot;502&quot; height=&quot;205&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LeBnLWFPs8A/X5tMk1sF61I/AAAAAAAANOU/phLablBUX8MGrR3NHvsAu_WixPe7VFQDwCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h205/Pew%2Bpartisan%2Bdivide%2Bon%2BCOVID-19.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as we know, Democrats and Republicans exist in alternate universes constructed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-10/uosc-mtc100820.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;non-overlapping media sources&lt;/a&gt; (CNN vs. Fox, to oversimplify), which in turn correlates with whether they wear masks, practice social distancing, and avoid crowds. A new paper in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6516/533&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Finkel et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;) integrated data from multiple disciplines to examine the partisan political environment in the US. They found that Democratic and Republican voters have become:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“...&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EliJFinkel/status/1321877196533882886&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;POLITICALLY SECTARIAN&lt;/a&gt; -- fervently committed to a political identity characterized by three properties: &lt;b&gt;(1) othering&lt;/b&gt; (opposing partisans are alien to us), &lt;b&gt;(2) aversion&lt;/b&gt; (they are dislikable &amp;amp; untrustworthy), and &lt;b&gt;(3) moralization&lt;/b&gt; (they are iniquitous).”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors concluded that the combination of all &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6516/533&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;three core ingredients&lt;/a&gt; is especially toxic.

But, in combination, they instill a sense of dread -- a sense that political losses are existential threats that must be averted, no matter the cost.&lt;/p&gt;— Eli Finkel (@EliJFinkel) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EliJFinkel/status/1321877198391988229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 29, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perfect! Dread and existential threat to a fervent political identity during a pandemic that reminds us of our own mortality.

Awareness of death or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_salience&quot;&gt;mortality salience&lt;/a&gt; —  pondering the inevitability of your own death, a time when you will no longer exist — triggers anxiety, according the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065260115000052&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Terror Management Theory&lt;/a&gt; (TMT). In response to this threat, humans react in ways to boost their self-esteem and reinforce their own values (and punish outsiders). These cognitive processes are conceptualized as nebulous “defenses”  [&lt;i&gt;nebulous to me, at least&lt;/i&gt;] that are deployed to minimize terror. Notably, however, experimental manipulation of mortality salience did &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; affect “worldview defense” in the large-scale &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cos.io/blog/many-labs-4-failure-replicate-mortality-salience-effect-and-without-original-author-involvement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Many Labs 4&lt;/a&gt; replication project, which throws cold water on this aspect of TMT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Predictive Coding and Perceived Risk of COVID-19&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alternative view of how we disassociate ourselves from death awareness is provided by predictive coding theory. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23663408/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Whatever next? Predictive brains, situated agents, and the future of cognitive science (Clark 2013)&quot;&gt;influential framework&lt;/a&gt; hypothesizes that the brain is constantly generating and updating its models of the world based on top-down “biases” and bottom-up sensory input (Clark, 2013):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23663408/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brains ... are essentially prediction machines&lt;/a&gt;. They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions. This is achieved using a hierarchical generative model that aims to minimize prediction error within a bidirectional cascade of cortical processing. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prediction errors are minimized by perceptual inference (updating predictions to better match the input) or active inference (sampling the input in a biased fashion to better ﬁt the predictions). A recent paper considered this framework with regard to beliefs generated during the pandemic, and how they're related to health precautions adopted by individuals to mitigate spread of the virus (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7242918/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bottemanne et al, 2020&lt;/a&gt;). This paper was conceptual (not computational), and it was written in French (meaning I had to read it using Google translate). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In brief, pandemics are massive sources of uncertainty. There was a delay in the perception of risk, followed by unrealistic optimism (“certainly &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; do not &lt;span class=&quot;tlid-translation translation&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;run the risk of becoming infected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tlid-translation translation&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;”) despite the growing accumulation of evidence to the contrary. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tlid-translation translation&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tlid-translation translation&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The reduced perception of risk leads people to flaunt precautionary mandates, even in France (which is currently showing a greater spike in cases than the US).

&lt;p&gt;Authors can now submit their work using &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/24/tex-live-2020-release-oct-1-2020/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TeXLive 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the most recent version of the TeX open source markup language that enables precision formatting for academic writing. The rollout was seamless, with zero interruptions in service. TeXLive 2020 — and, psst, an upcoming TeX log error highlighting feature — make submission smoother for authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;arXivLabs logo&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-682 size-thumbnail&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/09/arxivlabs-icon-150x150.png&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/28/arxivlabs-a-space-for-community-innovation/&quot;&gt;arXivLabs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – a new framework for collaboration – was launched. Plus, exciting new functionality was released in the arXivLabs tabs section of the abstract record page. Based on user feedback, it’s fabs. Code can now be linked to articles, thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/08/new-arxivlabs-feature-provides-instant-access-to-code/&quot;&gt;Papers with Code&lt;/a&gt; collaboration.  Readers can also now easily check out articles that match their interest when they activate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/15/core-recommender-now-supports-article-discovery-on-arxiv/&quot;&gt;CORE Recommender&lt;/a&gt;. Community collaboration and cutting-edge features are important to authors and readers – which means they’re important to the arXiv team too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/05/new-classifier-adds-transparency-to-arxiv-submission-process/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;new classifier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was integrated into the submission system. This helps place papers in the right category, which is critical to helping research reach the right audience. The author experience didn’t change with this upgrade, but – bonus! – this classifier code is totally transparent and publicly available so that others can build up on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHfuvUxmHx4&amp;amp;t=3s&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image of arXiv Video Screenshot&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-749&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-22-at-9.49.53-AM-150x150.png&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;arXiv celebrated &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/22/open-access-in-the-covid-19-era-oaweek-panel-discussion/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International Open Access Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a panel discussion on open access in the COVID-19 era, and, if you missed it, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/22/open-access-in-the-covid-19-era-oaweek-panel-discussion/&quot;&gt;recap and video are available&lt;/a&gt;. This event also kicked off &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/19/giving-week-why-arxiv/&quot;&gt;Giving Week&lt;/a&gt;, arXiv’s first community fundraiser since the pandemic began. We were heartened to receive nearly 1400 individual donations, ranging from $5 to $1000. Each and every gift helps ensure that arXiv remains a non-commercial, community resource. &lt;strong&gt;Thank you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, and certainly not least, arXiv hosted its very first &lt;strong&gt;virtual board meeting&lt;/strong&gt;, where members of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/people/scientific_ad_board&quot;&gt;Scientific Advisory Board&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/about/people/member_ad_board&quot;&gt;Member Advisory Board&lt;/a&gt; gathered to hear about updates, plans, challenges and opportunities — and provide their valuable insights. The meeting was intense and fruitful, with discussions ranging from big picture strategy to daily operations like moderator recruitment. Some of our board members have volunteered in this capacity for more than a decade, and we’re grateful that they continually inspire the staff to serve authors, readers, and open science. &lt;strong&gt;Thank you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Over four years ago we launched PLOS Channels to highlight research and news relevant to our research communities. Eventually, the portfolio grew to include 13 Channels in topics from stem cells to tuberculosis to cholera (see the full list below). New content was added to Channels by expert Channel Editors, who selected articles to include in a journal- and publisher-agnostic manner. Channels were initially conceived as a meaningful space to serve a variety of communities beyond typical journal boundaries and challenge the assessment of impact and importance of research.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, we are announcing that we have made the difficult decision to stop updating the Channels. Despite positive feedback from some authors and their institutions, we have not seen the usage from the community that would allow us to achieve our goals. Moreover, we were not able to scale the program to meet everyone’s needs, and we suspect that post-publication curation of content may be best done by a neutral third party, rather than an organisation like PLOS, which publishes some of the content included in the Channels. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The content in all Channels will be archived and will remain available online. The following two Channels will migrate to PLOS Curated Collections, where they will continue to be updated with relevant research from PLOS to connect people to content and inspire collaboration:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;–      &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/vdrrc&quot;&gt;  Veterans Disability &amp;amp; Rehabilitation Research&lt;/a&gt;: to maintain our commitment to the Veteran’s Administration&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;–      &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/dfs&quot;&gt;  Disease Forecasting &amp;amp; Surveillance&lt;/a&gt;: because the current pandemic demonstrates the essential nature of this content, and its curation. This Channel will be renamed to Infectious Disease Epidemiology to ensure that all relevant content on this important topic is included.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS would not exist without the people who believe in our mission and values, and who help us with  projects like Channels. We rely on scientists like our Channel Editors to keep pushing us on our collective journey to make science more open, accessible and transparent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On behalf of everyone at PLOS, we want to thank all our Channel Editors and Administrators (past &amp;amp; present) for their tireless work and dedication and all of the loyal subscribers who have followed PLOS Channels over the years. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! You have truly enriched our organization and science as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/29/men-who-sleep-less-are-seen-as-more-masculine-a-stereotype-with-potentially-damaging-consequences/"/>

		<updated>2020-10-29T16:18:02+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are some curious cultural ideas around sleep, namely that there’s something virtuous or impressive about not getting very much of it. “Burnout” is often shorthand for success: if you’re successful it follows that you’re also pretty busy, in which case you’re less likely to get enough sleep. Margaret Thatcher famously boasted that she only needed to sleep four hours a night, as has Donald Trump — though whether that bolsters or damages the prestige associated with sleepless nights probably depends on your politics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There may also be links between sleep and perceptions of masculinity, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/711758&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Association for Consumer Research&lt;/em&gt; suggests. In a number of studies, Nathan B. Warren and Troy H. Campbell from the University of Oregon found that not only do we associate sleep deprivation with masculinity, but that men who sleep less actually experience more favourable social judgements than their better-rested counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40666&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 144 participants were asked to imagine a man shopping for a bed; when approached by a salesperson, the man is asked how much he sleeps. Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: in one, the man answers that he sleeps a lot, while in the other he states that he sleeps very little. After hearing the man’s answer, participants rated how masculine they felt he was — and when participants heard that he had lots of sleep, masculinity ratings were significantly lower than in the little sleep condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, participants were asked to describe either a masculine or non-masculine man’s habits and behaviours: what he would like to do for fun, for example, as well as how much sleep he would get on average. As in the first study, there was a link: those in the masculine condition described their character sleeping for 33 minutes less than the non-masculine character.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team then explored &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; men who sleep less are seen as less masculine. They asked 207 participants to describe a man who either gets “lots of sleep” or “little sleep”, rating his character on seven measures of agency (e.g. “he is individualistic” or “he is assertive”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again, participants rated men who sleep a lot as significantly less masculine than those who sleep a little. But participants’ perceptions of agency seemed to be key to this link: characters who sleep a lot were described as having less agency than those who sleep a little, and this in turn led people to rate those characters as less masculine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A later study looked at social judgements: are men who sleep more judged more harshly than those who sleep less? Participants were asked how American society would judge various people (e.g. “athletes” and “adult males”) if they either slept  “a lot” or ”very little”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As predicted, men who sleep a lot were evaluated more negatively than those who sleep a little, while there was no difference for women. Interestingly, judgements across other categories were uneven — athletes were positively evaluated when they slept a lot, whilst lawyers were more favourably looked upon when they slept a little. A subsequent study again showed that perceptions of agency and masculinity were important when making these social judgments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the team found that even self-evaluations were influenced by stereotypes about sleep and masculinity. Men who imagined telling another person that they slept more than average felt significantly less masculine than those who imagined saying they slept less than average.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key factor in understanding why there is such a strong link between sleep and perceived masculinity, the team argues, is &lt;em&gt;agency.&lt;/em&gt; Many facets of agency are considered to be stereotypically masculine — assertiveness, individualism, orientation towards goals — compared to the more “feminine” traits of empathy or affection. If you’re goal-oriented and assertive, you’re likely to be someone who strives to use their time efficiently — which is where the perceived link between success, sleep and masculinity might come into play.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those who aren’t particularly interested in abiding by gender stereotypes or reject them altogether, the results probably don’t make much difference. But if men are sleeping less because of worries around masculinity, they could face some seriously negative consequences:  physical or mental health issues have often been linked to poor sleep. Challenging stereotypes of masculinity and femininity, as in so many other areas, may prove beneficial when it comes to persuading men it’s alright to have a good night’s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/711758&quot;&gt;The Sleep-Deprived Masculinity Stereotype&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Kucfd8ARAo8/"/>
		<id>https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18507</id>
		<updated>2020-10-27T14:19:18+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;PLOS has received a grant from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloan.org/&quot;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sloan.org/&quot;&gt; P. Sloan Foundation&lt;/a&gt; to study how researchers evaluate both the &lt;strong&gt;credibility &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;impact &lt;/strong&gt;of research outputs (e.g. articles, preprints, data, and code). We will be conducting this research in partnership with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ascb.org/&quot;&gt;American Society for Cell Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(ASCB).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ll be looking at this in two contexts: (1) when researchers are &lt;em&gt;discovering &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;reading &lt;/em&gt;these outputs in the process of their own research, and (2) when they are &lt;em&gt;assessing &lt;/em&gt;these outputs while participating in grant application review panels and hiring committees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are interested in characterizing the steps that researchers go through to form judgments of both credibility and impact in these two contexts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Why is this new research needed?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous research has explored the factors that influence trust and how researchers decide which articles to read and cite, showing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.3233/ISU-140725&quot;&gt;personal inspection&lt;/a&gt;, social clues, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1087/20140206&quot;&gt;peer review&lt;/a&gt;, are important. Recently, preprints have created new challenges for researchers who evaluate large amounts of new information outside of the traditional framework of journal peer review. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/kabux&quot;&gt;survey by the Center for Open Science&lt;/a&gt; suggested that cues related to Open Science content (e.g. signaling open availability of data) and independent verification are important for judging credibility of preprints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet, the current system for assessing research is &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228914&quot;&gt;dominated by signifiers of &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228914&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Since impact cannot be known until after time has passed, various proxies have been used that signal perceived, or the potential for, impact such as publication in a high Impact Factor journal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS and other organizations, in particular the multi-stakeholder organization &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;DORA, &lt;/a&gt;have stressed the negative consequences of such a narrow focus on proxies of impact and the need for reform. Most problematically, researchers are pushed to place a higher priority on pursuing these proxies than on making their research &lt;strong&gt;credible&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;reproducible, &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;reusable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many have suggested that this focus on proxies for impact in research assessment is at least in part due to the &lt;strong&gt;practical limitations in evaluating credibility and impact&lt;/strong&gt;. By understanding what truly matters to researchers in forming these judgments, we hope to find insights that can inform better practice in research assessment, inspire better tools for researchers, and help us evolve how we signal the markers of credibility in the articles we publish.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Collaboration with ASCB&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are not undertaking this project alone! We are excited to be conducting this research in collaboration with the ASCB. This partnership helps maximize the connection of this project to the research community. As the organizational sponsor of DORA, ASCB is also a scientific association demonstrably dedicated to advocating sound research policies and improving research culture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;What comes after the research?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will publish a report on the insights obtained through this research. This report will have a CC BY license, with anonymized and aggregated data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future research might include a quantitative initiative to validate the findings with a broader group of researchers. Ultimately, we would like to understand if there are opportunities to better serve researchers’ needs to assess and discover new research than currently available methods. Therefore, we also hope that our initial report will prompt further research by others, which we believe is important for the research and scholarly communication communities. We are very thankful to the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation for their interest in this research project and dedicated support of &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloan.org/programs/digital-technology/scholarly-communication&quot;&gt;Scholarly Communication&lt;/a&gt; issues in general.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are confident that improvements to research assessment culture and practice are possible. And we also believe that there is no more important a moment to be doing this, as we experience a global crisis during which unbiased, rigorous, and credible research will play an unprecedented role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The successful research proposal was inspired and improved by conversations with many representatives from the research, funding, and publishing community. We wish to acknowledge and thank, in particular, Jessica Polka and Ron Vale for insightful discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence agents play ever more influential roles in our lives. As the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11924&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research&lt;/em&gt;, point out, they do everything from suggesting new friends and connections to recommending purchases and filtering the news that reaches us. They are even beginning to drive our cars. Another role that they are tipped to take over is negotiating on our behalf to sell a car, say, or resolve a legal dispute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, reasoned Jonathan Mell and colleagues at the Institute for Creative Technologies at the University of Southern California, it’s important to know whether using a bot might affect how we negotiate —and it turns out that it does. One of the most striking findings from the team’s series of studies is that less experienced negotiators are more willing to be deceitful if they assign an AI agent to do their dirty work for them. The studies also illuminate how our stance on various negotiating tactics alters through experience — information that would be needed to program negotiating bots to accurately represent us.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40649&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the first online study, 741 participants were asked about their experience in negotiating for good deals or prices. Then they were told to imagine that they were negotiating for something important to them, such as a house or a car. Next, they were told either that they would negotiate for themselves, or they would program a bot to do the job for them. They all then completed the team’s new Agent Negotiation Tactics Inventory (ANTI), indicating just how tough, deceptive and pleasant or otherwise they wanted to be (in the case of the first group) or wanted their bot to be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, they could endorse making an opening demand far greater than that they’d be willing to settle for (a “tough” stance) and/or convey a “positive disposition” or express sympathy with the opponent’s plight (and so come across as pleasant). But they could also indicate that they — or their agent — would “strategically express anger toward the opponent to extract concessions” or “convey dissatisfaction with the encounter so that the other party will think he/she is losing interest”. These are both examples of deceptive strategies. The team found that participants who thought about programming the agent to negotiate on their behalf endorsed deceptive tactics more than those thinking about negotiating for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second online study found that more negative previous negotiation experiences (arguing over a deal, for example) were linked to a greater willingness to use deceptive tactics across the board. For the final study, again run online, 190 participants completed the ANTI then engaged in a 10-minute negotiation using an online platform in which “players” must negotiate (using pre-written phrases, questions, statements and also emotion buttons) to split a number of items between them. Each player is told how much each item is worth to them, but they don’t know how much it’s worth to their opponent. In this study, each participant in fact went up against a bot, rather than a human player.  The bots had one of four different negotiating profiles: nice plus competitive, nice plus consensus-building, nasty plus competitive and nasty plus consensus-building. None, however, used any deceptive tactics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the end of the negotiation, the participants filled out the ANTI again, to indicate how they would behave next time. The team found that whether the agent was nice or nasty didn’t change the ANTI ratings. However, while interacting with a competitive “tough” agent increased endorsement of deceptive tactics, interacting with a “fair” consensus-building agent reduced intentions to be deceptive. Though the agents had not used deception, even brief experience with a hard-ball negotiator bot made the participants more willing to be underhand. As the researchers write, even if participants are initially keen for their representative to negotiate fairly, “exposure to the real world of aggressive, tough negotiators is enough make them forsake their qualms and embrace deception”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When designing future agents to accurately represent us in real-world negotiations, these findings should, then, be taken into account, the researchers say — the work suggests that bots should be programmed to become more deceptive in response to a tough negotiation. As the team writes, “Shying away from this during agent design could lead to unsatisfied users and would have severe implications for the adoption of future agent representative systems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11924&quot;&gt;The Effects of Experience on Deception in Human-Agent Negotiation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; style=&quot;width: 701px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;figure__image&quot; data-src=&quot;//media.nature.com/lw800/magazine-assets/d41586-020-02765-9/d41586-020-02765-9_18456700.jpg&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; src=&quot;https://media.nature.com/lw800/magazine-assets/d41586-020-02765-9/d41586-020-02765-9_18456700.jpg&quot; width=&quot;691&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Credit: Alexander Heinel/Picture Alliance/DPA&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;History was made this year when two women, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of a genome editing method using CRISPR-Cas9, which has numerous applications in the editing of plant and animal genomes. However, even before the discovery of CRISPR-Cas’ use in DNA editing, the use of genome editing techniques in humans has long been considered unethical, with many countries making it illegal to edit human embryos. In 2018, the highly-controversial birth of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07545-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;‘CRISPR babies’&lt;/a&gt; – twin girls allegedly born with CRISPR-edited genomes – shocked the world and renewed discussions about the ethics and legality of such practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using cystic fibrosis scenarios as functional examples, Schleidgen &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;explore three consistently-debated issues of human germline therapies in relation to CRISPR-Cas: the risks of using the tool in human germline editing, what responsibilities future generations bear and whether the treatment is legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors argue that categorically prohibiting the use of CRISPR-Cas ‘one-generation germline therapies’ – which would theoretically phenotypically cure the developing embryo, but ensure that the changes are not passed onto offspring – would not be legally or ethically justifiable, provided that concepts surrounding human germline editing are clarified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-020-01115-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Assessing risk of bias: a proposal for a unified framework for observational studies and randomized trials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently no unified guidelines to help individual healthcare professionals (and medical students) assess bias across different study types, an essential skill in the practice of evidence-based medicine. Study type-specific tools do currently exist, such as those that aid in the assessment of bias in observational studies, but can’t be reliably applied to other study types, such as randomized trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luijendijk &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; have identified this gap and also argue that current frameworks are limited in requiring only methodological knowledge to detect bias, as some study aspects may only be appraised using subject-matter knowledge. In order to generate a unified framework, they applied a popular conceptual framework typically used only in observational studies to randomized trials, by defining the research question in terms of study population, intervention and outcome, and using causal diagrams to illustrate how each source of bias can lead to over- or under-estimations of treatment effects. The developed framework allows for the identification of three sources of bias independent of study design: bias due to a common cause, bias due to systematic measurement error, and bias due to a common effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Since it was established that the composition of the human gut microbiome can have major impacts on our health, the field of research has rapidly grown; in the last 40 years,&lt;a href=&quot;https://gut.bmj.com/content/67/9/1716?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt; 80% of human gut microbiome research was published between 2013 and 2017.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacteria&lt;/em&gt; are relatively abundant in the human gut, and attract particular interest due to their potential for use as probiotics (live bacteria that are considered to be good for health) and as targets of prebiotics (substances that increase the abundance or activity of existing bacteria).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their study, Chung &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; investigated the effect of dietary supplementation of AXOS (arabinoxylan oligosaccharides, which have been demonstrated to promote the abundance of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacteria&lt;/em&gt;) on gut microbiota. They carried out a crossover, randomised, double-blind trial whereby the diets of elderly volunteers were supplemented with AXOS or maltodextrin, and their effects on faecal bacteria and blood serum parameters were measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The faecal samples analysed revealed an increase in &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacteria &lt;/em&gt;observed across the entire cohort in response to AXOS supplementation, independent of the observed inter-individual variation in gut microbiota. However, variation in the levels of baseline &lt;em&gt;Prevotella&lt;/em&gt; species of gut bacteria did determine how responsive each patient was to AXOS supplementation. The authors conclude that AXOS supplementation is bifidogenic, suggesting that AXOS may be considered a viable prebiotic option in the elderly, and due to the influence of existing gut bacteria on the bifidogenic response, call for the consideration of microbiota profiling when testing the efficacy of prebiotics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conventional cigarette smoking during pregnancy is linked to adverse effects on both mother and baby health, and is amongst one of the leading preventable causes of adverse birth outcomes. The difficulties of quitting smoking during pregnancy have led many to consider alternatives to conventional cigarettes, such as electronic or ‘e’ cigarettes. As they contain fewer toxic chemicals than conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes are largely believed to have fewer adverse health effects compared to traditional cigarettes, but there is little evidence to support this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors Sooyong Kim and Sanda Cristina Oancea sought to determine whether e-cigarettes are safer in pregnancy than conventional cigarettes, by extracting and analysing data from the PRAMS (Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System) study cohort, a large study that included data on 55,000 pregnancies. Participants were classified into three groups: complete tobacco abstinence, exclusive conventional cigarette use, and exclusive e-cigarette use, and adverse birth outcomes were defined as low birth weight, preterm birth and ‘small for gestational age’. They found that, when compared to conventional cigarette users, the risk of each adverse birth outcome was not significantly reduced, and e-cigarettes cannot be considered to be safer than conventional cigarettes. Following this, the authors encourage the complete abstinence from all tobacco products during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Dr. Luca Morgantini worked with a diverse group of researchers to survey healthcare professionals across the globe to study the degree of burnout they were experiencing. For their &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0238217&quot;&gt;Factors contributing to healthcare professional burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic: A rapid turnaround global survey&lt;/a&gt;, they surveyed 2,700 individuals across 60 countries in April 2020 and found that burnout had generally increased compared to pre-pandemic times. I asked Luca on whether there were any surprises he came across during this study, the scientific communities’ response to the crisis and more. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This paper seems outside the scope of your usual work. How did you get involved in this study and why do you believe this research is important?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LM: I decided to document the mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers the moment I saw non-medical parts of our society downplay what was happening in March, when the SARS-CoV-2 virus was starting to spread in Europe and North America. This research is important because we gathered data during the height of the pandemic, providing solid foundations for future healthcare policies while avoiding recall biases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was evident from the reports of my Chinese friends and colleagues how serious was this disease, with Wuhan going on lockdown in late January. I observed how the infection slowly spread to the rest of the world hitting Italy, my home country, particularly hard. I completed my medical training in Milan, where my colleagues found themselves working in the red zone without adequate protection or directives from their supervisors. Soon the pandemic reached the United States, where I am currently living. While study is outside my usual scope of work, as a healthcare professional and researcher I felt the need to play my part in the fight against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I note that you originally uploaded the manuscript to MedRxiv as a preprint. At what time in your career did you start thinking about Open Science, and why is it important to you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LM: I believe that Open Science is essential for a fair and accessible future of science. Paywalls and other accessibility restrictions disproportionally affect early-career investigators or individuals with less economic means. I have been personally impacted by these paywalls, as institutions often cannot offer a subscription to all the countless scientific publishers. I understand there is a delicate balance between accessibility and profit, but I am convinced that other business models are feasible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My team chose to publish a preprint on MedRxiv and then published our article on &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, because one of the purposes of our research is to make all our collected data freely available for other researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You additionally opted to publish your peer review history with your publication. What led you to this decision and how important do you think transparency of the review process is?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LM: We decided to publish the peer review history for two reasons. First, we believe this is a way to recognize the tremendous work done by the Editor and the Reviewers. They significantly contributed to the relevance of our manuscript by providing constructive comments, and we want to acknowledge their role in our publication by making their comments public.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, we believe in the importance of a transparent review process. This will allow other researchers investigating this field to understand what the concerns of the reviewers were.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you consider this research interdisciplinary? If so, how crucial are structures that support interdisciplinary review to the publication and dissemination of this type of research?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LM: Burnout is a complex phenomenon and an interdisciplinary approach allowed our team to evaluate it from different perspectives. My co-authors have different backgrounds in urology, psychiatry, biostatistics and epidemiology research. The heterogeneity of our team was essential in creating a short but comprehensive questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An interdisciplinary team of reviewers is important for the same reasons. Analyzing such complex arguments from different points of view is required to better assess the eventual limitations of each study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Were you particularly surprised by anything your study uncovered or were the results generally what you expected?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LM: To be honest, we were simply amazed by the number of healthcare professionals that participated in our study. I feel that they appreciated our process because we were as inclusive as possible, considering parts of the healthcare workforce and geographical areas that are often overlooked in healthcare research. From the comments we received, we noticed how they appreciated our effort to study their quality of work and life, and their willingness to make their COVID-19 experiences count.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most surprising results was the selflessness and dedication of healthcare workers: the vast majority is willing to continue working despite the obvious risk. Their main concern is not infecting themselves, but bringing the virus home to friends and loved ones. These results were consistent across all countries, genders, and healthcare professions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In your Conclusion, you mention a few actions that could potentially mitigate burnout for healthcare professionals. Are there any that you would particularly like to see pursued by institutions and other stakeholders?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LM: It is evident how our society and healthcare systems were not ready to withstand the first wave of a global pandemic. When the Spanish flu infected an estimated half a billion individuals around a century ago, the scientific community was only starting to understand what viruses are and how pandemics evolve. COVID-19 is the first true global pandemic where modern science can play an active and aware role. This is an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to document and understand how to improve the condition of frontline healthcare workers. The manuscript we published represents only one of the hundreds of studies that are being conducted on this topic that all together will contribute to mitigating the negative effects of future pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In particular, we observed how training was mostly reported to be ineffective and how adequate protective equipment was rarely available. We understood how healthcare workers are more concerned about their families than themselves, and future policies that would assure the safety of their loved ones, such as periodical testing, kindergartens, or short term rentals close to hospitals, would greatly improve their quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What have you seen from peers and the scientific community as a whole during the COVID-19 pandemic?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LM: Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific community is performing an extraordinary and unprecedented synergic effort towards improving diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. I felt this willingness to help and collaborate while conducting this research, where I received tremendous support from my institution, colleagues, and expert researchers. The lessons learned during these difficult times will greatly help our scientific community and will help build a collaborative and constructive future. I am grateful to be part of this collective scientific effort that is one of the positive lessons to be learnt from this pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Comments from the Editor&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Michio Murakami, PLOS ONE Academic Editor from the Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, speaks on the significance of Luca’s work and the need to work through differences to improve our world. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MM: Among the many published COVID-19-related papers, the paper by Morgantini et al. is particularly significant. First, they conducted a rapid survey of 60 countries, highlighting that burnout of healthcare professionals is an important issue around the world. Second, it points out the importance of training and organizational support as a solution to address burnout. Ultimately, the paper points out an issue that is shared globally and presents findings that can lead to solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 and the associated social response pose a diverse range of physical and socio-psychological health problems. Some of these issues relate to discrimination, prejudice and social division. Different values and cultural worldviews, depending on the identity and position of individuals and groups, may lead to different opinions and social division. We need to be respectful of our values to individuals and different groups, and increase awareness of the fact that society is built on mutual reciprocity. There are shared goals and a vision of the world we can aspire to, even though our values may differ.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, there are many aspects of our health that is supported by healthcare professionals, and none of us want a world in which many healthcare professionals leave their work. This paper by Morgantini et al. provides useful insights on this global issues that should be addressed and encourages further discussion about the vision of the world we aspire to.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I extend my gratitude to both Luca and Michio for providing their thoughtful comments and for their hard work as researchers. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you live in a village which is threatened with rising sea levels. If you don’t do anything, your home is going to be flooded. You could pool your resources together with other villagers and build a large dam around the entire village to ensure that everyone’s property is safe. Or, if you have enough resources yourself, you could build a smaller dam around your own house, protecting your property — and leaving everyone else to either do the same or try and co-operate without you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Human societies constantly face similar choices between public and private solutions to pressing issues: think about the provision of healthcare or education, for instance. But only some people can afford to build a dam around their own house, or send their child to a private school. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18896-6&quot;&gt;new study in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;suggests that when group members are able to be self-reliant in this way, the provision of public goods suffers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-40629&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jörg Gross and colleagues at Leiden University recruited 200 participants, who were divided into 50 groups of four to play an economic game. Across a series of rounds, each participant chose how many of their personal “resource points” to invest in both a public and private fund. If the four participants collectively put enough points into the public fund to reach a certain threshold, then they would each be able to keep any of their remaining uninvested points, which could later be converted into real cash (this is like the villagers coming together to invest enough to successfully create a large dam, write the authors).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the group failed to invest enough to meet the public threshold, then they wouldn’t be protected as a group. But if an individual had put enough points into their &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt; fund, they would still be able to keep their uninvested points (in other words, they had invested enough to complete their own private “dam”). If neither threshold was met, then that person would lose all their uninvested points for the round.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers tweaked a few rules between groups and across the course of the game. In half of the groups, participants each had 90 points at their disposal every round. But in the other half, points were distributed unequally: two participants were given 120 points and two were given just 60. And while the threshold for the public solution was always set at 180 points, the cost of the &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt; one varied between 45 to 75 points, and in some rounds was not even an option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that when a private solution wasn’t available, the participants worked together, and on nearly 80% of trials successfully invested the 180 points needed for the public solution. This was true whether resources were distributed equally or unequally within the group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Things changed when there was the possibility of creating a private solution. The cheaper the private solution, the more likely participants were to invest in it, and the less likely groups were to successfully invest in the public alternative. In groups in which resources were distributed unequally, this left the two poorer participants in a tricky place. Remember, these participants had just 60 points each, so were either forced to rely on contributions from the wealthier participants to meet the 180 point threshold for the public solution, or had to spend almost all of their points on the private option (in the rounds where they could afford it). The two wealthier participants, on the other hand, could be much more self-reliant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the wealthier participants did indeed co-operate with their poorer counterparts to create a public solution. But often they made no contributions to public funds at all, particularly when the private solution was cheap. And overall they dedicated a smaller proportion of their resources to the public fund than did the poorer participants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This all had the knock-on effect of increasing the “wealth gap” between participants. As private options got cheaper, the wealthier, self-reliant participants were able to save more uninvested points to convert into cash. But at the same time, the poorer participants ended up saving &lt;em&gt;fewer &lt;/em&gt;uninvested points, presumably because they could no longer depend on there being a public option, and so were forced to spend most of their points on the private solution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study shows that groups can co-operate well when they need to, write the authors. But as people amass wealth and are able to be more self-reliant, they become less dependent on the group, which undermines that cooperation. “With increased self-reliance, groups increasingly fail to efficiently create public goods which amplifies wealth inequalities [and] undermines social cohesion,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, a lab-based economic game doesn’t reflect all the nuances of how public and private services work in the real world. Fortunately, people have no choice but to contribute to many public services — healthcare, schools, and so on — through their taxes, even if they opt to use private alternatives themselves. Still, the study lays bare a friction that clearly exists in society— even if the results are not entirely surprising.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18896-6&quot;&gt;Self-reliance crowds out group cooperation and increases wealth inequality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The auditory cortex is found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/temporal-lobe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;temporal lobe&lt;/a&gt;. Most of it is hidden from view, buried deep within a fissure called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/lateral-sulcus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lateral sulcus&lt;/a&gt;. Some auditory cortex is visible on the external surface the brain, however, as it extends to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gyrus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gyrus&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/superior-temporal-gyrus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;superior temporal gyrus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The auditory cortex can be subdivided into multiple regions, although there is still some question about the most appropriate way to create those subdivisions in the human brain. There is general agreement, however, that the auditory cortex consists of a primary area—which is often referred to as the &lt;em&gt;core&lt;/em&gt; region—as well as multiple non-primary areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The primary auditory cortex in humans is hidden within the lateral sulcus on a collection of gyri known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/heschls-gyri&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Heschl’s gyri&lt;/a&gt; (aka the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/transverse-temporal-gyri&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transverse temporal gyri&lt;/a&gt;). The precise location of the primary region in humans is variable, however, as is the arrangement of Heschl’s gyri (some people have one of these gyri, while others have two or three). For example, in some individuals the primary auditory cortex seems to occupy one Heschl’s gyrus, while in others it may extend past that gyrus into a neighboring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/sulcus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sulcus&lt;/a&gt; (or beyond).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The region adjacent to the core is often referred to as the &lt;em&gt;belt&lt;/em&gt; region, and surrounding that is an area often called the &lt;em&gt;parabelt &lt;/em&gt;region. These neighboring areas are mostly buried within the lateral sulcus as well, but may extend out to the superior temporal gyrus. The demarcations of the auditory cortex in general, however, are imprecise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-rte-preserve-empty=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the auditory cortex and what does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The auditory cortex plays a critical role in our ability to perceive sound. It is thought to be integral to our perception of the fundamental aspects of an auditory stimulus, like the pitch of the sound. But it is also important in various other aspects of sound processing, like determining where in space a sound originates from as well as identifying what might be producing the sound. The auditory cortex is also thought to be involved in higher-level auditory processing, such as recognizing aspects of sound that are specific to speech. Damage to the auditory cortex can disrupt various facets of auditory perception. For example, damage (e.g., like that caused by a stroke) might cause deficits in the ability to detect changes in pitch, localize sounds in space, or understand speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The auditory cortex primarily receives auditory information from a nucleus in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thalamus&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/medial-geniculate-nucleus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;medial geniculate nucleus&lt;/a&gt;, which is where all incoming information about hearing is sent before it is processed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebral-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cerebral cortex&lt;/a&gt;. Cells in the primary region of the auditory cortex  (and in some parts of the non-primary regions as well) are arranged so they form what is known as a &lt;em&gt;tonotopic&lt;/em&gt; map. What this means is that different areas of the auditory cortex are involved in processing different sound frequencies. (&lt;em&gt;Frequency&lt;/em&gt;, when referring to sound waves, is related to &lt;em&gt;pitch&lt;/em&gt;. High frequency sound waves lead to high-pitched sounds.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The tonotopic arrangement of the primary auditory cortex is similar to what is seen in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cochlea&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cochlea&lt;/a&gt;, where sound processing begins. Thus, it can be said that the core of the auditory cortex contains a map of the cochlea, with each point in the cochlea corresponding to a strip of cells in the auditory cortex. This type of arrangement is similar to what is seen in other sensory cortices (e.g., the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/primary-somatosensory-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;primary somatosensory cortex&lt;/a&gt; contains a map of the sensory receptors of the body).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are thought to be other patterns of functional organization of the primary auditory cortex as well, although the importance of these patterns in hearing is still poorly understood. For example, there seem to be cells (EI cells) in the auditory cortex that are activated only by stimuli coming from one ear; they are inhibited by stimuli coming from the other ear. Other cells (EE cells) are activated by information coming from both ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sensory processing in the areas surrounding the primary auditory cortex is also not well understood, but it is thought that cells in the belt and parabelt are involved in higher-level processing of complex sounds. For example, research suggests these non-primary areas of the auditory cortex may be important in recognizing species-specific vocalizations, which implies they play a role in processing speech in humans. Studies have also found the non-primary auditory regions to be involved in distinct aspects of speech perception, like detecting the beginning and end of syllables, attending to one voice while ignoring another, and processing sounds in a logical temporal order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Overall, there is still much to be learned about the fine details of auditory processing in the auditory cortex. It is clear, however, that this part of the brain plays a critical role in creating the rich sensory experience of hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot; data-rte-preserve-empty=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;References (in addition to linked text above):&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amunts K, Morosan P, Hilbig H, Zilles K.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve probably heard tales of people who are suddenly able to speak a language they didn’t know while hypnotised&lt;/strong&gt;. It goes without saying that the evidence doesn’t really support these claims — but it’s interesting that linguistics seems to attract this sort of pseudoscientific idea. At &lt;em&gt;Knowable Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowablemagazine.org/article/society/2020/fact-or-fantasy-tales-linguistic-fringe&quot;&gt;Charles Q. Choi discusses “fantastic linguistics” with historical linguist Sarah Thomason&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40617&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroscientists are increasingly recognising the influence of our internal states, such as heart rate, on our mental processes.&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers studying “interoception” hope that a better awareness of what’s going on in the body could help people manage symptoms of anxiety and other mental health conditions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sarah-garfinkel-interoception&quot;&gt;João Medeiros has more&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We tend to place too much value on the ending of an experience, which can bias our view of the experience as a whole&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/brain-can-overvalue-a-happy-ending-study&quot;&gt;reports Ali Pattillo&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Inverse&lt;/em&gt;. A recent study found that the brain encodes the overall value of an experience in the amygdala, while dislike of a disappointing ending is represented in the insula. Whether we make good choices or are unduly influenced by the ending of an experience seems to be related to the pattern of activity in those two areas.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the internet age, pornography is more accessible than ever —&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and many people have voiced concern about its harmful effects. &lt;/strong&gt;But what does the research actually say about the consequences of viewing porn? Well, like so much in psychology, the story is complicated. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/is-pornography-harmful/&quot;&gt;Zoe Cormier explores some of the nuances&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The concept of “wisdom” has a rich history in philosophy and religion — so how do you go about studying it in a scientific fashion? &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;Aeon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/how-psychological-scientists-found-the-empirical-path-to-wisdom&quot;&gt;Igor Grossmann discusses&lt;/a&gt; the attempts he and colleagues have made to establish a “scientific consensus on the psychological characteristics of wisdom and best practices for its measurement”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chimpanzees show a similar pattern of “social ageing” to humans, with the size of their social networks shrinking in older age. &lt;/strong&gt;And just like us, older chimps also seem to have stronger social bonds than their younger counterparts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/22/chimps-pare-down-their-social-circle-in-later-years-study&quot;&gt;reports Ian Sample&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local lockdown measures are ramping up across various regions of the UK,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;which once again poses challenges for connecting with our friends and families.  &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;The Conversation, &lt;/em&gt;Pascal Vrticka and Philip J. Cozzolino have some &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/how-to-stay-socially-connected-as-lockdown-returns-according-to-science-148491&quot;&gt;psychologically-informed tips&lt;/a&gt; for maintaining that feeling of connection at a distance.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have long discussed the idea that there exists a set of “dark” personality traits alongside the more benign Big Five — so much so, in fact, that one team of researchers argued that too&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/22/psychopaths-and-narcissists-have-hogged-the-limelight-now-its-time-to-explore-the-saintlier-side-of-human-personality-say-researchers-as-they-announce-a-test-of-the-light-triad-traits/&quot;&gt; much time had been spent pondering the darker side&lt;/a&gt; of human nature and that a “Light Triad” was needed to counteract it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is also debate around whether such traits — psychopathy, narcissism, Machiavellianism and sadism — are stable, or whether they can be induced. The most famous exploration of the question is almost certainly Zimbardo’s Prison Experiment, which claimed that being in a powerful position over others — in this case, acting as a prison guard — could induce sadistic behaviour in apparently non-sadistic people. The experiment’s influence is undeniable; it’s even been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XN2X72jrFk&quot;&gt;made into a film&lt;/a&gt;. But it has also been &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/03/newly-analysed-recording-challenges-zimbardos-account-of-his-infamous-prison-experiment/&quot;&gt;subject to criticism&lt;/a&gt;, casting some doubt over the extent of its findings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920305493?dgcid=rss_sd_all#s0005&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/em&gt; has joined the conversation, examining whether sadistic tendencies can be induced. The study finds that they can — particularly in people who already have some level of sadistic interest — but leaves a question mark over what that might mean for real world behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40607&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Leonie Themelidis and Jason Davies from Swansea University recruited 322 participants to take part in the study. First, participants completed the Varieties of Sadistic Tendencies measure, in which they rated themselves on various statements measuring the enjoyment of &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; sadistic or cruel behaviour (e.g. “I enjoy mocking losers to their face”) and the enjoyment of &lt;em&gt;watching&lt;/em&gt; such behaviour without taking part (e.g. “I love YouTube clips of people fighting”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, participants were split into two groups. One group saw 20 images of hands being given accidental or self-inflicted injuries (such as being cut while chopping vegetables), while a control group saw similar images without any depiction of injury. For each picture, participants completed an “empathy rating”, designed to make them think about how the person in the photograph might feel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, participants filled in another scale designed to screen sadistic personalities, rating on a scale from one to five how much they agreed with statements including “hurting people would be exciting” and “I enjoy seeing people hurt”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For their analysis, the researchers split the participants into groups depending on whether they had low, medium, or high sadism scores at the beginning of the study. Among people with low scores, those who viewed the images of harm showed very slightly higher levels of sadism at the end of the study compared to those who viewed the control images.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this effect was much more pronounced in those participants who had higher levels of sadism to begin with, supporting the hypothesis that images of harm can increase sadistic feeling. Female participants also tended to show a greater increase in sadism after viewing the pain pictures compared to males. This suggests that while to some degree sadism remains stable over time, particular states and contexts may increase it to a greater or lesser degree.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt; the images induced sadism, however, is unclear. The team makes two suggestions: that viewing pain was simply enjoyable to those with sadistic traits, or that the pictures triggered an elaborate fantasy or recall process, increasing sadistic feeling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s important not to make too strong a conclusion about what the findings might say about sadistic behaviour. For one, the follow-up measure took place immediately after viewing images of harm, so the increase in feeling experienced by the participants may not endure over time. And the team only measured sadistic feelings and tendencies, so it’s unclear whether this kind of intervention actually produces changes in people’s &lt;em&gt;behaviour&lt;/em&gt;. It’s also worth pointing out the scales included questions related to videogames (enjoying watching blood spurt in violent games) and sports (MMA matches) — things that many people enjoy harmlessly &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/06/these-violent-delights-dont-have-violent-ends-study-finds-no-link-between-violent-video-games-and-teen-aggression/&quot;&gt;with little or no impact&lt;/a&gt; on their behaviour. Future research may look into the correlation between sadistic urges and the likelihood of actually harming others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920305493?dgcid=rss_sd_all#s0005&quot;&gt;Creating evil: Can sadism be induced?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/OAWeekCULogo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Cornell's OA Week Logo of an open lock&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-703 alignright&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/OAWeekCULogo-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;On October 19, arXiv hosted an #OAWeek panel discussion about open access in the COVID-19 era with arXiv executive director Eleonora Presani; John Inglis, co-founder of bioRxiv and medRxiv and executive director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; and Sebastian Kohlmeier, CORD-19 project manager and senior manager, Semantic Scholar, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. A recap of the event and a video are available below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2020/10/panel-offers-look-open-access-covid-19-era&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recap from the Cornell Chronicle, by Melanie Lefkowitz:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__items&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;field__item&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleonora Presani’s first day as executive director of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt; was March 16, 2020 – the same day much of New York state went into lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she was new to arXiv, the free and open scientific research database maintained and operated by Cornell, she realized immediately that some things would have to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Basically out of nowhere, we started to see more than 100 [coronavirus-related] papers per week,” Presani said during an Oct. 19 panel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHfuvUxmHx4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;“Rapid Response: How arXiv and Other Open-Access Resources Are Adapting to Research Community Needs During the Pandemic.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had to do something about it,” she said, “to make sure we could process them at the same service level we provide for our other papers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission of arXiv is to make scholarly research that has not yet been published freely available to researchers around the world. When COVID-19 struck, this mission became even more urgent, as scientists raced to learn more about the coronavirus and develop ways to control the pandemic. But it also highlighted the challenges faced by preprint servers, including arXiv, bioRxiv and medRxiv, in providing easy access to a huge volume of research that has not yet been peer-reviewed while minimizing the spread of potential misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_749&quot; style=&quot;width: 270px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHfuvUxmHx4&amp;amp;t&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image of arXiv Video Screenshot&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-749 size-full&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-22-at-9.49.53-AM.png&quot; width=&quot;270&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;To watch the panel discussion in its entirety, view it here.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With nearly 1.8 million articles in its collection, arXiv relies on a team of 185 volunteer moderators, supported by a small team of staff, to screen submitted papers. But since the majority of its content is in the fields of physics, mathematics and computer science, the organization needed to quickly escalate its expertise in COVID-related research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to creating a new searchable category for coronavirus articles, arXiv hired a Cornell postdoctoral researcher in biomedicine to help screen these articles for potentially misleading content. arXiv also has partnered with other organizations compiling open-access research, in order to make these articles more easily accessible and to speed the pace of discovery worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At bioRxiv and medRxiv – which saw huge spikes in submissions as COVID-19 spread – moderators soon realized they needed enhanced measures to combat the risk of harmful misinformation. When a paper posted in January claiming that inserts in coronavirus’ spike protein resembled protein sequences from HIV, technical issues with the paper provoked a storm of criticism that led to its withdrawal, said John Inglis, co-founder of bioRxiv and medRxiv, during the panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But we also noticed during that weekend that the paper had been picked up by conspiracy-oriented websites who were discussing the possibility that the virus had been human-engineered,” Inglis said. “We decided to put up an additional caveat about the use of preprints – a large yellow banner that reminded readers that these were preprints and, among other things, they should not be reported in the U.S. media as established information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sites, hosted by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, also put in place additional screening practices, including two-step scrutiny of every paper. The screeners are looking for issues such as plagiarism and assertions that could harm the public if they turn out to be wrong, Inglis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Part of this was an awareness of the fact that in all the furor about hydroxychloroquine, for example, the run on the drug was such that patients who really needed hydroxychloroquine were denied access to it,” he said. “We were very conscious of not wanting to add to that problem, or create another similar problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papers from arXiv, bioRxiv and medRxiv are among those included in CORD-19 (COVID-19 Open Research Dataset), a new dataset made available to leverage artificial intelligence to make a vast trove of coronavirus-related research more easily searchable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to take all the research about COVID-19 and coronavirus, going back all the way to the 1960s and 1970s when initial research about coronavirus started getting published, and make that available in a machine readable format,” said panelist Sebastian Kohlmeier, CORD-19 project manager and senior manager at Semantic Scholar, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, which created CORD-19 in partnership with other research groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When CORD-19 started in March, it contained 29,000 papers. It now has more than 280,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been absolutely incredible,” Kohlmeier said. “And one of the great driving forces behind making all the content available was a lot of the scientific publishers and preprint servers banded together to make COVID-19-related research open access, which was a very important component to making this research available to scientists who wanted to analyze the entire universe of coronavirus-related research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/21/people-from-japan-may-be-less-prone-than-americans-to-some-of-the-harmful-health-related-effects-of-negative-emotions/"/>

		<updated>2020-10-21T15:21:54+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s your view on feelings of sadness, nervousness or hopelessness? Are they harmful emotions that we should strive to avoid feeling — an opinion that is widely held in the West? Or is natural, even helpful, to feel them from time to time — a perspective commonly found in Japan?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have found that cultural attitudes to our emotions affect our health. In Japan, for example, greater reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/09/22/cross-cultural-correction-for-people-in-japan-happiness-isnt-associated-with-better-health/&quot;&gt;happiness isn’t associated with better health&lt;/a&gt;, in contrast to findings from the US. Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/08/there-are-some-intriguing-differences-between-the-usa-and-japan-in-how-emotions-influence-health/&quot;&gt;regular experience of high-energy, high-arousal states is associated with better health in the US, but not Japan&lt;/a&gt;, where calm, quiet states are highly valued. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-21761-001&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt; reveals that our attitudes to negative emotions, such as sadness and hopelessness, matter, too. Previous studies have linked experience of these emotions to increased inflammation and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and even death among Americans, but not Japanese people. So Jiyoung Park at the University of Texas at Dallas and her colleagues set out to explore whether differences in stress might explain this. If, in contrast to Japanese people, Americans view the experience of negative emotions as a failure of self-control, and feel stress as a result, this could explain the links between these kinds of emotions and poorer health. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-40593&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The team analysed detailed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.midus.wisc.edu&quot;&gt;data collected on 761 Americans&lt;/a&gt; of European descent and &lt;a href=&quot;http://midus.wisc.edu/midja/index.php&quot;&gt;328 Japanese adults&lt;/a&gt;, with a mean age of about 60. As part of much bigger studies, these participants had all completed surveys to assess negative emotions (how often, and how severely, they felt them) and personality. They had also given a series of saliva samples, which had been analysed for levels of the stress hormone cortisol, and blood samples, which had been checked for certain markers of inflammation as well as cholesterol levels (which can indicate risk for cardiovascular disease). Their blood pressure had also been checked. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Healthy people show a big spike in cortisol shortly after waking, then a gradual decline in levels of this hormone during the day. Regular stress alters this pattern, blunting that early spike and making the decline less steep — a profile known to be associated with poorer health. When the team analysed the data, they found that experience of negative emotions was indeed associated with a flattening of the daily cortisol slope among the Americans, but not among the Japanese participants. (The team took all kinds of other factors into account when performing the analysis, including personality traits known to influence the reporting of negative emotions, gender, age, sleep patterns and more.) This was the case even though the Japanese participants in fact reported more negative emotions than the Americans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Park and her colleagues also found that for the Americans, but not the Japanese participants, experience of negative emotions was associated with both more inflammation and higher cardiovascular risk indicators. Their analysis led them to conclude that this was due to the flattening of the cortisol slope among only the Americans. “These findings suggest that cultural differences in how emotions are construed may make the experience of negative affect more or less stressful and differentially consequential for health,” the team writes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Japanese participants appeared to be “buffered against some of the harmful health consequences of negative affect because of their view of negative affect as a fluctuating, momentary part of a natural cycle of both the self and external events, and thus not threatening or stressful.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the researchers themselves note, there are, however, a few reasons to be cautious about drawing very strong conclusions from this data. The links that they report are all correlational, and longitudinal studies will be needed to look at variations in negative emotion, cortisol profile and health over time. Also, it’s possible that something other than differences in attitudes to negative emotion — differences in emotion regulation abilities, perhaps — are behind the different findings for Americans versus Japanese people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the research does add to a growing body of evidence that our &lt;em&gt;attitudes&lt;/em&gt; to our emotions are key to understanding how they affect our long-term health. It could be tricky to change the view, widespread in the West, of negative emotions as being undesirable, even dangerous. But this work, in the context of other recent supporting studies, certainly suggests that it is worth trying to do this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-21761-001&quot;&gt;Feeling bad is not always unhealthy: Culture moderates the link between negative affect and diurnal cortisol profiles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/people-3755342_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact tracing for disease control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syphilis and gonorrhea incidence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2019/2018-STD-surveillance-report.html&quot;&gt;have increased enormously&lt;/a&gt; in recent decades, necessitating innovative approaches. The rising prevalence of syphilis and gonorrhea, together with the increase in prevalence of resistant gonorrhea, makes contact tracing an important tool for disease control. In connection with the opioid epidemic, syphilis is now common in rural areas. However, people infected with stigmatized diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea may be reluctant to reveal all of their sexual contacts. Reasons for not revealing all contacts may include internalized stigma, cognitive dissonance, or beliefs that certain types of sexual contacts do not “count.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking for friends might identify more sexually transmitted infection (STI) cases because friends may participate within the same sexual network, or some friends might be non-romantic sexual partners. One survey even found 77% of Grindr users report looking for friendship, more than the percentage seeking dating (67%), one-on-one sex (62%), or group sex (17%).&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/feed/#_edn1&quot; name=&quot;_ednref1&quot;&gt;[i]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09589-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who were diagnosed with syphilis and gonorrhea in Baltimore City STI clinics were asked to name the most important people in their lives, with questions such as whom they eat meals with, who would take them to medical appointments, who would go to the store for them, or lend them $25. After patients named their friends and social contacts, they were asked to name their sexual contacts. Both social and sexual contacts were invited to the STI clinic for testing, and to name their own social and sexual contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this information for patients whose contacts visited the STI clinic, we created a network showing the friendship and sexual contacts and the STI test results.  We identified new cases of both syphilis and gonorrhea within each network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12132&quot; style=&quot;width: 307px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12132 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/Figure-1-297x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;297&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;New cases of syphilis&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Figure 1, the network shows new cases of syphilis identified by asking for social contacts in the large red squares.The small squares are males, and circles are females. Shapes colored red are the participants who tested positive for syphilis. The green arrows are social network connections and the black are sexual network connections. Biological strain analysis for the organism that causes syphilis (&lt;em&gt;T. pallidum&lt;/em&gt;) found that the disease strains matched across connected individuals, suggesting that individuals were connected within the same sexual network, although not necessarily directly: the friends may have had sex together or have a sex partner in common that does not appear in the graph. It’s remarkable here that for many pairs where both were infected with syphilis (syphilis-concordant dyads, for short), no sexual partners appear in the graph, and in a few cases both are male.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12133&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12133&quot; height=&quot;297&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/Figure-2-300x297.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;New cases of gonorrhea&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did the same for gonorrhea.  As before, new cases of gonorrhea identified by asking for social contacts are the large red squares. The small squares are males, and circles are females. Shapes colored red are the participants who tested positive for gonorrhea. The green arrows are social network connections and the black are sexual network connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additional cases of syphilis and gonorrhea identified by asking friendship ties suggest that they under-reported their sexual contacts. These friendship ties may actually be sexual ties that were not reported as sexual; many of these ties were same-sex, and same-sex ties were stigmatized in this community, especially at the time that the data were collected (2001-05). Alternatively, these friendship ties may represent participation in the same sexual networks, such as engaging in a sexual relationship with the same person or people, who were not observed in the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning from COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given existing strains on public health resources, public health policy must be creative. Traditionally, contact tracing is done by Disease Intervention Specialists. However, the 2008 recession resulted in large cuts to public health agencies that were never reversed. The Disease Intervention Specialists currently do not have enough resources even to contact all sexual contacts of index cases of syphilis and gonorrhea, so they prioritize vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women. Public health agencies simply do not have resources to contact the friends of index cases, and index cases may not cooperate anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, large technology companies have created privacy-preserving innovations in SARS-coronavirus-2 contact tracing &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid19.apple.com/contacttracing&quot;&gt;protocols&lt;/a&gt; that have been deployed in state health department contact tracing apps. These contact tracing protocols identify nearby phones using Bluetooth and approximate the distance and duration. Public health authorities create COVID-19 contact tracing apps using these protocols that can specify distance and time duration for potential coronavirus contacts. These protocols or health department apps could be extended to contact tracing for other diseases. Changing the parameters for distance and duration on public health contact tracing apps could identify potential sexual contacts, allowing these apps to be used for STI contact tracing. The transition to these COVID-19 contact tracing apps has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/why-contact-tracing-apps-not-slowed-covid-us/&quot;&gt;bumpy&lt;/a&gt;, with technological limitations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2020/07/how-to-get-people-to-actually-use-contact-tracing-apps&quot;&gt;low uptake&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://devops.com/more-than-half-of-americans-willing-to-participate-in-contact-tracing-but-have-major-privacy-concerns/&quot;&gt;lack of public trust&lt;/a&gt;, especially in government. The Bluetooth distance detection doesn’t do well &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/devices/contact-tracing-apps-struggle-to-be-both-effective-and-private&quot;&gt;near shiny surfaces or in public transit buses or trains&lt;/a&gt;, and while that’s a large problem for COVID-19 contact tracing, it’s not a problem for STIs. As with many US problems, low public trust in government is the limiting factor for contact tracing, whether traditional or by app.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a non-profit, mission-driven organization PLOS abides by our commitment to transparency. We &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/financial-overview/&quot;&gt;openly share&lt;/a&gt; information and context about our finances, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot;&gt;target revenue amounts&lt;/a&gt; in some of our emerging business models. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/price-and-service-transparency-frameworks/&quot;&gt;Plan S Price &amp;amp; Service Transparency Framework&lt;/a&gt; provided us — and other publishers — a clear, uniform structure to share information about the services we perform and a percentage breakdown of how these are covered by the prices we charge. Many of our mission-driven publishing activities go well beyond peer review and production services. We provide commentary on some of these services, including how the varied editorial setups of our journals contribute to different percentage price breakdowns per title. We encourage other publishers to be transparent and openly share their data via such frameworks. And, we remain confident in showcasing how our prices cover our reasonable costs for a high level of service, with some margin for reinvestment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Post&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since our founding in 2001, PLOS has maintained a firm commitment to transparency. Transparency informs our work within communities. It drives our approach to open science practices &amp;amp; policies. And it underpins our willingness to share financial data. Here are three examples of our commitment in action:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every year we provide financial transparency via the publication and contextualization of our IRS filings (&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/financial-overview/&quot;&gt;2018 financial overview available here; &lt;/a&gt;our 2019 overview will be available in November)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We participate in broader efforts within the publishing community to encourage greater understanding around pricing and the costs of Open Access publishing (see immediately below for the Plan S example)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our new collective action business model for &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology — &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot;&gt;Community Action Publishing&lt;/a&gt; — openly shares how much revenue is required for PLOS to run these specific journals. We will redistribute revenues beyond the target back to community members&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, we are especially grateful to cOAlition S for spurring the scholarly publishing community, broadly, to engage with transparency via its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/price-and-service-transparency-frameworks/&quot;&gt;Plan S Price &amp;amp; Service Transparency Framework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Response to Plan S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In early 2020, PLOS (together with nine other publishers&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.informationpower.co.uk/launch-of-the-plan-s-price-transparency-framework/&quot;&gt;piloted &lt;/a&gt;one of the two approved pricing transparency frameworks for cOAlition S. We are now &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16_3Eoxp3_C_xwontOJvLah45YC7Wgg032pGRsa2G_14/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;sharing the figures PLOS provided&lt;/a&gt; as part of this initiative to provide context to our own pricing and to further promote this kind of transparency broadly within the community. We encourage other publishers to be transparent and openly share their data as well. (Please see the post on price transparency by our friends at &lt;strong&gt;F1000 Research&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.f1000.com/2020/08/19/price-transparency-on-f1000research/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before diving into discussion of figures, we want to restate two underlying principles.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS does not charge for any activity for the sole purpose of profit. We do not seek or need revenue surplus for return to shareholders, but rather to support and reinvest in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/&quot;&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our organizational activities are developed to meet the needs of researchers, our prices cover our reasonable costs for our high level of service plus some margin for reinvestment, and our drives for efficiency are to enable as good an author experience as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Plan S Price &amp;amp; Service Transparency framework invited publishers to divide Article Processing Charge, per journal, into seven categories of activity&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journal and community development&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;efforts&lt;/strong&gt;, including commissioning content, researching editorial board members, and scope development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submission to desk reject or acceptance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peer review management &lt;/strong&gt;by staff/remunerated people, including management of submissions that are ultimately rejected&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceptance to publication&lt;/strong&gt;, including typesetting, conversation, and production tasks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services after publication&lt;/strong&gt;, including ethics checks and queries, usage statistics, long-term preservation and access monitoring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales &amp;amp; marketing&lt;/strong&gt; to customers or of articles, including marketing campaigns&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author and customer support,&lt;/strong&gt; including queries about licensing, citations, and author system troubleshooting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS’ pricing breakdown (which is only one element of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16_3Eoxp3_C_xwontOJvLah45YC7Wgg032pGRsa2G_14/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;data captured in the spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;) for 2019 is presented in the table below.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-table&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;APC price&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,350&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,350&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,350&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,350&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$3,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$3,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1,595&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price for journal and community development&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;18%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price from submission to desk reject or accept&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;25%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;27%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;21%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price for peer review management&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;21%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;23%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price for services from acceptance to publication&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;22%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;21%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;21%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;21%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price for services after publication&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price for sales &amp;amp; marketing to customers or of articles&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;% of price for author and customer support&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The above is a relatively good way of illustrating the breadth of activities that occur at PLOS, and which our income supports. However, like any framework or metric, it strips away some of the detail and nuance so we wanted to provide some overarching commentary and highlight a few observations.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Varied Editorial structures drive varied price allocation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently, PLOS has two types of editorial setup across our seven journals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; are supported by senior &lt;strong&gt;in-house&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;editorial teams&lt;/strong&gt; (including Editors-in-Chief, an Executive Editor, Senior Editors, and Associate Editors) working in conjunction with external editorial boards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt; each have &lt;strong&gt;external &lt;/strong&gt;Editors-in-Chief and Associate Editors (who are full time members of the research, medical, health, and/or academic communities).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The in-house editorial teams (a.k.a. Staff Editors) comprise salaried PLOS employees and are editorially independent. We see this combined expertise of dedicated Staff Editors and leading scientists in the field as an important aspect of the publication process for these titles. Our Staff Editors work to guide researchers through submission and peer review. They also partner with our external Academic Editors, experts in the field, to provide guidance. This unique editorial model ensures expertise, fairness and efficiency for each manuscript. This internal and external resourcing structure is reflected in the greater price share for activities related to “initial triage” and “peer review management” for these particular titles. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond editorial and production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 43% – 61% of our journals’ price covers the editorial/production work of receiving submissions, coordinating their peer review, and production and online publication of accepted articles. The remainder of the price covers the broader and deeper work of services before and after the publication process, including marketing, author support, and ethics checks, among other things — each of which is critically important. As examples:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS has a highly regarded &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/staff-editors#loc-publication-ethics&quot;&gt;publishing ethics team&lt;/a&gt; that handles all  ethical and scientific concerns involving submissions and published articles. It also works to raise awareness of publication ethics standards, develops policies and processes to address integrity issues (at scale) prior to publication, and participates in broader discussions about publication ethics policies and practices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS engages closely with research communities (e.g. by attending/organizing conferences/events/workshops, these days mostly online) to ensure the journals and their policies truly reflect the research interests and values of these fields and communities. We operate in both global and local contexts, therefore it is ever more important to ensure we reflect the values of the diverse communities of researchers whom we publish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS has a dedicated, proactive &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/media/&quot;&gt;media team&lt;/a&gt; that collaborates with authors, institutions, science media centers and journalists to communicate research to both scientists and society. Consequently, articles published in our journals receive great attention in the media. The team also develops policies and participates in industry conversations about best practices (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/05/preprints-and-the-media-a-change-to-how-plos-handles-press-for-papers-previously-posted-as-preprints/&quot;&gt;preprints and the media&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS’ Outreach team promotes articles, invites submissions, promotes initiatives like calls for papers, and has also created widely used and well-regarded resources such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-reviewers/&quot;&gt;Peer Review Center&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/writing-center/&quot;&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS pilots, develops, and leads the way in &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/&quot;&gt;Open Science practices&lt;/a&gt;, from creating new software to be able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/&quot;&gt;publish peer review histories at scale&lt;/a&gt;, to patiently cultivating trust in science via a rigorous approach to &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/transparency-and-trust-peer-review-week-2020/&quot;&gt;preprints and preprint commenting&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLOS is &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/&quot;&gt;constantly working&lt;/a&gt; to make Open Access easier, more efficient, and fair for researchers from all demographics, geographies, and disciplines. This is both via &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot;&gt;new business model&lt;/a&gt; development, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Open-Access-RFI-Comments-Reduced-5.pdf&quot;&gt;policy engagement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We hope the full data and above commentary can give you some new insights. At PLOS we are proud of what we do. It is our privilege to devote our time and energy towards such crucial matters as increasing trust in science. We will always do this in partnership with the research community. And, perhaps, there has never been a more important time to be doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;It’s the start of Open Access Week 2020 and this year’s theme focuses on “Open with Purpose” with equity and inclusivity as the focal point for the third consecutive year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are we still talking about this?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this time, the need for international collaboration and access without restrictions is acutely apparent with COVID-19 pausing regular activities, such as conferences, libraries and other in person events. Building equity and inclusivity will create a stronger environment for scientists to ask questions or see problems from a different perspective. It’s also integral for organizations to reflect on what they can do to help researchers from every background get their research to the communities that need it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking to an inclusive future&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;OA helps break down many of the barriers researchers face by sharing their findings to a vast readership. Yet, a number of hurdles still stand between them and the final article. At PLOS, we support researchers at every stage of their career, research and discipline. Open Science further increases transparency and visibility of their work so that all researchers can more easily be recognized for their contributions. With a host of journals and a variety of article types and early sharing methods such as preprints and preregistered reports — researchers will have the opportunity to showcase the full breadth of their findings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We recognize that as an organization we can do much more to assist those in the scientific community that experience challenges due to their gender, race, culture and more. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/07/our-commitment-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/&quot;&gt;blog post by Editorial Director Joerg Heber&lt;/a&gt;, he outlines our support for a diverse and inclusive community and the areas we’ll continue to improve on to recognize and minimize bias, further diversify our leadership and contributors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be counted for your work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OA provides the community with the accessibility to your research to see, cite, and share it. Your research and contributions in the community are vital to scientific advancements. Be proud, in whatever stage of your career, of what you’ve achieved and get the recognition for your contributions, be that through your ORCID iD or citations. The OA community is increasingly adapting to the needs of ECRs. Transparency and early sharing practices for every stage of the research process are becoming increasingly common to support researchers in demonstrating their contributions, beyond just publications. Be the first to report your findings with &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/&quot;&gt;preprints&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/&quot;&gt;preregistration&lt;/a&gt;, just two ways in which you can highlight your progress early when you’re applying for funding and new positions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS is always searching for new ways we can make publishing and acknowledging your work easier. Whether that means building a more inclusive framework to ensure credit is shared equitably among contributors, or supporting researchers in making their work more visible.  In a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/implementing-name-changes-for-published-transgender-authors/&quot;&gt;policy announced last week&lt;/a&gt;, we’re providing better support to transgender authors with live articles published under names that do not reflect their identity. Our staff will be happy to help update your records and help you keep your previous credits. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote is-style-default&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publishing an academic study is an achievement for researchers to be proud of, and it is important that the name on the paper reflects who the authors are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;— &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/implementing-name-changes-for-published-transgender-authors/&quot;&gt;Implementing name changes for published transgender authors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Access is more important than ever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a time where COVID-19 proves to be a challenging obstacle with restrictions to labs and libraries, it is integral that we’re inclusive of the many groups in the scientific community — researchers around the world need access to content anywhere, anytime. OA is the key to providing fast, public access to research with no restrictions or embargoes. The global benefit of open research is powerful and will help maintain the continuation of scientific advancements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the heart of inclusivity, cost plays a major role in separating researchers from the Open Access journals they would like to publish in. Over this year we’ve made great strides in partnering with institutions and consortia to bridge the gap between cost for prospective PLOS authors. And we’re continuing to experiment with new models that get closer to a truly open to read, open to publish ideal, equitably distributing the costs of publishing so that the burden of payment doesn’t fall on authors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps for a fair and diverse future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will continue to improve our processes and endeavour to be advocates for equity and inclusivity in OA and the broader academic community. Beyond 2020, scholarly communication will need to continue the work around creating inclusive environments for researchers by examining the struggles of systemic inequities, acknowledge bias by working with editors and reviewers, and ultimately take action to create a more accessible future for all. More updates to come! &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authors: Ruth Schmidt is an Associate Professor at IIT’s Institute of Design and Anna Hatch is the program director for&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;DORA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. PLOS supports DORA financially via organizational membership, and PLOS is represented on the steering committee of DORA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making/&quot;&gt;part one &lt;/a&gt;of our series we showed how objective comparisons are not equitable . In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making-part-ii/&quot;&gt;second part&lt;/a&gt; of this series we showed how individual data points can accidentally distract from the whole. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making-part-iii/&quot;&gt;In part 3&lt;/a&gt; we explored how we gauge value by association. In our final installment we get into how &lt;strong&gt;incumbent processes and perceptions have the advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The deep legacy traditions held by many academic institutions can be powerful, contributing a sense of continuity and identity and reducing the need to continually reinvent the wheel. But when these organizational habits and norms become too normalized, and old processes and structures persist because “that’s how we’ve always done this,” they can create an unhealthy sense of insularity that excludes new ideas and people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One contributing factor to this is&lt;strong&gt; Confirmation bias&lt;/strong&gt;, which describes peoples’ tendencies to dismiss evidence that doesn’t fit their initial judgments or preconceptions, even if these presumptions are grounded in subjective experiences and limited data. Failing to gather and consider counter-evidence makes us more likely to fall into old ways of thinking, such as cherry-picking information from a CV to confirm the view we already have, or dismissing potential warning signs because a candidate has already been accepted as a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status quo bias&lt;/strong&gt;, sometimes known as “effort aversion,” reflects our tendency to take the path of least resistance unless there are strong reasons not to. This can lead to situations where people stick with recognizably flawed processes because the effort to fix them or adopt new ones is perceived as too much effort. For example, the continued use of citations to indicate research quality is driven in part by the fact that it’s perceived as familiar and easier, not necessarily better, than using alternate indicators of real-world impact. For academic institutions — never known as stealthy and agile entities even in the best of times — this can cause significant paralysis, keeping demonstrably subpar structures in place long past their usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can institutions do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it easy.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes the biggest barriers to adopting new behaviors are actually smaller than one might expect, such as not knowing where to start or a lack of clarity about the value of doing things differently. Making the benefits of new behaviors concrete, salient, and simple to grasp makes both starting and follow-through easier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question what you “know.”&lt;/strong&gt; Sticking with old assumptions tends to reward those with more traditional backgrounds, which comes at the expense of attracting new or more diverse talent. Productively pushing back on assumptions — even assigning the role of playing devil’s advocate during deliberations — can force all involved to be crisper and more defined about what qualities matter, and why.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broaden notions of success.&lt;/strong&gt; New processes can only go so far if definitions for success (and who’s invited to the table) aren’t also revisited. Setting, publicizing, and adhering to goals that look beyond traditional norms or value alternate experiences can broaden the diversity of individuals under consideration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Incumbent systems, processes, and structures are inherently advantaged, partly due to familiarity and partly because our tendency toward effort aversion tells us it’s almost always easier to stick with the old, however flawed, than introduce something new. This is especially true when those in positions of seniority have benefited from these legacy systems as their careers have progressed, and when in many cases entire academic careers spent at an individual institution may mean limited insight into even &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to do things differently. But the need to introduce more equitable decision-making into RPT decisions to increase the presence of minoritized candidates, researchers, and faculty is very real, and will not happen without a combination of serious intent and structural support. Without active intervention, one model of current post-doc to faculty transitions has indicated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/21393&quot;&gt;faculty diversity will not otherwise significantly increase until 2080&lt;/a&gt;. This is too little, too late.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;em&gt;To encourage the adoption of more equitable hiring, and RPT processes, the authors are collaborating on a series of tools for DORA to assist institutions in experimenting with new processes, indicators, and principles. Available &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/resources/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Four million monthly users. 1.7 million articles. More than one billion downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers are clear: arXiv is a critical resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what these numbers don’t reveal? The impact arXiv has had on individual people across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excitement of a grad student posting their first article. The junior faculty member who just earned tenure, thanks to research originally shared on arXiv. The productive researcher whose library cannot afford to subscribe to all the right journals. The weekly research group meeting to discuss the most recent arXiv papers. The interdisciplinary collaboration sparked by an arXiv submission. The machine learning enthusiast who tinkers with the arXiv dataset, future discoveries yet unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“arXiv is like air.”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the words of an arXiv-er. In other words, arXiv is free, totally necessary, and easy to take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But arXiv is not free to produce, which is why we’re asking you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1717/alumni/event.aspx?sid=1717&amp;amp;gid=2&amp;amp;pgid=22315&amp;amp;cid=35778&amp;amp;dids=276&amp;amp;bledit=1&amp;amp;sort=1&quot;&gt;join arXiv’s community of supporters with a donation&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;strong&gt;International Open Access Week&lt;/strong&gt;, from October 19th through the 23rd. We urge you to consider recurring payments in any amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 80% of arXiv’s operating budget comes from voluntary contributions from the Simons Foundation, member institutions, and &lt;strong&gt;individuals like you&lt;/strong&gt;. Your contribution will help ensure that arXiv remains &lt;strong&gt;a non-commercial, community resource.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1717/alumni/event.aspx?sid=1717&amp;amp;gid=2&amp;amp;pgid=22315&amp;amp;cid=35778&amp;amp;dids=276&amp;amp;bledit=1&amp;amp;sort=1?source=blog&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Donate Button&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-738&quot; height=&quot;58&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Donate-Button.png&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/core-logo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;CORE logo&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-719 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;127&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/core-logo-300x127.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt; readers now have a faster way to find articles relevant to their interests. From an article abstract page, readers can simply activate the CORE Recommender to find additional open access research on similar topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Recommender, part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXivLabs&lt;/a&gt; toolset, was developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;CORE&lt;/a&gt;, a global aggregator of open access scientific content, which provides access to millions of full texts. CORE’s mission is to aggregate all open access research outputs from repositories and journals worldwide and make them available to the public. In this way, CORE facilitates free unrestricted access to research for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate a list of recommended works, the tool utilizes an algorithm based on the article’s full text and metadata, including title, authors, and abstract. The suggestions come both from arXiv and other resources in the CORE collection, and as many as five articles with freely accessible full texts might be recommended. A detailed explanation and discussion of the algorithm, by CORE founder Petr Knoth and his coauthors, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00578&quot;&gt;available on arXiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These recommendations benefit readers, who will access relevant information more quickly, and authors, whose open access content will become more visible to interested readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am very excited about this partnership as arXiv and CORE are both fully embracing the same vision of openness to research for all,” said Petr Knoth, founder and head of CORE. “This partnership will further improve open access infrastructure. It will help arXiv users to discover open access research papers relevant to their work from across the whole network of open access repositories.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are happy to welcome CORE to the arXivLabs family,” said arXiv executive director Eleonora Presani, “and we believe the Recommender will help arXiv users discover the content most relevant to their research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv values openness, community, and the privacy of user data and only works with partners that abide by the same principles. Like all third party collaborators, CORE will only have access to minimal and anonymized data about arXiv users, and only for the purpose of ensuring the correct functioning of the arXivLabs features. Any other use not included in a written consent from arXiv is strictly prohibited. Upon user request this data, and another other data connected to the user can be permanently deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The following press release was issued on Wednesday, October 14th at 12:01 Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — Jisc, the digital solutions provider for education and research in the UK, and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced two 3-year Open Access (OA) agreements that allow researchers to publish in PLOS journals without incurring article processing charges (APC). This is the first time that a large university consortium has provided collective agreements as an alternative to APCs at this scale. Jisc and PLOS will also collaborate on future data, metrics, and tools for institutions to evaluate OA publishing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Jisc has always been a priority partner, given its high profile, its large existing institutional account base with PLOS, and leadership role in the library community,” said Sara Rouhi, director of strategic partnerships for PLOS. “It’s always exciting to partner with a forward-leaning organization whose values and priorities around Open Access and Open Science align with our own. We also look forward to sharing the fruits of this partnership with the broader community.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-18471&quot; height=&quot;138&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/Jisc-Sq-Logo-2018-RGB-for-Digital.jpg&quot; width=&quot;138&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Caren Milloy, Jisc’s director of licensing, adds: “We are pleased to have reached these pioneering agreements with PLOS, which will make it easier for researchers to publish OA and offer affordability and sustainability to institutions. These collective action agreements have the potential to help shape the future of OA funding.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the flat fee agreement, which begins on January 1, 2021, annual fixed prices will cover uncapped publishing in five PLOS journals&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; for corresponding authors affiliated with participating Jisc institutions as well as custom reporting and collaboration on future reporting standards initiatives. The PLOS Community Action Publishing agreement, facilitates uncapped publishing in PLOS’ two highly selective journals&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftn2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; through a collective action model. Both corresponding and contributing authors affiliated with participating Jisc institutions are eligible. The model itself is predicated on cost recovery, capped margins, and redistributing revenues above target back to community members.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These agreements empower authors who want to participate in Open Access publishing, and support a diverse scholarly communication ecosystem for researchers and readers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; PLOS journals include &lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Pathogens, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Py94lQGyxhA/"/>

		<updated>2020-10-13T14:53:26+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Digital Science and PLOS are pleased to announce an agreement which will provide PLOS, the leading Open Access (OA) publisher with access to Dimensions on BigQuery. Dimensions is a comprehensive database that covers the full research and innovation lifecycle. BigQuery, Google Cloud’s serverless and secure multi-cloud data warehouse, enables PLOS to analyse the full metadata of Dimensions and use it to inform strategy and decision-making across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This follows the recent Digital Science partnership with Google Cloud, which was designed to remove barriers to data access, analysis and visualization for organizations across the research and innovation ecosystem. In today’s environment, stakeholders in the research and innovation ecosystem are seeking to make better, evidence-based decisions. To do this, they need greater access to contextual information, while at the same time protecting the security of their own data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dimensions is a research information platform which has been developed to provide a comprehensive view on the research process and activities  – going beyond publications and citations. While covering 112 million publications with 1.2 billion citations, Dimensions also interlinks data from $1.8 trillion of funded grants, 583,000 clinical trials, 40 million patents, 453k policy documents and 1.5 million datasets. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS has been using Dimensions Analytics and the Dimensions API since early 2020, and is also an existing Google BigQuery user. This latest agreement therefore fits seamlessly with PLOS’s own data strategy, providing their staff Dimensions data on Google BigQuery to help shape their business development strategy, monitor trends in the OA landscape — such as providing evidence to support Open Access Transformative Agreements, and create custom dashboards and reports that can be securely accessed and shared across their organization. PLOS will now be able to combine their own internal data with Dimensions external data sources, helping create a 360° view of the research landscape.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kristen Monahan, Data &amp;amp; Insights Senior Manager, said:&lt;em&gt; – &lt;/em&gt;“PLOS already relies on Dimensions for baseline data about institutions and funding to assist in our agreement discussions and uses a combination of Dimensions and internal data for business analytics. Also having access to Dimensions data via Google BigQuery gives us tremendous freedom to analyse and integrate Dimensions data across our organization.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Christian Herzog, CEO Dimensions, said: “We’re very pleased that, through this agreement, PLOS staff will get unprecedented access to the Dimensions database. This brings them full flexibility to perform advanced analytics at industry-leading speeds and create personalized dashboards and reports. More importantly, however, it brings them greater access to the contextual information in Dimensions that supports their thoughtful approach to informed, evidence-based decision-making.”&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around 11 months ago we announced our year-long  &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/&quot;&gt;preprint commenting pilot&lt;/a&gt; to connect bioRxiv comments on preprints that are under consideration at select PLOS journals to the editors handling those articles. (The journals in the pilot are &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have one month left on this pilot, and in the interest of making the most of this, we also want to hear from YOU, the open science community. Have you ever received public feedback on a preprint? Do you comment on preprints? Privately or publicly? Do you read preprints but feel that you can’t give feedback?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you answered yes to any of the above, we want to hear from you.  Tell us your preprint story &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbrdpufuZDrmfqvWgfjk8O0Renr3p75Ii1XlftPuYHWPOYkg/viewform&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we anticipated, during this pilot the majority of eligible preprints haven’t received any public comments on the bioRxiv platform. Staff facilitating this pilot have observed that, while some preprints receive high quality feedback in the comments, most do not. Also, the timing of preprint commenting has not always lined up with the peer review process, so that preprints have received detailed feedback after an editorial decision had already been made. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pilot programs provide an opportunity to take the ongoing temperature of the community regarding innovations in scholarly communication and researcher behaviors. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/833400v1.full&quot;&gt;2019 survey reported&lt;/a&gt; that 53% of preprint posters do so in order to receive feedback. So how should we interpret this slow uptake of commenting on the bioRxiv platform?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;328&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VncPSe15Um9uJHUwXTGO6vatdLGU55Qf-3XsfVcyJ2S053HSQ_vIeMXdtPNHFDqhtN58uaGMHWQEOZmUhbF9fYEKBa0wzm_JNhCFJh1OaSf3DZrbewR4KfqVNUHe_U4cs8CpuzxQ&quot; width=&quot;624&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We could easily assume that there just isn’t a lot of interest in preprint commenting. Yet a recent flash survey of reviewers across all the PLOS journals (not just the ones in this pilot) revealed that at least 11% of those surveyed had provided public feedback on a preprint. While a few reported giving private feedback, the majority of respondents told us that they read preprints but don’t comment on them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, ASAPbio &lt;a href=&quot;https://asapbio.org/biopreprints2020-survey-initial-results&quot;&gt;recently found&lt;/a&gt; that more than 50% of researchers indicate that the opportunity for early feedback on preprints was very beneficial, suggesting that authors could benefit from preprint commenting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the early stages of this pilot we already knew (from the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/833400v1.full&quot;&gt;2019 survey above&lt;/a&gt;) that researchers have reported a preference for private feedback, and that most researchers who &lt;em&gt;have &lt;/em&gt;received feedback have received it privately via email or conversation, or, if publicly, via Twitter. Our pilot, which only covered comments left on the bioRxiv platform, had no way of noting whether any comments were actually coming to the authors via other channels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we launched this pilot we also talked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/11/why-engage-with-preprints/&quot;&gt;why we engage with preprints&lt;/a&gt;. We see preprints as an important step towards opening up peer review to more voices beyond those expressly invited by the editors. Far from being a side-step around peer review, as some detractors see them, we see preprints as a way of getting &lt;strong&gt;even more&lt;/strong&gt; eyes, and therefore reviews, on an article undergoing peer review. As our Chief Scientific Officer, Veronique Kiermer, wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/transparency-and-trust-peer-review-week-2020/&quot;&gt;post during Peer Review Week&lt;/a&gt;, preprints maximize and diversify peer review in a way that the traditional process cannot, in a way that complements that traditional process and makes it even stronger. This is all “a celebration of peer review in different forms”!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we remain committed to providing greater opportunities for research communities to participate in reviews of preprints, while promoting transparency in peer review, but we will now consider how we could refine processes around facilitating engagement with preprints during the peer review process. We believe that maximizing and diversifying the voices involved in peer review is simply a behavior we must patiently cultivate, and we will use the lessons learned from the pilot to help us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remember, please complete the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbrdpufuZDrmfqvWgfjk8O0Renr3p75Ii1XlftPuYHWPOYkg/viewform&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;! We have one month of the pilot left to go, and we would like to complement our final report with the findings from this survey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, please watch this space for more posts about preprints, peer review, and all the ways in which we’re working with the research community to improve trust in science.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;At PLOS we are committed to addressing the needs of all research communities to improve diversity, equity and inclusion. One of the concerns for some of our transgender and non-binary authors is around changes to their names and how these are reflected in the academic record. In particular, the names assigned to transgender or non-binary persons at birth can represent a stigma, and these names are sometimes referred to as deadnames. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although authors can change their name on their ORCiD profiles themselves, changes to their published academic record have been difficult to implement since, traditionally, changes are limited to correcting author or publisher errors. We believe there is no reason for this to be a barrier. Publishing an academic study is an achievement for researchers to be proud of, and it is important that the name on the paper reflects who the authors are. Therefore, across all PLOS journals we will now honor requests from transgender and non-binary authors of published papers to update their names. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The relevant papers will be “republished”, meaning that they will be fully replaced online, and that their indexing metadata (which affects how the author list appears in PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, etc.) should subsequently be updated accordingly. This replaces the author name fully, yet ensures that citation information such as the DOI for the paper remains the same. All previous citations to the paper remain valid. To maintain the author’s privacy, no notice of the name change will be attached to the replaced paper. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We strive to support our authors and address issues around equality and inclusion, and welcome any enquiries from transgender authors interested in updating names on their past publications. There is no requirement for authors to do so, this is entirely at their discretion. To initiate this process, simply email us at the relevant journal office. What matters to us is the person who authored the paper, and we want to ensure that the published academic record reflects their correct identity.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/_MRchp5tKOc/"/>
		<id>https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18440</id>
		<updated>2020-10-12T14:37:37+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authors: Ruth Schmidt is an Associate Professor at IIT’s Institute of Design and Anna Hatch is the program director for&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;DORA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. PLOS supports DORA financially via organizational membership, and PLOS is represented on the steering committee of DORA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making/&quot;&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt; of our series we showed how objective comparisons are not equitable. In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making-part-ii/&quot;&gt;second part&lt;/a&gt; of this series we showed how individual data points can accidentally distract from the whole. Now in part 3 we explore how we gauge value by association.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While we often give individual data points too much weight, we also face a related, but distinct, tendency to see patterns where they may not exist, or to apply less-than-sound mental models to define the relationships between items. This means that our interpretations of future likelihoods, personal abilities, and relative importance are often skewed, which in turn can impact how we judge risk or prioritize options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the &lt;strong&gt;Halo effect&lt;/strong&gt; also contributes to this tendency, as seen in cases where highly rated or prominent institutions and journals (and individuals associated with them) receive the benefit of the doubt based on reputation. While this associative property can feel like a useful shortcut, it can cause decision-makers to overlook or override important data that should give us pause. For example, noting that an applicant shares one’s alma mater or trained under one’s former mentor might unfairly bolster their reputation based on factors that have little to do with the quality of their own work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another classic behavioraleconomics concept known as&lt;strong&gt; Availability&lt;/strong&gt; is equally relevant. This describes our tendency to fall back on or place a higher weight on anecdotal, top-of-mind, or easily recalled data when making choices. In doing so, availability reduces our power to be fair-minded and equitable, because we end up dismissing other important evidence and missing the bigger picture. Availability can occur when individual or memorable anecdotes are prioritized in academic assessment, like overweighting a single experience or leaning too heavily on someone’s anecdotal recollection to inform a hiring decision. It can also lead to over-valuing recent data, like getting a well-known grant, instead of pursuing a fuller picture of scholarly productivity that would yield a more well-rounded decision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can institutions do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structured information gathering.&lt;/strong&gt; These tendencies are more likely to occur when there’s no formal mechanism to gather data, increasing the likelihood individual memories or perceptions will dominate judgment and decision-making. The use of structured formats, like interview protocols and narrative format CVs, can keep decision-makers focused on agreed-upon qualities rather than on the vagaries of individual interactions and reflections and also ensure greater consistency of information across candidates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Force long-term thinking.&lt;/strong&gt; Short-term thinking tends to come more naturally than planning for the future, which means that the attributes we consider important are often more oriented toward immediacy over the longer term. Explicitly articulating and considering longitudinal values and goals, in addition to short-term needs, can help decision-makers concretize the potential outcomes, both pro and con, of decisions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contextualizing narratives&lt;/strong&gt;. Traditional CVs are not known for their ability to demonstrate the big picture. Asking applicants to provide supplemental narratives that highlight and articulate their most meaningful contributions can convert commonly used shortcut characteristics for quality and productivity into more human form. This can re-center the conversation around&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03696-w&quot;&gt; research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03696-w&quot;&gt;impact&lt;/a&gt; that extends beyond citations and academic circles to include demonstrable real-world change and improved outcomes, and provide concrete definition to otherwise vague terms like “world-class” and “significant contribution.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our final installment next week, we’ll call out how incumbent processes and perceptions have the advantage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To encourage the adoption of more equitable hiring, and RPT processes, the authors are collaborating on a series of tools for DORA to assist institutions in experimenting with new processes, indicators, and principles. Available &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfdora.org/resources/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Getty images&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/Blog-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest aspects in taking care of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease is planning for future renal replacement needs, either dialysis or transplant options. The benefits of transplantation over dialysis are widely accepted and if someone is a medically cleared, they should be encouraged to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199912023412303&quot;&gt;pursue transplantation&lt;/a&gt;. Dialysis counseling and education is individualized for patients depending on their other medical conditions, support systems, and transplant candidacy.   For those patients that are cleared medically and have potential live donors, discussions about home dialysis training and permanent dialysis access are curtailed. The assumption that the time on dialysis will be short and therefore effort towards arteriovenous access creation or home dialysis training seems wasted. But is the wait time really that short?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-02080-5&quot;&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Dr. Slyvestre &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; report on 9300 incident dialysis patients listed and cleared for transplantation, and highlight the potential complications of catheter procedures or infections and associated increased risk of death during the wait time. Most striking was the median time to transplantation for both deceased donor recipients of 15 months and 9 months for those with live donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential year on dialysis therapy, even with potential donors, raises a few questions for nephrologists. Are we adequately preparing patients for that time on dialysis while they are waiting for workup and the potential delays? Should we be looking at the home dialysis options more? Are we putting patients at risk of a tunneled dialysis catheter infection that could have more significant complications such as disseminated infection requiring prolonged antibiotics or delay their surgery. The wait times also suggest perhaps a closer look at the process of workup for donors to see if there are ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajt.14732&quot;&gt;streamline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are we putting patients at risk of a tunneled dialysis catheter infection that could have more significant complications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a discussion with the patient’s transplant team to get a realistic time frame for the live donor surgery is going to be an important part of the decision making process. It will be a very different approach if a patient has a surgical date in 2 months versus a patient who has a potential donor but it is very early in the process. On the flip side, it would be important to share the information with patients so they are not getting discouraged with the wait times. Additionally, the decisions that they will make about dialysis options would be more informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This need is further amplified against the &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajt.16167&quot;&gt;backdrop of the COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; pandemic and it’s impact on transplantation. While healthcare systems around the world were overwhelmed by the influx of cases, there was a need to pause on “elective” procedures. Kidney transplantation rates fell as providers scrambled to balance the risk of immunosuppression and the risk of infection from COVID-19. The transplant evaluation process is further slowed by the inability to do in person visits for a multi-disclipinary team evaluation and delays in necessary testing for medical clearance as routine testing for things like mammograms and colonoscopy were on hold. Transplant centers are actively surveilling local rates of infections and mortality rates from COVID-19 and modifying evaluation and listing processes based on the resources available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is desire to move forward with transplantation, it needs to be done in a way to maintain the safety of donors and recipients. Nephrologists need to recognize the fluid nature of the transplantation process and help guide their patients through this process.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/28/arxivlabs-a-space-for-community-innovation/&quot;&gt;arXivLabs&lt;/a&gt; launched a new Code tab, a shortcut linking Machine Learning articles with their associated code. arXivLabs provides a conduit for collaboration that invites community participation while allowing arXiv developers to focus on core services. This Code feature was developed by&lt;a href=&quot;https://paperswithcode.com/about&quot;&gt; Papers with Code&lt;/a&gt;, a free resource for researchers and practitioners to find and follow the latest Machine Learning papers and code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a reader activates the Code tool on the arXiv abstract record page, the author’s implementation of the code will be displayed in the tab, if available, as well as links to any community implementations. This instant access allows researchers to use and build upon the work quickly and easily, increasing code accessibility and accelerating the speed of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_710&quot; style=&quot;width: 924px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-1.34.57-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot of abstract page with code tab highlighted&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-710 size-full&quot; height=&quot;782&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-1.34.57-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;924&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Under the abstract on an arXiv record page, you can now find code.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors can also directly link code to their arXiv papers directly from their arXiv user page by clicking on the PwC icon next to the paper title. From there they will be directed to&lt;a href=&quot;https://paperswithcode.com/&quot;&gt; Papers with Code&lt;/a&gt; where they can add their code. Once an official implementation is added, the official code section will show up on the arXiv abstract page. From the Papers with Code site, researchers can also explore similar methods to determine which might suit their purposes best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_712&quot; style=&quot;width: 1024px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-1.35.57-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot of arXiv user page, with links to Papers with Code next to each paper&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-712&quot; height=&quot;290&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-1.35.57-PM-1024x290.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;arXiv user page, with links to Papers with Code next to each paper&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv values openness, community, and the privacy of user data and will only work with partners that abide by the same principles. All data on Papers with Code is freely available and is licensed under&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/&quot;&gt; CC-BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;. Like all third party collaborators, Papers with Code will only have access to minimal and anonymized data about arXiv users, and only for the purpose of ensuring the correct functioning of the arXivLabs features. Any other use not included in a written consent from arXiv is strictly prohibited. Upon user request this data, and another other data connected to the user can be permanently deleted. PwC also developed&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/05/new-classifier-adds-transparency-to-arxiv-submission-process/&quot;&gt; arXiv’s new classifier tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv thrives on collaboration and encourages everyone to submit ideas for enhancing arXiv at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:nextgen@arxiv.org&quot;&gt;nextgen@arxiv.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
