 Ladies and gentlemen, we appear to have a new record. The Journal of Fundamental and Applied Sciences (JFAS) recently retracted 434 articles from three issues of their journal. Yes, 434, giving it more retractions than any other journal ever, according to our records. All of the articles, on topics ranging from “Effect of olive leaf … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2019/02/20/journal-retracts-more-than-400-papers-at-once/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Journal retracts more than 400 papers at once&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loneliness not only feels bad, experts have characterised it as &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/12/loneliness-is-a-disease-that-changes-the-brains-structure-and-function/&quot;&gt;a disease&lt;/a&gt; that increases the risk of a range of physical and psychological disorders. Some national prevalence estimates for loneliness are alarming. Although they can be as low as 4.4 per cent (in Azerbaijan), in other countries (such as Denmark) as many as 20 per cent of adults report being either moderately or severely lonely.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there’s no established way of identifying loneliness. Most diagnostic methods treat it as a one-dimensional construct: though it can vary in degrees, someone is either “lonely”, or they’re not. A new approach, outlined in &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-018-1597-8&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; published recently in &lt;i&gt;Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology&lt;/i&gt;, suggests that loneliness should in fact be divided into three sub-types, two of which are associated with poor mental health.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36467&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip Hyland at Trinity College Dublin and colleagues studied a nationally representative sample of 1,839 US adults aged between 18 and 70, all of whom had experienced at least one traumatic event in their lifetime. (This allowed the team to also look for associations between childhood or adult trauma and loneliness.) Most were married or living with a partner.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a six-item scale that measured feelings of “social loneliness” (focusing on perceptions of the &lt;i&gt;quantity&lt;/i&gt; of one’s social relationships) and “emotional loneliness” (which focused on perceptions of the &lt;i&gt;quality&lt;/i&gt; of one’s relationships). They also completed questionnaires assessing levels of childhood and adult trauma, depression and anxiety, and their psychological wellbeing.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following convention, the 17.1 per cent of participants who scored a certain amount above the average loneliness score for the sample (by more than one standard deviation)  were classified as “lonely” – a figure comparable to that found previously in many other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers also used a statistical technique to look for qualitative differences between the participants’ loneliness responses, and this revealed four distinct classes.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first class – which they called “low loneliness” – was characterised by low scores on both types of loneliness, social and emotional. Just over half the participants fell into this category. The second class – “social loneliness” – making up 8.2 per cent of the sample, comprised people low on emotional loneliness, but high on social loneliness. The third class – “emotional loneliness” – made up just over a quarter of the total sample and was characterised by the opposite pattern of high emotional loneliness but low levels of social loneliness. People in the fourth and final “social and emotional loneliness” class, accounting for 12.4 per cent of the sample, scored high for both types of loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found a clear gradient of psychological distress across the classes. People in the low loneliness class were, predictably, least distressed, followed by people in the “social loneliness” class, then the “emotional loneliness” class, and finally the “social and emotional loneliness” class. In fact, people in both these last two classes had levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety and negative psychological wellbeing that were reflective of a psychiatric disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, quality of relationships appears more important to mental health than the sheer number of them.“These results indicate that while the experience of social loneliness is associated with slight diminutions in overall mental health, relative to the low loneliness class, the experience of emotional loneliness has a substantially greater, and more negative impact on overall mental health status,” the researchers write. “The combination of social and emotional loneliness is associated with the poorest mental health status,” they note.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who belonged to the emotional loneliness class were more likely to be female, younger than average for the group, not in a relationship and to have suffered an increased number of childhood traumas. (Every childhood traumatic experience increased the odds of belonging to the emotional loneliness class by 28 per cent.) The same associations were true for the “social and emotional” loneliness class – except they were also characterised by a greater number of adult traumas.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 39.0 per cent, the total percentage of participants who fell into the two loneliness classes characterised by clinically relevant levels of psychological distress was much higher than the 17.1 per cent loneliness figure obtained using the conventional one-dimensional approach. “This finding indicates that by recognising naturally occurring subtypes of loneliness, the number of people experiencing a form… that is likely to be of clinical relevance is more than double the number identified when loneliness is conceptualised as a unidimensional construct,” the researchers note.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work suggests that in assessing loneliness, whether in an individual or at a national level, it’s important to recognise there are various subtypes. It also supports findings from some other studies that it’s the quality, not quantity, of your relationships that really matters. As the researchers conclude: “From a societal perspective, and in the interests of reducing the burden of psychological distress, efforts should be made to enhance the quality of social connections as opposed to promoting the virtues of larger social networks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00127-018-1597-8&quot;&gt;Quality not quantity: loneliness subtypes, psychological trauma, and mental health in the US adult population&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The ultimate goal of invasive recordings is one of direct intervention, by delivering targeted brain stimulation as a treatment. But first you have to establish a firm relationship between neural activity and mood. Well, um, smartphone swipes (the way you interact with your phone) aim to establish a firm relationship between your “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6127813/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;smartphone usage based on not what you type, but how you type and scroll&quot;&gt;digital phenotype&lt;/a&gt;” and your mood. And then refer you to an app for a precision intervention. Or to your therapist / psychiatrist, who has to buy into use of the digital phenotyping software.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the invasive side of the question, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darpa.mil/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency&quot;&gt;DARPA&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/10/darpa-allocates-70-million-for.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;invested heavily&lt;/a&gt; in deep brain stimulation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_brain_stimulation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DBS&lt;/a&gt;)  as a treatment for &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/10/a-tale-of-two-brains-braini-and-darpas.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many disorders&lt;/a&gt; – Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depression, Borderline  Personality Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, Traumatic  Brain Injury, Substance Abuse/Addiction, Fibromyalgia/Chronic  Pain, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darpa.mil/program/restoring-active-memory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt;. None of the work has led to effective treatments (yet?), but the DARPA research model has established large centers of collaborating scientists who record from the brains of epilepsy patients. And a lot of very impressive papers have emerged – some &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2018/03/automatically-triggered-brain.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;promising&lt;/a&gt;, others &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2016/12/bad-news-for-darpas-ram-program.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;not so much&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One recent study (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)31313-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kirkby et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;) used machine learning to discover brain networks that encode variations in self-reported mood.

These biomarkers are generated from patterns in  smartphone use such as swipes, taps, and other touchscreen activities,  and are scientifically validated to provide measurements of cognition  and mood.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whither RDoC?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/directors/thomas-insel/blog/2014/a-new-approach-to-clinical-trials.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NIMH established a mandate&lt;/a&gt; requiring that  all clinical trials should postulate a neural circuit “mechanism” that would be responsible for any efficacious response. Thus, clinical investigators were forced to make up simplistic biological explanations for their psychosocial interventions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I hypothesize that the circuit mechanism for my elaborate new psychotherapy protocol which eliminates fear memories (e.g., specific phobias, PTSD) is implemented by down-regulation of amygdala activity while participants view pictures of fearful faces using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10683827&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Modulating emotional responses: effects of a neocortical network on the limbic system (Hariri et al. 2000)&quot;&gt;Hariri task&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pmX388J7Rr4/XGt6w1hr_UI/AAAAAAAAMwE/nx7MTMbBp-gGfaxR2zbGo-APmoN92vjcgCLcBGAs/s1600/Hariri%2Btask.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;409&quot; data-original-width=&quot;432&quot; height=&quot;302&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pmX388J7Rr4/XGt6w1hr_UI/AAAAAAAAMwE/nx7MTMbBp-gGfaxR2zbGo-APmoN92vjcgCLcBGAs/s320/Hariri%2Btask.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[a fictitious example]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm including a substantial portion of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/directors/thomas-insel/blog/2014/a-new-approach-to-clinical-trials.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;February 27, 2014 text&lt;/a&gt; here because it's important. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;NIMH is making three important changes to how we will fund clinical trials.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, future trials will follow an experimental medicine approach in which interventions serve not only as potential treatments, but as probes to generate information about the mechanisms underlying a disorder. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trial proposals will need to identify a target or mediator; a positive result will require not only that an intervention ameliorated a symptom, but that it had a demonstrable effect on a target, such as a neural pathway implicated in the disorder or a key cognitive operation. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;While experimental medicine has become an accepted approach for drug development, we believe it is equally important for the development of psychosocial treatments. It offers us a way to understand the mechanisms by which these treatments are leading to clinical change. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so the target &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;could&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; be a key cognitive operation. But let's say your intervention is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/communities/homelessness/housing-first.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Housing First&lt;/a&gt; initiative in homeless individuals with severe mental illness and co-morbid substance abuse. Your manipulation is to compare quality of life outcomes for&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/the-vancouver-at-home-study-overview-and-methods-of-a-housing-first-trial-among-individuals-who-are-homeless-and-living-with-mental-illness-2167-0870.1000123.php?aid=9838&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Housing First with Assertive Community Treatment vs. Congregate Housing with on-site supports vs. treatment as usual&lt;/a&gt;. What is the key cognitive operation here? Fortunately, this project was funded by the Canadian government and did not need to compete for NIMH funding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my ultimate issue is one of fundamental fairness. Is it OK to skate away from the wreckage and profit by making millions of dollars? From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2017/05/star-neuroscientist-tom-insel-leaves-google-spawned-verily-startup/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wired&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“I spent 13 years at NIMH really pushing on the neuroscience and  genetics of mental disorders, and when I look back on that I realize  that while I think I succeeded at getting lots of really cool papers  published by cool scientists at fairly large costs—I think $20 billion—I  don’t think we moved the needle in reducing suicide, reducing  hospitalizations, improving recovery for the tens of millions of people  who have mental illness,” Insel says. “I hold myself accountable for  that.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how? You've admitted to spending $20 billion on cool projects and cool papers and cool scientists who do basic research. This has great value. But the big mistakes were an unrealistic promise of treatments and cures, and the charade of forcing scientists who study &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; to explain how they're going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29594136&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Crossing the Worm-Brain Barrier by Using Caenorhabditis elegans to Explore Fundamentals of Human Psychiatric Illness&quot;&gt;cure psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Dr. Bruce Cuthbert was especially instrumental, as well as a large panel of experts.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; guest blogger &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rhi_willmot?lang=en&quot;&gt;Rhiannon Willmot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philosophers have long debated what constitutes genuine altruism. Some have argued that any acts, no matter however charitable, that benefit both the actor as well as the recipient, are altruistically “impure”, and thus can’t qualify as genuinely selfless. For example, volunteering at a soup kitchen would no longer be considered altruistic if we received a hot meal in return for our efforts.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, other scholars have argued that the act remains altruistic if the benefits of prosocial behaviour are an unintended consequence. From this perspective, if the meal is unexpected, our actions are still deemed selfless.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103117301701&quot;&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; Ryan Carlson and Jamil Zaki have shed light on these questions by investigating what the general population thinks of different prosocial acts, depending on their motives and consequences.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding popular perceptions of prosocial behavior can not only help resolve the altruism debate, but also provide information about how our behaviour might be viewed by others, and whether our personal opinions on selflessness match up with the general belief. For example, why might we perceive the supposedly altruistic behaviour of a public figure differently to our friends, and is social media really the right place to publicise prosocial acts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36423&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers first asked 270 participants on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk survey website to rate how altruistic they perceived behaviours in eight hypothetical scenarios. Participants in one group received only a description of the scenario (“Jane gives blood at a local clinic”), whereas participants in two other groups were also informed about what motivated the act (“Jane gives blood in order to impress her friends”), or about the consequences for the actors (“Jane gives blood, and impresses her friends”).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants told about the actor’s motives were influenced dramatically by what they read. They condemned behaviours driven by material or social gain as actively selfish, and even acting altruistically as a way to derive emotional benefit (for instance, to feel good) they viewed as significantly less altruistic than purely other-oriented activity. This suggests we discredit individuals who anticipate some kind of reward as a result of their prosocial behaviour, and that we are particularly harsh when this relates to receiving material gifts, or impressing others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing about consequences made less difference to participants’ judgments. However, they did rate behaviours that reaped material or social gain as slightly less altruistic than behaviours that obtained emotional rewards.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting results was that participants rated the same prosocial act as equally altruistic whether they were told explicitly that it had been carried out purely to help others or they were not given any information about motives. This contradicts the idea that people are naturally sceptical, and actually suggests we are likely to assume prosocial behaviour is carried out selflessly by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second study, Carlson and Zaki repeated their original experiment with more participants, and introduced a fourth group to investigate the role of neutral actions, such as going to the cinema. The results of study 1 were replicated, however Carlson and Zaki also found that if a prosocial action (that benefited others) was performed for material or social benefit then it was actually seen as less altruistic than neutral actions (that didn’t benefit others).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings suggest the precise motive for an act, rather than its consequence, is the main factor in determining whether we perceive the act as altruistic or not. This effect is so powerful in fact that it can lead us to define certain types of prosocial behaviour as less altruistic than actions which provide no benefits to others at all.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this perception exist? Carlson and Zaki conclude that our social judgments are influenced more by what drives people to act than the consequences they receive. This is because we use perceived motives to predict future behaviour. Those who are only prosocial under certain conditions are less reliable, and performing outwardly selfless acts for selfish reasons might even represent a deceptive and dangerous character.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the current work leave several avenues for further research. For example, it would be interesting to discover how judgements of altruism differ in populations who value the relative importance of intentions and consequences differently from the average perception, such as those with autism.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now these recent findings suggest that if you promote your charitable efforts on twitter, you could be viewed as less altruistic than someone who isn’t involved with prosocial behaviour at all. Ultimately, this comes down to whether we are viewed as seeking social glory, versus recruiting others to join a charitable cause. Whilst it seems humans take altruistic acts at face value when given no context, it is the appearance of our motive for acting that is key.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the list of failed replications &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/30/its-getting-increasingly-difficult-for-replication-crisis-sceptics-to-explain-away-failed-replications/&quot;&gt;continues to build&lt;/a&gt;, psychology’s reproducibility crisis is becoming harder to ignore. Now, in a new paper that seems likely to ruffle a few feathers, researchers suggest that even many apparent successful replications in neuroimaging research could be standing on shaky ground.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;As the paper’s title bluntly puts it, the way imaging results are currently analysed “allows presenting anything as a replicated finding.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provocative argument is put forward by YongWook Hong from Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea and colleagues, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/514521v1&quot;&gt;preprint posted recently to bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;. The fundamental problem, say the researchers, is that scientists conducting neuroimaging research tend to make and test hypotheses with reference to large brain structures. Yet neuroimaging techniques, particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), gather data at a much more fine-grained resolution.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that strikingly different patterns of brain activity could produce what appears to be the same result. For example, one lab might find that a face recognition task activates the amygdala (a structure found on each side of the brain that’s involved in emotional processing). Later, another lab apparently replicates this finding, showing activation in the same structure during the same task. But the amygdala contains hundreds of individual “voxels”, the three-dimensional pixels that form the basic unit of fMRI data. So the second lab could have found activity in a completely different part of the amygdala, yet it would appear that they had replicated the original result.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36458&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors’ arguments are not simply theoretical: in a series of experiments, Hong and colleagues demonstrate that replications are not always what they seem. The team used an imaging dataset they’d collected and published in a previous study, which examined the similarity of the brain’s responses to physical pain and social rejection. First, they divided the data into two groups, containing 30 and 29 participants respectively. For the sake of their demonstration, they pretended that these groups were two separate cohorts, the first group the “original” cohort, and the second a cohort used for a replication attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the kind of approach typically used in many neuroimaging experiments and replication attempts, they then examined the brain activity exhibited in response to rejection and pain in each of these groups, focusing on an area in the front of the brain called the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). The first group showed increased activity in the dACC to both rejection and pain – and so did the second, suggesting that the initial result had been successfully replicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the team looked within the dACC to see where in the structure activation was strongest, they found that the groups differed considerably. For the social rejection condition in particular, the location of this “peak” activation for the second group was a whopping 43mm away from the peak for the first group, at the opposite end of the dACC. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results might seem to suggest that the location of peak activation could provide a better indication of whether a finding has replicated than looking at average activity levels across a brain area. But in a subsequent experiment, the authors found that the location of peak activation didn’t actually have much bearing on the overall &lt;i&gt;pattern&lt;/i&gt; of activity. That is, there was a lot of information about the underlying distribution of activity that wasn’t captured by only looking at the peaks either.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors say that pattern-based analysis methods are a better option for figuring out whether or not a result has been replicated. Rather than simply looking at the average activity across a brain structure or where peak activation is, this kind of analysis uses information about the distribution of activity across many voxels and brain regions. This would allow researchers to directly compare the similarity of overall patterns of activity between studies. Alongside other improved methods of analysis, the authors say, “these practices will provide researchers with more robust spatial tests, helping us move one step towards resolving the current replication crisis in neuroimaging studies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they may be facing an uphill battle. In a survey of 135 previously published papers that claimed to have successfully replicated previous findings, Hong and his colleagues found that 85.3 per cent based their conclusions merely on finding activity in the same brain region as the original study, and more than 40 per cent didn’t even compare peak co-ordinates. A meagre 7.4 per cent conducted the kind of pattern-based analysis that the Hong’s team recommend. This suggests that it may be a while before the authors see their recommendations put into practice.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/514521v1&quot;&gt;False-positive neuroimaging: Undisclosed flexibility in testing spatial hypotheses allows presenting anything as a replicated finding&lt;/a&gt; [this paper is a preprint meaning that it has not yet been subjected to peer review and the final version published in a journal may differ from the version that this report was based on]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;NeuroFedora logo&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://neurofedora.github.io/images/NeuroFedoraLogo01.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 30%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagure.io/design/issue/602&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora logo by Terezahl from the Fedora Design Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;We continue to make progress on software that is to be included in
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/neuron&quot;&gt;neuron&lt;/a&gt; was approved for inclusion and is now in testing. This is without MPI
support, and does not currently contain Python bindings. These are both being
worked on now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/auryn&quot;&gt;auryn&lt;/a&gt; was approved for inclusion. While it builds fine on &lt;code&gt;x86_64,
i686, ppc64&lt;/code&gt;, it does not build on other secondary architectures:
&lt;code&gt;armv7hl, aarch64, s390x&lt;/code&gt;. So, we have filed a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/fzenke/auryn/issues/33&quot;&gt;ticket upstream&lt;/a&gt; to clarify if these are
supported. You can read more about the architectures Fedora supports &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;various other packages were updated to their latest versions: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=python-fsleyes&quot;&gt;fsleyes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=python-pydicom&quot;&gt;pydicom&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=python-nibabel&quot;&gt;nibabel&lt;/a&gt;. You
can test them by enabling the updates-testing repository and give feedback on
these updates (documented &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A number of packages need to be updated to their latest versions.
Unfortunately, a few of these bundle software that must be removed, so it
takes more time than simple updates: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1674578&quot;&gt;InsightToolkit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1371436&quot;&gt;vxl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1674946&quot;&gt;gdcm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We announced NeuroFedora on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neurostars.org/t/neurofedora-free-software-for-free-neuroscience/3594&quot;&gt;Neurostars&lt;/a&gt;
today also.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/neuralensemble/a4xnnPQ7dpM&quot;&gt;PyNN is being considered as an INCF standard/best practice&lt;/a&gt;. If you
do use it, please provide your comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neuro.fedoraproject.org&quot;&gt;NeuroFedora&lt;/a&gt; is volunteer driven initiative and contributions in any form always
welcome.  You can get in touch with us &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/overview/#_communicating_and_getting_help&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
We are happy to help you learn the skills needed to contribute to the project.
In fact, that is one of the major goals of the initiative---to spread technical
knowledge that is necessary to develop software for Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given how many of us listen to music while studying or doing other cerebral work, you’d think psychology would have a set of clear answers as to whether the practice is likely to help or hinder performance. In fact, the research literature is rather a mess (not that that has deterred some enterprising individuals from making &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/07/neuroscience-music-app/&quot;&gt;bold claims&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s the largely discredited “Mozart Effect” – the idea that listening to classical music can boost subsequent IQ, except that when first documented in the 90s the effect was on spatial reasoning specifically, not general IQ. Also, since then the finding has not replicated, or it has proven weak and is probably explained as a simple effect of music on mood or arousal on performance. And anyway, that’s about listening to music and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; doing mental tasks, rather than both simultaneously. Other research on listening to music &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; we do mental work has suggested it can be distracting (known as the “irrelevant sound effect”), especially if we’re doing mental arithmetic or anything that involves holding information in the correct order in short-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in the hope of injecting more clarity and realism into the literature, Manuel Gonzalez and John Aiello have tested the common-sense idea that the effects of background music on mental task performance will depend on three things: the nature of the music, the nature of the task, and the personality of the person. “We hope that our findings encourage researchers to adopt a more holistic, interactionist approach to investigate the effects of music (and more broadly, distractions) on task performance,” they write in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-03876-001&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36388&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 142 undergrads (75 per cent were women) and asked them to complete two mental tasks. The simpler task involved finding and crossing out all of the letter As in a sample of text. The more complex task involved studying lists of word pairs and then trying to recall the pairs when presented with just one word from each pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each task was performed while listening to one of two versions of a piece of elevator-style instrumental music – composed for the research – or no music. One version of the music was more complex than the other, featuring additional bass and drum tracks (both versions are available &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/xs85u/&quot;&gt;via the Open Science Framework&lt;/a&gt;). Also, depending on the precise experimental condition, the music was either quiet or louder (62 or 78 decibels). The participants also completed part of the “boredom proneness scale” to establish whether they were the kind of person who likes plenty of external stimulation or not (as measured by their agreement with statements like “it takes a lot of change and variety to keep me really happy”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants’ performance was explained by an interaction between the task, the music, and their preference for external stimulation. When performing the simpler task, participants not prone to boredom did better while listening to complex music than simple music or no music, whereas boredom prone participants showed the opposite pattern, performing better with no music at all or simple music. In terms of volume, the low boredom prone were better with quiet complex music, whereas the boredom prone did better with louder complex music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ explanation is that for low boredom people who aren’t so keen on external stimulation, the quieter, more complex music provided just enough distraction to stop them from mind wandering from the simple task, thus boosting their task focus and performance. In contrast, the more boredom prone participants who like external stimulation tuned in too much to the complex music and were overly distracted by it, thus performing worse than when working in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the more complex task, the precise nature of the music (its complexity and volume) made no difference to results. But people low in boredom proneness benefited from having any kind of music in the background (the researchers aren’t sure why, but perhaps there were mood or arousal-based benefits not measured in this study), whereas once again the boredom prone folk with a preference for external stimulation again actually performed better with no music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though these findings may seem counterintuitive, the researchers’ explanation is that, for boredom prone people, the complex task provided adequate stimulation and background music interfered with this productive engagement. Supporting this interpretation, the more boredom prone participants outperformed their less boredom prone peers at the task in the no-music condition (and at an earlier, baseline cognitive test), suggesting they engaged better with the tasks (the researchers additionally noted that this result challenges the way that boredom as an emotion is usually seen as a bad thing, suggesting “it can predict constructive outcomes, such as better complex task performance”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you consider yourself as prone to boredom and craving of external stimulation, a tentative implication of these findings – bearing in mind they are preliminary – is that you might be better off studying or do other cerebral work without music in the background, at least not music that is too complex. On the other hand, if you are less craving of stimulation, then paradoxically some background music could boost your performance. As the researchers stated: “we offer evidence against the commonly held belief that distractions like music will always harm task performance.” They added, “our findings suggest that the relationship between music and task performance is not ‘one-size-fits-all’. In other words, music does not appear to impair or benefit performance equally for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem with interpreting the results is in the ambiguity of the aspect of boredom proneness that the researchers looked at – “preference for external stimulation”. Past research has generally considered boredom proneness to be associated with less desirable aspects of personality, such as having less self-control and being more impetuous, and this could fit with the idea that boredom prone participants in this research were more distracted by background music. However, as mentioned, the participants scoring higher on “preference for external stimulation” generally performed better at the tasks, thus raising questions about what aspect of personality and/or mental aptitude was really being tapped by this measure. It doesn’t help matters that there was no direct measure of attentional control and focus in the study. (In terms of other relevant personality traits, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/07/neuroscience-music-app/&quot;&gt;prior research&lt;/a&gt; has found that introverts are more distracted than extraverts by highly arousing music).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other obvious limitations include the question of how much the featured tasks resemble real-life challenges, and the fact that people often listen to music they know and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/08/02/music-we-like-can-be-more-distracting-than-music-we-dont/&quot;&gt;like&lt;/a&gt; rather than unfamiliar, instrumental music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s laudable that the current research attempted to consider how various factors interact in explaining the effect of music on mental performance. Gonzalez and John Aiello concluded, “we hope our research will serve as a starting point for more systematic investigation of music.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-03876-001&quot;&gt;More than meets the ear: Investigating how music affects cognitive task performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/African-woman-with-baby-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent WHO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal_perinatal_health/anc-positive-pregnancy-experience/en/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for care during pregnancy and childbirth have emphasised the need for ensuring a positive experience for women. Respectful maternity care is a universal human right for every child-bearing woman around the globe, as advocated by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whiteribbonalliance.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;White Ribbon Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (WRA) and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are numerous studies showing that this right is not in place yet in many settings. The WRA published the Respectful Maternity Care (RMC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whiteribbonalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Final_RMC_Charter.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Charter&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, and thankfully more and more stakeholders are becoming aware of the need to treat women with dignity and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respectful maternity care is a universal human right … However, there are numerous studies showing that this right is not in place yet in many settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charter sets out various forms of disrespect and abuse (D&amp;amp;A) as well as the key areas of RMC that ensure patient-centered care. These include the right to information, informed consent and refusal, and respect for a woman’s choices and preferences, including companionship during maternity care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is growing evidence of D&amp;amp;A in maternity care, especially in low-resource settings. According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0123606&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; exploring the quality of care during childbirth in Kenya, up to 20% of women felt humiliated during labour and birth. Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://reproductive-health-journal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12978-015-0024-9&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in Ethiopia reported that women’s basic rights to information and informed consent were violated in all cases included in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set out to explore some of the reasons behind this. The results of our study, titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2189-7&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;‘We are the ones who should make the decision’ – Knowledge and understanding of the rights-based approach to maternity care among women and healthcare providers&lt;/a&gt;,” indicate that there is still a lot to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awareness of the RMC Charter and the problems it highlights is still very low among some of the key stakeholders in maternal and newborn health in our hospital in Malawi. This is especially true of healthcare providers, who are expected to act to prevent (not perpetuate) D&amp;amp;A and to treat women with respect and dignity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10829&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10829&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/Yellow-sari-baby-with-wrist-tie-300x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Indian woman in sari holding her 3 months old baby, India&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our study, we found that women valued skilled professional care at birth and recognised this to be of benefit to them, but they said they would prefer to be assisted by a student midwife who treats them with respect and dignity than by a qualified professional midwife who does not. This is a strong wake-up call to all stakeholders that RMC is no longer optional – it is an essential part of maternity care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study also highlights the importance of involving women in decisions about their health and that of their babies. We didn’t expect this finding given that the study was conducted in a setting where many women are still illiterate, and decisions are often taken at the family/community level rather than at the individual level. But the women who participated in our group discussions were very keen to be informed about their care and to be involved in the decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Way Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How best can we raise awareness about RMC? A &lt;a href=&quot;https://reproductive-health-journal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12978-018-0662-9&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paper by O’Connor&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues has proposed that for awareness-raising campaigns to be successful, there should be strategic planning to capture the attention of key stakeholders and to deliver persuasive messages. There needs to be a receptive environment that maximises the use of existing and potential resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating the principles of the RMC Charter into existing maternal and newborn services is a worthwhile effort. However, RMC should not be treated separately from the rest of the maternity services. It should be made an integral part of service delivery processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several studies (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://reproductive-health-journal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-4755-11-71&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bohren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;.) indicate that there is a strong link between the experience and perception of quality of care by women and the uptake of maternity services in low-resource settings, including skilled birth attendance. Eliminating D&amp;amp;A and providing high-quality professional maternity care will have a triple effect: women will be satisfied with the care they receive; healthcare providers will have a sense of satisfaction; and, with improved uptake of evidence-based care packages, maternal and newborn health outcomes will improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cmnh.lstmed.ac.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Centre for Maternal and Newborn Health&lt;/a&gt;, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, we work with stakeholders, including healthcare providers, and conduct implementation research in low-resource settings to improve the quality of maternal and newborn health services.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/BMCWordle-620x342-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-018-1381-7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Pediatrics: Do video game interventions improve motor outcomes in children with developmental coordination disorder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_coordination_disorder&quot;&gt;Developmental coordination disorder (DCD)&lt;/a&gt; occurs in approximately 5 to 6% of the school-aged population and can limit the academic, social, and physical abilities of the children it affects. Recent research has focused on using virtual reality and video game equipment to improve the motor skills of children with DCD.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-10821 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/video-games-1557358_1920-1-300x200.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Pixabay&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentiplay et al systematically reviewed 15 studies looking at the use of video games in DCD affected children. Nintendo Wii was the most commonly used intervention, appearing in 12 of the 15 studies. None of the studies included used virtual reality. While the studies included showed limited evidence to support the effectiveness of video games in improving the motor skills of DCD children, the majority of children both enjoyed and adhered to the video game interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-019-5286-0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Cancer: Human papilloma virus and breast cancer: the role of inflammation and viral expressed proteins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths among women. In the last twenty years, the breast cancer rate has been increasing worldwide. The link between human papilloma virus (HPV) and cervical cancer has been widely accepted. However, the link between viruses and breast cancer is less well-established. Recent studies have indicated that exposure to some viruses, including HPV, is a risk factor for breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HPV genome was detected in 48.6% of breast cancer samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent publication by Khodabandehlou et al, researchers determined the presence of HPV in breast cancer tissue. The HPV genome was detected in 48.6% of breast cancer samples. The researchers concluded that HPV is associated with breast cancer development but determining the exact mechanism and role of HPV in breast cancers will require further research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Materials: The newest addition to the BMC Series, now open for submissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BMC Series continued its expansion into the physical science and engineering this month with the opening of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmaterials.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Materials&lt;/a&gt;. The journal is now accepting submissions spanning the multi-disciplinary areas of materials science including fundamental and applied research in the synthesis, characterization, modelling and application of materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editor Harriet Manning, PhD recently published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2019/01/22/introducing-bmc-materials/&quot;&gt;blog &lt;/a&gt;describing the launch and how BMC Materials will meet the needs of the community by adding to the rapidly growing realm of open access materials science publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering and BMC Biomedical Engineering: First articles published&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the BMC Series’ recently launched engineering journals, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcchemeng.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Chemical Engineering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Biomedical Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, published their first articles this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the first publications are articles ranging in topics from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42490-019-0001-4&quot;&gt;history of robotic and laparoscopic surgery of the pancreas&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcchemeng.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42480-019-0002-z&quot;&gt;increasing the permeability of polymeric membranes in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-019-0906-y&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Family Practice: A survey of the attitudes, beliefs and knowledge about medical cannabis among primary care providers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis&quot;&gt;Cannabis&lt;/a&gt; is currently listed as a schedule I drug by the US Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. However, 29 US states and the District of Columbia have programs &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10824 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;178&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/computer-3343887_1920-300x178.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;allowing for the use of cannabis in specific medical conditions. Minnesota created its medical cannabis comprehensive program in May of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey conducted by Philpot et al, examines the attitude, beliefs, and knowledge about medical cannabis held by Minnesota primary care providers. They found that providers generally believe medical cannabis is a legitimate medical therapy. Greater than half of providers surveyed believed that medical cannabis is effective in the management of nausea and/or vomiting, muscle spasms, pain, and anxiety. However, 50% of providers surveyed indicated they “were not ready or did not want to answer patient questions about medical cannabis,” indicating that further work is needed to disseminate knowledge among primary care providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1031-4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Geriatrics: Deprescribing interventions and their impact on medication adherence in community-dwelling older adults with polypharmacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10822 alignright&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/pills-3673645_1920-300x180.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Medication adherence, the extent to which medications are taken following the instructions of a medical provider, is imperative to the management of many chronic diseases. However, estimates indicate that between 30 and 50% of people do not take their medications as prescribed. Adherence is particularly challenging in the older population because older people are often prescribed multiple medications and are sometimes affected by physical, cognitive, or sensory impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A systematic review conducted by Ulley et al, examined the impact of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprescribing&quot;&gt;deprescribing&lt;/a&gt; on medication adherence in an older population. They concluded that deprescribing did not improve medication adherence. However, they theorize that this may be because the interventions in the included studies did not sufficiently reduce the amount of medication being taken.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Reinoud Maex's journal club session, where he will summerise the work he did in Paris, which was sponsored by &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.catalystbiosciences.com/&quot;&gt;Targacept&lt;/a&gt;: a pharmaceutical company which specialised in nicotinic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicotine and nicotinic compounds bind to acetylcholine receptors, but, surprisingly, it is largely unknown whether they act by activating or by desensitising (= inactivating) these receptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We simulated a simple circuit of dopaminergic and gaba-ergic neurons, each of them expressing different subtypes of nicotinic receptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main conclusion was that many nicotinic compounds act by desensitising their receptors. We also formulated a new hypothesis on nicotine addiction. We propose that smoking in addicted people my be a form of self-medication: by desensitising the nicotinic receptors on GABAergic neurons, nicotine disinhibits the dopamine-neurons and restores their physiological response to acetylcholine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have a basic drive to learn and develop and to see themselves and the world in new ways. That’s according to the psychologists Arthur Aron and Elaine Aron, who refer to this as our need for “self-expansion”. It follows from their theory that any chance to self-expand should be rewarding, and that if you can self-expand while doing things with your romantic partner then your relationship will benefit. Previous research has hinted that this is the case, finding that when couples engaged in self-expanding activities together – anything that felt new, exciting, interesting and/or challenging – their satisfaction with their relationship increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-47337-001&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; Amy Muise at York University and her colleagues have taken things further, laying out evidence that a major part of the reason that participating in self-expanding activities is good for relationships is that it boosts your sexual desire for your partner and increases the likelihood you will have rewarding sex – and, moreover, that this is particularly the case for people in long-term relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36409&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two 21-day diary studies, the researchers recruited over 200 couples who had been in an exclusive relationship (most of them heterosexual) for an average of 8 years (the first study) or 5 years (the second).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each night the participants recorded on their own whether they had engaged in self-expanding activities with their partner that day (they answered questions like “How much did being with your partner expand your sense of the kind of person you are?” and “How much did you feel you gained a larger perspective on things because of your partner?”), and – in the second study only – they gave a specific example of an activity, if any, that they did with their partner that day that led to feelings of excitement, greater awareness, an expanded sense of self, and/or increased knowledge of the self and the world (see examples below). Participants also answered questions about their mood that day, overall time spent with their partner, their relationship satisfaction that day, their sexual desire for their partner, sexual satisfaction, and any sexual activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results across the two diary studies – the first conducted in Canada, the second in the USA – were similar: On days that participants reported engaging in more self-expanding activities with their partner, they also reported more sexual desire for their partner, were more likely to have sex, and to feel satisfied with that sex and their relationship. These associations were stronger for couples who’d been together longer. “Having new experiences with a long-term partner may be more important to spark some of the feelings of desire and excitement from the early stages of relationships, feelings that may be harder to recall for couples who are in longer compared with shorter relationships,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also some “dyadic effects” – that is, one person’s greater feelings of self-expansion were also associated with their partner tending to report greater sexual desire (perhaps because their partner was attracted by seeing them in a new light or seeing them undertaking new challenges), and both one’s own and one’s partner’s higher feelings of self-expansion were related to a greater likelihood of having sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings mostly remained statistically significant after controlling for any daily changes in mood, feelings of closeness, and time spent together; and a mediation analysis suggested that increased sexual desire was driving the association between greater feelings of self-expansion and increased sexual activity. Across the two diary studies, on days that self-expansion scores were high, the couples were between 25 and 34 per cent more likely to have sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diary research hinted at the direction of the causal effects in the measured outcomes – for instance, more self-expansion today was associated with more relationship satisfaction tomorrow, whereas the reverse was not true (relationship satisfaction today did not predict more self-expansion the next day). However, to test the causal role of self-expanding activities more explicitly, the researchers conducted a final experimental study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a weekend, the researchers tested whether coaching 51 couples to engage in more self-expanding activities together would lead them to experience the beneficial effects implied by the diary studies (the instructional advice came in the form of a fabricated magazine article that described the benefits of engaging together in new and exciting activities). For comparison, 65 couples looked at a fabricated article about the benefits of doing familiar things together, while another 82 couples acted as a no-intervention control and received no information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures taken at the end of the weekend showed that couples who read the self-expansion article heeded the advice and engaged in more self-expanding activities together; they were also the only group to enjoy a boost in sexual desire over the weekend compared with before, and there was also a non-significant trend for them to have more sex than couples in the other groups (75 per cent of the self-expansion couples said they’d had sex over the weekend, compared with 63 per cent in the familiar condition, and 58 per cent in the no-intervention control condition). The self-expansion couples also reported higher levels of sexual desire and relationship satisfaction than the no-intervention control couples, but not more than the couples encouraged to do familiar things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics may look at some of the examples of self-expanding activities that participants most frequently described in the second study (see above) – such as having a pizza and watching TV together, doing household chores together, or even, although less often, having an argument – and wonder where the feelings of self-expansion came from. What made some couples perceive such apparently mundane activities as self-expanding? The current research does not have any answers to this question, other than that the type of self-expanding activity and how physically arousing it was (as coded by researchers), did not appear to make any difference to the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the unexceptional nature of some of the activity examples suggests that, before rushing to book that tandem bungee jump or hot-air balloon ride, it is worth considering that the secret to self-expansion lies not so much in the precise nature of the activities you undertake together, and more in your perceptions of what you do and in the attitude and the mindset you bring – especially whether you can find the magic and mystery in the mundane. Exploring more about when and why and for whom this mindset is possible is for future research to consider. For now, Muise and her team conclude that “one way couples can promote desire in their relationship, and in turn, their relationship satisfaction and sexual connection, is by engaging in self-expanding activities together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-47337-001&quot;&gt;Broadening your horizons: Self-expanding activities promote desire and satisfaction in established romantic relationships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love it when preprints go on to be accepted as formal journal publications and we are especially excited to announce that &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204186&quot;&gt;EMT network-based feature selection improves prognosis prediction in lung adenocarcinoma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a featured preprint in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/10/live-streamed-preprint-journal-clubs/&quot;&gt;Open Access week event&lt;/a&gt;, is now published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, we celebrated OA Week’s theme of “Designing Equitable Foundations for Open Knowledge” by teaming up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.authorea.com/inst/14743-prereview&quot;&gt;PREreview&lt;/a&gt; to host &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.authorea.com/users/164141/articles/301936-about-live-streamed-prereview-journal-clubs-liveprejc&quot;&gt;virtual preprint journal clubs&lt;/a&gt; where researchers from around the world could share their expert opinions on preprints AND get credit for their reviews. Thanks to this event, the authors of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/410472v1&quot;&gt;this preprint&lt;/a&gt; received crowd-sourced feedback on their work even as their submission underwent formal peer review by &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author Borong Shao took advantage of the unique opportunity to participate in the discussion and we asked her to tell us what she thought of preprints and the virtual journal club experience. Read her thoughts below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell us a little bit about your research? What made you decide to post the work as a preprint?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We were working on the topic of molecular signature identification using multiple Omics data. The reason why we posted our work was to let our new results reach the research community. Based on our experience, preprint works are also read and discussed by researchers, as well as the formally accepted ones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does your field or research community feel about preprints in general?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In my opinion, preprints are welcomed if the work has a great idea to share. This can assist or even inspire other researchers in their work without waiting for the article to be formally accepted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about your experience discussing your preprint at a live journal club—How did you feel about the opportunity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was a bit nervous because I had no such experience before. I wondered whether the audience would have positive or negative opinions about my work, although I think my work has its value. I was excited too, because our work is read by researchers all over the world. Some of them are from a relevant but not the same discipline. I was curious to know their opinions on our manuscript.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you use any of the feedback from the virtual journal club? Did you find this kind of feedback useful in general?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both my professor and me found the suggestions from the virtual journal club very helpful. They gave us useful advice from the viewpoints of both readers and researchers. Much of the feedback can be implemented in a short time to improve the quality of our work. Some other feedback can be learned and used in our future research. There were a few mistakes that we might not have found out, if not learned from PREreview feedback.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preprints aren’t just helpful to authors– early comments from your community can also help editors at the journal conduct their evaluation of the work. &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE &lt;/em&gt;Academic Editor Aamir Ahmad had the opportunity to handle Dr. Shao’s submission and felt that the early feedback process was “a great initiative… the feedback was excellent in general and the authors did a good job of incorporating the changes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS wholeheartedly supports preprints and the myriad &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/why-preprint&quot;&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; they offer researchers.  We’re making it easier for authors to share their work as a preprint, immediately upon submission, through our posting service in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/12/plos-authors-say-yes-to-preprints/&quot;&gt;partnership with bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt; and we were happy to find another partner in PREreview who have pioneered live preprint journal clubs for early discussions like these to take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find more information on preprints &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/preprints&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and live-streamed journal clubs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.authorea.com/users/164141/articles/301936-about-live-streamed-prereview-journal-clubs-liveprejc&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Please also join us in congratulating Dr. Shao and her co-authors on their recent publication!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 Since last year, a half-dozen researchers have been having a debate: Should the humanities focus on replication? No, said Sarah de Rijcke and Bart Penders in Nature last August: “Resist calls for replicability in the humanities.” In the most recent piece on this subject, de Rijcke and Penders were joined by J. Britt Holbrook to again … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2019/02/13/do-the-humanities-need-a-replication-drive-a-debate-rages-on/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Do the humanities need a replication drive?

&lt;p&gt;Imagination is sometimes claimed to be a uniquely human ability, and it has long intrigued psychologists. “Nevertheless, our understanding of the benefits and risks that individual differences in imagination hold for psychological outcomes is currently limited,” note two researchers who have created a new psychometric test – the Imaginative Behaviour Engagement Scale (IBES) – for measuring how much imagination a person has, and then used it to investigate whether, as some earlier work hinted, having a stronger imagination might aid learning and creativity.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36380&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Sophie von Stumm at the University of York and Hannah Scott at UCL, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12369&quot;&gt;writing in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, imagination is the tendency to create “mental representations of concepts, ideas and sensations in the mind that are not contemporaneously perceived by the senses [and ranges] from the re-creation of images or sensory perceptions in the mind that were previously seen and experienced in reality ….to crafting images anew independent of prior actual sensory input.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not exactly a snappy definition. But that’s partly a consequence of what the pair terms the “definition and measurement issues” that have plagued academic inquiry into imagination, including a lack of agreement among psychologists on a precise definition that distinguishes it from related constructs, such as fantasy or mental imagery.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To research what the new test should include, von Stumm and Scott conducted a literature search and interviews with “expert psychometricians”. This led them to identify seven “domains of imagination” and their test includes two items measuring each of these, including how much a person: had imaginary friends as a child; is inclined to daydreaming; dreams; thinking styles (for example: “Do you ever play around with ideas just for fun?”); how often they feel a sense of feeling transported while reading a book or watching a movie; their “imaginative responsiveness” (for example: “If you wished, could you imagine that you had an additional arm so much that you would feel the limb and its movements?”) and their proclivity for fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first study, the pair explored links between imagination (based on the IBES), personality and learning performance in 180 participants who were mostly undergraduate students. After taking an initial logical thinking test and then studying a scholarly text, the participants were immediately tested, and then later re-tested a week later, to see what they could remember of the text. They also completed the IBES and personality surveys at various time-points. Their IBES scores correlated with their learning ability, but only very weakly and not as strongly as did their scores on the logical thinking test and on Openness to Experience (one of the Big Five personality traits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second study of 128 mostly British members of the general population, von Stumm and Scott looked for any associations between measures of imagination and creativity and schizotypal beliefs. (Schizotypal beliefs include odd beliefs and magical thinking, suspiciousness – and also unusual perceptual experiences). The researchers also considered the participants’ scores on facets of Openness to Experience, including the Fantasy facet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants’ scores on imagination correlated with just one aspect of their creativity known as “creative ideation” (defined as the use of, appreciation of and skill with ideas, assessed using a self-report scale). Notably, imagination scores were &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; related to creative ability, which was measured using tests that asked the participants to write down as many uses as they could think of for a ping pong ball, a plank of wood and a paperclip (responses were scored for originality and functionality), nor with real-life creative achievements. On the other hand, a stronger imagination &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; correlated more strongly with the schizotypal belief scales and the Fantasy facet of the Openness to Experience personality trait (in fact, as the authors note, their new IBES test seemed to be tapping something very similar to the Fantasy personality facet) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that being more imaginative – as measured in this study – is associated more with having schizotypal beliefs (or non-helpful “cognitive eccentricities”) rather than being something that’s useful in accumulating knowledge or producing new and useful ideas. This may be because learning and (to a certain extent) creativity require focused attention. “We propose here that the shared lack of executive control in imagination and schizotypal beliefs gives rise to their association and differentiates them from effortful, more regulated cognitive processes like learning and creativity,” von Stumm and Scott write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem with the study, though, is in the wording used to tap participants’ creative ideation and imagination, compared with the test for creative ability, and also creative achievement (which measured their total creative achievements – such as having a song recorded – in their lives to date) . For the first two, participants reported their &lt;i&gt;typical &lt;/i&gt;behavior, whereas for creative ability and achievement, their maximum ability was measured – this discrepancy could have easily skewed the results and led to lower correlations between imagination and creative ability/achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it’s worth noting that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4217346/&quot;&gt;other work&lt;/a&gt; has found an association between schizotypy and creativity, so “cognitive eccentricities” may sometimes be useful. It’s hard, too, to believe that the strength of one’s imagination would be essentially irrelevant to one’s creative ability – in certain fields, anyway. JK Rowling, for instance, may have applied herself to the focused job of constructing a coherent plot, but without a strong, unfocused imagination, it’s hard to see how she would have achieved her creative success.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, then, do the results really show? The clearest suggestions from all this correlational data seem to be that if you have a strong imagination, this won’t help you with academic study. It might mean that you’re more likely to hold unconventional beliefs. It’s also associated with creative thinking, though not creative ability and achievement (at least not as measured in this study).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clearer idea of how the strength of imagination affects various outcomes in life will require longitudinal research. Certainly, the debate about what exactly imagination is – and how it may help or hinder us – is not over yet.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12369&quot;&gt;Imagination links with schizotypal beliefs, not with creativity or learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

With core competence in gene synthesis, GenScript can synthesize any sequence at any length or complexity for all biologics-focused purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GenScript’s capabilities for recombinant protein expression in a variety of host organisms, along with antibody engineering and production capabilities in major host animals, have proven to be effective in the development of novel biologics. All of GenScript’s biologics-focused platforms are highly customizable, ensuring that the specific needs of each client’s project are addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capacity of GenScript’s platform for high-throughput and scalable production also helps our customers to move through the optimization process quickly but efficiently. Two out of many of our success stories in this regard are the successful generation and application of a therapeutic antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma, and generation of a novel HIV vaccine with high efficiency and low toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has stood in the supermarket aisle trying to remember their shopping list might have wished for a larger brain. But when it comes to memory, bigger isn’t always better. A study &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393218307280&quot;&gt;published in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393218307280&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neuropsychologia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has found that young children whose cerebral cortex is thinner in certain areas also tend to have better working memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36374&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of previous brain imaging studies already found that working memory – which we use for remembering and manipulating pieces of information over short timescales – involves a network of brain areas in both the frontal and parietal cortices.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most of these studies examined adults and older children, and few researchers have investigated younger children aged 4 to 6. At this age, children’s working memory usually improves drastically, so it’s important to understand what is going on in the brain, especially if this could help children with learning difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Morgan Botdorf and Tracy Riggins from the University of Maryland scanned the brains of 189 healthy children with no known learning difficulties aged between 4 and 8. An impressive 186 of the children remained still enough during the scan to provide usable data.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate session outside of the MRI scanner, the researchers also assessed the kids’ working memory using the forward digit span task, which measures how many digits a child can hold in their memory.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Botdorf and Riggins then looked at how performance on this test was related to the thickness of four brain areas known to be important in working memory: the superior frontal cortex, middle frontal cortex, superior parietal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. They found that in all four regions, children with &lt;em&gt;thinner&lt;/em&gt; grey matter tended to be able to hold more numbers in memory – they had what psychologists call “a higher digit span”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this result might seem counter-intuitive, it is not completely unexpected that a thinner cortex in these areas is related to better memory. During development, connections between neurons are “pruned”, restructuring and streamlining the brain in a way that is thought to improve memory and cognition, and the study authors suggest that this process is taking place in their participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at whether these key brain regions were thinner in the older children – and if so, whether this could help explain why older children generally have better working memory. One region did seem to be involved in the effects of aging on working memory: older children had a thinner anterior cingulate cortex, which in turn was related to having a higher digit span. The researchers suggest that in young children, the anterior cingulate cortex “may be developing particularly rapidly” and so have an important role in the cognitive changes that occur in early childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from age, a number of other factors could influence the thickness of cortical areas. Previous research has implicated genetics and lifestyle factors like vitamin consumption and stress, for example, though the researchers note that the evidence for these is often sketchy. “A ripe avenue for future research would be to focus on identifying specific factors that impact the structure of the cortex, particularly during early childhood,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a better understanding of what causes cortical thinning, researchers could begin to figure out how to intervene to facilitate these changes and improve working memory in children at risk of memory impairments. This is an important consideration as working memory is strongly related to educational achievement at school, and so the new study is a step in the right direction.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the new research is that it only looked at children’s ability to store verbal information, not other important functions of working memory, such as remembering visual information. It remains to be seen whether these other aspects of memory are also related to the thickness of young children’s grey matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393218307280&quot;&gt;When less is more: Thinner fronto-parietal cortices are associated with better forward digit span performance during early childhood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/Fotolia_79987031_Subscription_Yearly_XXL-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10813&quot; style=&quot;width: 1010px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10813&quot; height=&quot;668&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/Fotolia_79987031_Subscription_Yearly_XXL.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;BMI (body mass index) is used to determine whether a person is a healthy body weight. But it has flaws.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;© Sherry Young / Fotolia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as I remember, people told me to always exercise and eat well to stay fit and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite recent efforts in both the public and private sector to promote the consumption of healthier foods and motivate people to be more physically active, obesity remains a major concern worldwide. There are currently about 2 billion people overweight, of which 650 million are obese, indicating that obesity has nearly tripled since 1975 (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight&quot;&gt;WHO, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being overweight or obese is highly discouraged, as it is a major risk factor of high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke and heart failure amongst many other pathologies. Obesity would also have an immediate impact on your mental health and amount to a reduced quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we know that obesity is also a risk factor for the development of colorectal cancer, at the GUTS laboratory we wanted to investigate the impact of obesity and body composition on survival after cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you measure obesity and body composition?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are generally considered obese when they have a body mass index (BMI) of more than 30. You can calculate your own BMI by dividing your weight in kg by the square of your height in meters (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). A healthy BMI should be between 20-24.9 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. People with a BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2 &lt;/sup&gt;are overweight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major problem with BMI scales is that they do not distinguish between fat and muscle mass and do not accurately reflect the lipid content and inflammation occurring in the fat tissue. People with a high muscle mass and low fat mass, a condition often linked to a healthy lifestyle, may therefore have the same BMI as people with almost no muscle but with a high amount of fat tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with a similar BMI but a completely different body composition. (A) Patient with sarcopenia or low muscle mass. This patient also has a high amount of body fat. (B) Patient with a high body mass and normal fat mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10811&quot; style=&quot;width: 871px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10811&quot; height=&quot;361&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/figure-1.png&quot; width=&quot;861&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Patients with a similar BMI but a completely different body composition. (A) Patient with sarcopenia or low muscle mass. This patient also has a high amount of body fat. (B) Patient with a high body mass and normal fat mass.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Image provided by authors&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, some other techniques are currently available that give a much better estimation of your body composition including computed tomography (CT)-scans. CT-scans can not only provide you with information on the amount of whole-body fat and muscle mass, but they can also give you some qualitative information on your body tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To study the influence of BMI and body composition on survival in cancer patients, we performed detailed body composition analyses on CT scans of 217 patients with advanced colorectal cancer that do not respond to chemotherapy. Much to our surprise, we found that in this patient population, obese patients had a better survival than non-obese patients. Obesity is a known risk factor for colon cancer incidence, so why would it be beneficial in our study?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are also the first to show that not only the amount of fat tissue, but even more importantly, the quality or density of fat has an impact on your survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One explanation could be a different role of obesity depending on the stage of the disease.  Where the adverse metabolic and inflammatory status linked to obesity takes precedence in the acquisition of colorectal cancer and the early stages of the disease, a larger amount of energy stored in your fat tissue becomes increasingly important and beneficial in an advanced stage of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hypothesis is also supported by our more detailed body composition data showing that not only a high amount of muscle mass but also fat mass is beneficial in a late stage of the disease. We are also the first to show that not only the amount of fat tissue, but even more importantly, the quality or density of fat has an impact on your survival. Whether the prognostic impact of adipose tissue density in our study is mediated by malnutrition, the role of inflammation, and/or an altered function of the fat cells, is currently being investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, our study shows that beyond the analysis of specific tumor mutations, which is often the only element used for personalized treatment, we should also take into account the physical state and the patient’s body composition in patient’s treatment decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/02/12/obesity-paradox-impact-body-composition-cancer-survival/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The obesity-paradox: impact of body composition on cancer survival&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;BMC Series blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/iStock-641963334-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why focus on healthy weight gain in pregnancy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gestational weight gain (GWG) outside of guidelines is linked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28586887&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;negative health consequences&lt;/a&gt; for both the mother and her baby. Pregnant women who gain weight in accordance with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK32813/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;US Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, also adopted for use in Australia (where we did our study), have the lowest risk of pregnancy and birth-related complications. Women who gain more are more likely to experience high blood pressure and diabetes in pregnancy, longer hospital stays after birth, and Cesarean sections. They are also more likely to have trouble losing weight after the baby is born and to have difficulty breastfeeding. Women who do not gain enough weight are more likely to deliver their baby early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less than a third of pregnant women gain the right amount.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of over 1 million pregnant women, linked above, 47% had GWG greater than and 23% had GWG less than IOM recommendations. With the service changes made in our hospital’s antenatal care processes, we have been able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1747-0080.12475&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;document significant reduction in excess GWG&lt;/a&gt; (decreasing from 57.3% to 32.6%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we support women’s healthy weight gain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10803&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10803&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/iStock-494561744-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Stethoscope with financial statement [credit: Mater Mothers’ Hospitals]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;In pregnancy, weighing as a stand-alone intervention does not reduce excessive GWG. However, approaches that include dietary advice and physical activity, supported by ongoing weight monitoring, can prevent excessive GWG. Routine weighing is &lt;a href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1471-0528.13790&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;acceptable&lt;/a&gt; to women and has not been shown to increase anxiety or distress. It is also a valuable opportunity to act and counsel women to support a healthy pregnancy. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1471-0528.13511&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many services do not regularly weigh pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;, often due to historical routines and beliefs .&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you build it (properly), they will come.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gut instinct says that if you tell people what to do they will do it – disseminate guidelines, deliver training, display posters – but evidence shows otherwise. Just as telling someone they need to exercise regularly for good health rarely results in a long-term change in routine, similarly, a more nuanced and tailored approach is required to facilitate sustainable changes in healthcare delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1748-5908-1-1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Implementation Science&lt;/a&gt; – the field of scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practices into routine care. The approach we took in our large tertiary maternity service follows the recommended steps to develop effective health care interventions. In this case, we wanted behaviors of health professionals, teams, and the organization to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who needs to do what, differently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What barriers and enablers need to be addressed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which intervention components (behavior change techniques and modes of delivery) could help?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can behavior change be measured and understood?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a body of work that synthesized data from the literature, clinical observations, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-13-117&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23216325&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;surveys &lt;/a&gt;(i.e. theory, evidence, and practical issues), we followed this four-step approach to select the most appropriate components of &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mcn.12266&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our implementation intervention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elements of a system-wide intervention to improve GWG guideline adherence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10804&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10804&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/IMG_2774-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;credit: Mater Mothers’ Hospitals&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early steps in our work resulted in a number of service and system changes, informed by our use of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1748-5908-7-38&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;theoretical domains framework&lt;/a&gt; (TDF). This allowed us to sort and categorize the barriers we faced to achieving best GWG practice. The domains from the TDF relevant to our maternity service included: &lt;em&gt;Knowledge&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Skills&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Social and professional role/identity&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Beliefs about capabilities&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; Environmental context and resources.&lt;/em&gt; This led to us increasing dietitian time in clinic (including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-12-131&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dietitian-led early antenatal workshop&lt;/a&gt;), development of GWG resources for maternity staff to use (including a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellness.mater.org.au/Our-Services/Nutrition-and-Dietetics/Outpatients/The-Mater-Personalised-Pregnancy-Weight-Tracker-©&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Weight tracker&lt;/a&gt;), and staff training around GWG. Our changes were small but targeted – made within service capacity and with reorientation of existing resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We showed better compliance with individual guideline elements but overall adherence did not improve. The focus of this research related to the same identified gaps, and strategies were implemented in stages including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;staff in-services training outlining and incorporating the evidence into practice via voiceover PowerPoint presentation (2014),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;obtaining scales for each antenatal clinic room (2014), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;removal of a default ‘skip’ option from the e-health record where weight is recorded, to promote mandatory entries (September 2016).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is more effective for ensuring weight recording in pregnancy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-018-2162-x&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This study&lt;/a&gt; assessed the cumulative influence of these interventions on staff’s compliance to recording of antenatal weights. Using routinely collected data across the same periods of our interventions allowed us to easily compare staff’s documentation of women’s weights at antenatal visits to measure how each intervention affected practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across three 15-month cohorts (from April 2014 to December 2017), there were approximately 39,000 pregnancies. The proportion of women who had a weight recorded at each visit per cohort differed significantly between cohorts, from 4.2% (baseline) to 18.9% (scales and in-services) to 61.8% (medical record prompts) (p &amp;lt;0.001). Improvements were observed across the entire service, in all models of care and with all professional groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think global, act local.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliance on memory to follow recommended practices from guidelines less-consistently elicits behavior change compared to routine structural changes to facilitate their implementation. Our interventions showed greater improvements than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001096.pub2/full&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previously documented for reminder systems&lt;/a&gt; (usually only ~4%), perhaps through being uniquely tailored to the local barriers. Simple system changes appear to be most effective for sustainable outcomes in this instance of antenatal weight recording. This reflects findings from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publish.csiro.au/AH/AH17255&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent eHealth review&lt;/a&gt; that highlighted substantial improvements in accuracy and completeness of clinical information as well as guideline adherence when electronic medical records are integrated into workflow processes (used at the point of care). Future guideline implementation projects should look beyond education sessions to harnessing systems and technology which will support their desired changes.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-5822 size-large&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/the-old-lady-3503684_1920-1024x683.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good Cholesterol Can Positively Impact Women’s Brain Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistics bear out the folk wisdom that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1018115&quot;&gt;women live longer than men&lt;/a&gt;. However, living longer doesn’t necessarily equate to living better. All too often, dementia robs older women of what could be the happiest time of their lives. And while medical science continues to try to solve the problem of dementia, to date, there is no cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease represents approximately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dementia.org.au/about-dementia/types-of-dementia/alzheimers-disease&quot;&gt;60-80% of all dementia cases&lt;/a&gt;, but it is just one of approximately 50 known causes of dementia. Yet, we’ve hardly even scratched the surface on treating Alzheimer’s, let alone those many other lesser-known causes. Nearly two-thirds of those suffering from dementia are women, yet &lt;a href=&quot;https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/how-good-cholesterol-can-keep-women-s-brains-healthy&quot;&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; have only performed a handful of studies to study how the disease progresses in females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, two&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11682-018-9887-z&quot;&gt; recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11682-018-9970-5&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medicine.unimelb.edu.au/research-groups/medicine-and-radiology-research/royal-melbourne-hospital/healthy-ageing-program/womens-healthy-ageing-project&quot;&gt;Women’s Healthy Ageing Project&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Melbourne are now bringing to light not only how dementia develops in women, but also how women can delay or prevent it. Much of the research points to two systems of the body — the cardiovascular system (heart) and the nervous system (brain) — and how they work in tandem to either slow down or speed up the development of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grey and White Matter and Dementia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of brain matter: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/18117.htm&quot;&gt;white matter and grey matter. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers discovered the amount of grey matter a woman has at age 60 can serve as a reliable predictor of her memory ability at age 70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe that one sure sign of dementia in older adults is a decrease in grey matter volume. What’s new about the research at the University of Melbourne, however, is how to potentially &lt;em&gt;prevent&lt;/em&gt; this decline in grey matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where the cardiovascular system comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brains require a lot of blood, and proper circulation is critical to ensuring our brains receive not only the rich oxygen blood provides but also valuable nutrients and fats the brain needs to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Role Does Cholesterol Play in Brain Health?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One simple rule when it comes to heart health and brain health is:  ‘what’s good for your heart is good for your brain’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dementia Australia recommends five steps to reduce your risk of dementia, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://yourbrainmatters.org.au/5-simple-steps/step-1-look-after-your-heart&quot;&gt;‘Look after your heart’&lt;/a&gt; is rule number one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bad:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When women develop a high level of LDL, or ‘bad’ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/hdl-good-ldl-bad-cholesterol-and-triglycerides&quot;&gt;cholesterol,&lt;/a&gt; it clogs blood vessels and decreases blood flow to the brain. Starving the brain of oxygen and nutrients causes grey matter mass to decline. White matter also sustains damage from lack of adequate blood flow, meaning the different parts of the brain no longer “talk” to each other the way they previously did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result, predictably, is a drastic decline in cognitive function, including the ability to remember learned information and the ability to form new memories. When allowed to continue unchecked, dementia develops at a much faster rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The good:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, women with normal levels of the ‘good’ cholesterol, called HDL which carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver showed less &lt;em&gt;white matter&lt;/em&gt; damage in their brain a decade later when they conducted late-life brain MRI scans and cognitive assessments 20 years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Women’s Healthy Ageing Project researchers point out that maintaining healthy levels of cholesterol impacts on the structure of the brain directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To lower your risk of developing dementia, or to stave it off as long as possible, it’s critical to talk to your doctor about getting your cholesterol under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest strategies to target major cardiovascular risk factors at midlife might also be effective in reducing the development of brain lesions and late life cognitive decline,”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;says Professor Szoeke, one of the lead researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And while our findings relate to women, we know healthy lifestyles are important for men to maintain their brain health, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Dopamine, and the art of feedback&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HzbzdAVc7_sjhnhsEzUu-Q.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Credit: Pixabay&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deep success story of modern neuroscience is the theory that dopamine neurons signal a prediction error, the error between what reward you expected and what you got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its success runs deep. It has been supported by converging evidence from the firing of neurons, the release of dopamine, and the blood-flow seen in fMRI. That evidence has been gathered across diverse species, from humans, monkeys, rats, and bees. There is even causal evidence that forcing dopamine neurons to fire sends error signals in the brain, effects we can see in the behaviour of the animals whose dopamine neurons are being toyed with. The theory bridges data from the scale of human behaviour down to the level of single neurons. Unlike many theories for the brain, this one is properly computational, and makes multiple, non-trivial predictions that have turned out to be true. Dopamine and errors in predictions are intimately intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this intimate link raises a bigger but rarely articulated question. It’s perfectly possible to build a brain that learns from errors without any explicit representation of that error in the brain. So why does the brain have an error signal for rewards at all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand that question, first we need to know a little about the prediction error theory itself. The theory says that dopamine neurons fire to unexpectedly good things. If I suddenly tap you on the shoulder and hand you a sweet, your dopamine neurons go ping! for the sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I keep tapping you on the shoulder, and keep giving you a sweet, your dopamine neurons stop going ping for the sweet — getting a sweet is great but it is no longer unexpected (and frankly you’d rather I respected your personal space a bit more). Instead, the dopamine neurons go ping! for the tap itself. This is the clever bit: the neuron goes ping! because the tap on the shoulder now reliably predicts a sweet is coming (a good thing), but it’s unexpected because you don’t know when the tap is coming — so the tap on the shoulder becomes the unexpectedly good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theory also says that dopamine neurons, like people, are deeply upset by their routines being violated. Having established this relationship of trust — me repeatedly tapping you on the shoulder and you at least getting a series of sweets out of this violation of social norms — what happens if I tap you on the shoulder and then don’t give you a sweet? Your dopamine neurons then shut down completely, stop firing at all for a brief period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, dopamine neurons send a rapid signal that covers all three possible errors in predicting a reward: that the reward was better than expected (a positive error); that the reward was exactly as expected (no error); or that the reward was less than expected (a negative error). We can label all this using one of those torturous compound nouns beloved of scientists: dopamine neurons send a reward prediction error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This correspondence between dopamine and “reward prediction error” has its roots in the branch of AI called reinforcement learning (well, technically, it’s a branch of machine learning, but as everything is now labelled AI, including a FitBit which I’m pretty sure is just an accelerometer with a strap, then AI it is). Reinforcement learning is the accumulation of algorithms for how something can learn from being told only how wrong or right its own predictions were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the classic algorithms of reinforcement learning have an explicit signal for the error in predicting how valuable a choice will be (where the roll call of algorithms include bandits, Temporal Difference learning, Q learning, SARSA, or Actor-Critic). This is the signal between the predicted value of what happens next, and the actual value of what happens next — where value is measured by the expected amount of future reward. The magic of reinforcement learning is that by simply minimising this error between the predicted and actual value of each next thing in the world, an artificial agent can learn remarkably complex sequences of events, like navigating across a world, or how to run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is the computational part of the dopamine theory: that the rapid responses of dopamine neurons just are the prediction error of reinforcement learning algorithms. That they are the error between the predicted and actual value of what happens next. And that they are used to learn. The key to this theory is not just that the dopamine neurons signal the difference between what reward you got and what you expected. It is that they also transfer that signal to unexpected things that predict reward, exactly as reinforcement learning algorithms say they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that dopamine neuron are only encoding this prediction error. There are many nuances to what dopamine neurons themselves may be interested in, a super-set of things beyond prediction errors. And indeed errors in predicting reward are but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438817301587?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;a sub-set of the possible errors in predictions about the world&lt;/a&gt; that could exist in the brain (a story for next time). But that dopamine neurons encode an error in predicting reward seems a well-established part of what they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(And this proposed correspondence between the rapid response of dopamine neurons and a prediction error is true of more elaborate reinforcement learning algorithms too, such as the exciting revival and extension of Peter Dayan’s “successor representation” idea by Sam Gershman, Ida &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0180-8#auth-1&quot;&gt;Momennejad&lt;/a&gt;, Kim Stachenfeld and colleagues. In the successor representation account, there is not one simple error between what you predicted and what you got, but a whole vector of errors about predictions for changes to different features of the world — one of which is reward. &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2018.1645&quot;&gt;A recent paper&lt;/a&gt; from Gershman and colleagues shows how thinking of the rapid dopamine neuron response as the sum of those errors can explain some perplexing recent findings about dopamine neurons sending rapid signals to changes in the world that aren’t reward.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there was no need for this correspondence twixt neuron and theoretical error signal to exist. The algorithms of reinforcement learning are based on observations of animal behaviour. And they can be very successful: animals, including humans, often really do behave like they are using a prediction error in reward to learn about the world. But just because we can describe behaviour using an error in prediction about reward, it does not follow that there has to be such an explicit error signal in the brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For it is perfectly possible to construct a system that learns about the world using feedback that does not have an explicit signal for the error in its predictions. One example of these systems is &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1561/2200000049&quot;&gt;a Bayesian agent&lt;/a&gt;, one that learns about the probabilities of things in the future, rather than certainties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1560&quot;&gt;Such a Bayesian agent&lt;/a&gt; might represent the uncertainty about what the value of taking action A will be. This uncertainty will encoded by a probability distribution — which we might write P(value|action A) — for the possible values of taking action A. For example, there might be a high probability that taking action A will have a low value, and a low probability it will have a high value; or vice-versa; or something far more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We plonk our poor Bayesian agent in the dullest world imaginable. Its entire life consists of choosing which of three levers it should pull in order to win a coin, over and over again. As the chances of winning a coin are different between the three levers, so the agent has to work out which to pull in order to get the most coins in the long run. Three levers, so three possible actions, so three corresponding probability distributions for the value of each lever. Each round the agent picks a lever based on those probability distributions — perhaps it tends to pick the one which currently gives the highest probability of the largest reward — and watches for the coin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coin or not, the agent uses the outcome to update its probability distribution. A coin is evidence that the lever is good, so the agent increases the probability that pulling the lever has a high value; no coin is evidence that the lever is no good, so the agent increases the probability that pulling the lever has a low value. Either way, the agent now has more information about the action it chose, regardless of whether it was a good outcome or a bad outcome. The probability distribution for that action is updated to reflect that information by changing the parameters of the distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no error signal. The agent is learning from feedback about the world, and can use its learning to make decisions, but has no prediction error signal. Sure, we could construct one — by computing the difference between the probability distributions before and after the coin arrived — but we don’t need one. The error signal is implicit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, this is behaviour, not yet the brain. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2004.10.007&quot;&gt;many believe&lt;/a&gt; the brain represents the world using probability distributions; and there are plausible theories for &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.3495&quot;&gt;how to represent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2010.01.003&quot;&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; probability distributions using neurons. These boil down adjusting the firing of the population of neurons representing a probability distribution. And you do that &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004485&quot;&gt;by adjusting the strengths of the inputs&lt;/a&gt; to those neurons (whether those inputs be from within the population or outside it). So the brain just needs a signal about whether or not a reward occurred, and use that to adjust connections. No complicated signal about the error in predictions is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a brain could learn from reinforcement with or without an explicit signal for errors in predicting that reinforcement. But the brain does have an explicit error signal encoded by dopamine neurons. What does this tell us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it tells us three interesting ideas for how the brain works. I think — fully prepared to be wrong about this, and for there to be a water-tight argument for why you can’t build a brain without an explicit signal for errors in predicting reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first idea is that the existence of an explicit error signal implies the existence of a simple representation of the world in the brain. A so-named “model-free” representation that does not represent every possible outcome of an action, and likely does not use probability either. A quickly accessible look-up table of the values of actions, that is used to choose actions when time is pressing or the world is unchanging. We already have &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2011.02.009&quot;&gt;some good ideas&lt;/a&gt; of where such representations live in the brain. And all forms of such simple representations we know about require an explicit signal for the error between actual and predicted values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second idea is that what is one concept in reinforcement learning is actually two processes in the brain. The one concept in reinforcement learning is that you use the error in your prediction to change your estimate of an action’s value. Why is this two processes in the brain? Because the brain might want to separately control short-term and long-term changes in the estimates of an action’s value. And having an explicit error signal carried by dopamine lets it do both with one signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get long-term changes we could adjust our estimate of an action’s value by changing up or down the strength of connections onto neurons representing that action. Adjusting our estimate of value in this way changes long-term behaviour. And the rapid dopamine signal is indeed &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002034&quot;&gt;thought to control&lt;/a&gt; whether and in which direction some connections in the brain are allowed to change their strengths. Here you need the sign of the error signal to tell the connections which direction to change in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the brain doesn’t necessarily want each and every bit of feedback it gets to change a connection between neurons. For that locks it into a path from which it might be difficult to recover. Indeed, when we try and change the strengths of these connections ourselves, by stimulating the inputs to a neuron, some of them can prove remarkably difficult to shift. Which raises the possibility that, in the short-term, the brain may want to hedge its bets, by changing its estimates of an action’s value without changing any connection strengths. And it can do this by instead changing how responsive neurons are to their inputs. If you make the neuron for action A more likely to fire, then you’ve increased its predicted value; and vice-versa. Guess which transmitter in the brain has many hundreds of papers showing it changes the responsiveness of neurons that control action? Yep, dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put together, the argument here is that the explicit error signal exists to allow the brain to control changes of predicted value on two time-scales. And do that using one error signal coded by dopamine: to both allow changing connection strengths in the long-term, and change how responsive neurons are in the short-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third idea is that an explicit error signal in the brain is evolutionary happenstance. Building a system to learn from feedback is easier with an explicit error signal than with representations of probabilities across a group of neurons. Ancient animals likely had a neuron or two that spritzes dopamine, or something similar, as part of their control of movement. We can find plenty of invertebrates with a just a few thousand neurons in which &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0136-08.2008&quot;&gt;dopamine alters movement &lt;/a&gt;by changing the ways neurons respond to their inputs. With this dopamine system in place, perhaps the path of least resistance for evolution was to co-opt this broadcast signal to change the coupling between neurons following an error. Which seems potentially easier than, from the same crude beginnings, first evolving a distributed system for representing information that does not require an explicit error signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contributions of theory to neuroscience are as much about showing what the brain doesn’t or can’t do, as what it can do. Yes, if we allow any arbitrary idea, this space is practically infinite: theories showing that the brain doesn’t use strawberry jelly as a neurotransmitter, or doesn’t compute using the back of an envelope and a blunt pencil are not useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here we find an explicit error signal in the brain, and that rules out a whole class of ways of doing learning from feedback, and rules some in. The reward prediction error theory of dopamine tells us as much by what it doesn’t do, as what does. In the garden of forking paths, we should be glad of some help — and few garden paths are more forking complicated than the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want more?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jessesingal.com/&quot;&gt;Jesse Singal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There are few subjects where a larger gap exists between public opinion and expert opinion than people’s views on foods, like corn or wheat, that have been genetically manipulated to, for example, increase crop yields or bolster pest-resistance. Experts generally view so-called GM foods as totally safe to consume, while the public is suspicious of them — and this divide is massive. One &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/11/amid-debate-over-labeling-gm-foods-most-americans-believe-theyre-unsafe/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Pew Research Center survey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; found that just 37 per cent of the American public believed GM foods are safe to eat, compared with 88 per cent of members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (public attitudes are similarly negative in the UK, with a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2014/02/21/many-britain-remain-sceptical-gm-foods&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;2014 poll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; finding that 40 per cent of adults felt the government should not promote GM foods, compared with 22 per cent in favour, and the rest unsure). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Unlike some subjects where this divide between layperson and expert opinion is heavily mediated by politics, such as climate change caused by human activity — in the U.S. and elsewhere, conservatives are far less likely to believe in it than are liberals and climate scientists — the GM-food divide doesn’t really have a political dimension: Liberals, centrists, and conservatives are all about equally likely to have what are, from the point of view of experts, unfounded fears about the safety of GM foods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To better understand the source of these fears, a team led by Philip M. Fernbach, a professor at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder, surveyed nationally representative samples in America, Germany and France, and other online participants, about their views on both GM foods and climate change, tested their knowledge on these subjects by asking them to answer factual questions, and also asked them to gauge their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;perceived&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; level of knowledge on those subjects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The headline finding from the study, published as a letter in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, is neatly summed up by its title: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0520-3&quot;&gt;“Extreme opponents of genetically modified foods know the least but think they know the most.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; That is, on average, the more vehemently a given respondent said they were opposed to GM foods, the fewer questions about the subject they answered accurately, and the higher they rated their own knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36339&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This can be seen as a subject-specific version of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123855220000056&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dunning-Kruger effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, or people’s tendency to be ignorant about their own ignorance. The finding held across the samples in different countries (though in France, the zoomed-out finding that supporters of GM foods knew more about the subject than opponents wasn’t statistically significant, as it was elsewhere):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; data-shortcode=&quot;caption&quot; id=&quot;attachment_36341&quot; style=&quot;width: 2278px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot 2019-02-07 17.09.03.png&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-36341&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;36341&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Screenshot 2019-02-07 17.09.03&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/screenshot-2019-02-07-17.09.03.png?w=845?w=845&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/screenshot-2019-02-07-17.09.03.png?w=845?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/screenshot-2019-02-07-17.09.03.png?w=845&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;2278,1302&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/11/people-who-are-most-fearful-of-genetically-modified-foods-think-they-know-the-most-about-them-but-actually-know-the-least/screenshot-2019-02-07-17-09-03/&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/screenshot-2019-02-07-17.09.03.png?w=845&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0520-3&quot;&gt;Fernbach et al, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;These are dispiriting findings. The people who know the least think they know the most, and suffice it to say some of them are likely taking an active part in spreading overblown fears about GM foods, worsening the problem. (One possible explanation for the results is that people with the strongest opposition to GM foods are concerned about matters unrelated to scientific knowledge, such as being opposed for moral reasons. However, the researchers looked into this and found that “73% of respondents cited food safety/health concerns as their reason for opposition…Extreme opponents were actually more likely to cite food safety/health concerns than moderates and the main results replicate when we restrict analysis to the subset of participants citing food safety/health concerns.”)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Things get even more interesting upon examining Fernbach et al’s findings with regard to anthropogenic climate change, knowledge, and perceived knowledge. Because there, while the researchers found the same general pattern, it wasn’t statistically significant: “Contrary to GM foods and gene therapy we found no significant effects of knowledge—objective or self-assessed—on extremity of climate change attitudes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Why might that be? The researchers think it’s because climate change has become politicised whereas GM foods have not. “The null effect [for climate change] has been attributed to ‘cultural cognition,’” the authors write, referring to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.culturalcognition.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;concept most commonly associated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://law.yale.edu/dan-m-kahan&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Dan Kahan of Yale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. “When an issue becomes polarized, people’s attitudes reflect affiliation with their ideological group and not individual knowledge. That is, individuals subscribe to whatever their in-group believes, regardless of how much they know about the issue.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Moreover, on this and other politicised topics, extreme ideology might sap people’s ability to truly integrate new information, and recognise the merit of counter-arguments, in a manner that nudges their beliefs. While the “traditional view in the public understanding of scientific literature is that public attitudes that run counter to the scientific consensus reflect a knowledge deficit,” in reality this view, itself, appears to be inaccurate, at least when it comes to politically charged issues: As people get more knowledgeable, their beliefs on such controversies &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;don’t &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;necessarily change in the predictable manner one would expect if there were a direct tie between knowledge and belief unmediated by ideology. That might be because strong ideological beliefs cause people to simply filter and interpret new information in a manner which reinforces those beliefs. “Okay, based on this research it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;does &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;look like the planet is warming, but that’s part of a natural cycle that has nothing to do with humans.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As Fernbach and his colleagues note at the end of their paper, even for less-politicised issues like GM foods, their findings suggest that improving public awareness of basic scientific consequences might be more complex than previously realised, since those holding onto the most severe forms of misinformation are also least likely to seek out more facts or be open to hearing the other side. “This suggests that a prerequisite to changing people’s views through education may be getting them to first appreciate the gaps in their knowledge.” Which is a whole other task — and a very important one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0520-3&quot;&gt;Extreme opponents of genetically modified foods know the least but think they know the most&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We welcome Plan S as a ‘decisive step towards the realisation of full open access’&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, in particular the push it provides towards realization of a research process based on the principles of open science. This is fully aligned with our mission to bring scientists together to share work as rapidly and widely as possible, to advance science faster and to benefit society as a whole. Our publications have operated in line with the core principles outlined in Plan S since the launch of our first journal, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;, in 2003. We recognize that wide adoption of support for Plan S may bring additional competition within the open access publishing space. We welcome this evolution as a positive change in research culture, resulting in greater availability of information, growing inclusion in the scientific process and increasing the speed of discovery and innovation.  Below is our response to the call for public feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Feedback Questions &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt; Is there anything unclear or are there any issues that have not been addressed by the guidance document?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;While welcoming Plan S, its principles and stated intentions, there are some points where we believe additional clarification would be beneficial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A. Changing research assessment&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are glad to see emphasis on changing research assessment and commitment to the principles of DORA as part of Plan S. We believe this is critical to enabling change in publication behaviours, allowing the value of research outputs to be assessed on their merits rather than through an aggregated metric based on publication venue. However, we note that although the original publication of Plan S states that members of cOalition S ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;commit to fundamentally revise the incentive and reward system of science, using the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) as a starting point’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, the implementation guidance states only that ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;cOAlition S members intend to sign DORA and implement those requirements in their policies.’ We ask cOalition S to provide clarity regarding the steps that will be taken to drive the ‘fundamental change’ indicated in the original publication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;B. Transformative agreements&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;While recognizing the need for a route for subscription journals to transition away from publication behind paywalls, we believe that without stringent guidelines and compliance checks, ‘transformative deals’ may have significant unintended consequences, reducing choice and narrowing the market. As identified by Adam Tickell in his 2015 review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; the need for ‘OA policy to offer greater choice to research producers’ remains, and we believe this should be a primary consideration for cOalition S in considering the future shape of the research and innovation market, particularly as it relates to the assessment and communication of research findings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;‘Transformative agreements’ offer advantage to the largest players and to publishers with substantial subscriptions business, as smaller publishers have to ‘wait in line’ to enter negotiations while those, including but not limited to PLOS, without legacy subscription businesses cannot participate. We acknowledge that the intention of cOalition S members is that ‘transformative agreements’ should not decrease the amount of money available in the system to fund publishing in other compliant venues, however, we believe this is the likely outcome as limited institutional and library publication budgets become tied into large ‘read and publish’/’publish and read’ (RAP/PAR) deals. This perpetuates the dominance of the ‘big deal’ in the market, which in its rebranded ‘publish and read’ form, has the potential to become the status quo rather than a step towards transformation, much as hybrid journals have become the status quo in relation to open access. Moreover, the transition of subscription ‘big deals’ into ‘RAP/PAR’ deals risks locking the high cost of subscriptions into an open access future, if deals so far are anything to judge by. We would like to see a ‘clear and time-specified commitment to a full Open Access transition’ as outlined in the implementation guidelines, be a central requirement for all journals covered by a ‘transformative agreement’ in order to be considered compliant with Plan S. We also ask for greater clarity on the allowed start and end dates for these agreements. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;C. Deposition in open repositories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;While we understand that this is a recommendation rather than a mandatory criterion for compliance with Plan S, we believe that the proposal that there be ‘direct deposition of publications by the publisher into Plan S compliant author designated or centralised Open Access repositories’ has the potential to add cost and complexity to compliance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Currently, we and many other publishers syndicate our published articles to PMC/Europe PMC. The process of direct deposition to each repository is not without cost, requiring both staff and technical resources to set up and to run. These costs will increase should it become necessary to deposit to a range of ‘author designated’ repositories. This is especially the case given the importance of equitable treatment of publications from researchers in different disciplines and/or geographical regions, particularly as cOalition S grows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We encourage cOalition S to reconsider this recommendation and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;propose deposition in a small number of recognized repositories or dispatch services, to facilitate compliance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;D. Publication costs and APC caps&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In the published guidance, cOalition S calls for ‘full transparency and monitoring of Open Access publication costs and fees’ and indicates the potential for ‘standardisation of fees and/or APC caps’. We understand that the cOalition has revised this position and intends to call for transparency but not to introduce set caps. We welcome this change of approach which we would like to see reflected in the next iteration of the written guidance. We believe that requiring transparency will allow funders, or others paying the costs of publication, to assess the value of their payments while minimizing the opportunity to give rise to unintended consequences. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In considering potential unintended consequences, there is a useful parallel with the introduction of tuition fees at universities in England. Since tuition fees were introduced in 1998, they have been capped by the UK government. According to a House of Commons Library briefing paper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, each time that the cap has been raised, almost all English HEIs have increased their fees to the maximum allowed level. When it was announced that the cap would increase to £9,000 from 2012, Lord Willetts, then Minister for Universities and Science, said that the maximum fee would be charged only in ‘exceptional circumstances’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and it was anticipated that this would ‘create a market in fees’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. This market did not emerge and in fact, nearly all HEIs set their fees at the maximum allowed rate. We believe that there is significant potential for an analogous situation to emerge in relation to APCs. Rather than creating a market where publishers set APCs at the lowest level that covers their costs sustainably, it is more likely that caps would encourage APCs to be set at the maximum allowed level even if this is substantially higher than the publisher’s costs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Additionally, the cost associated with the publication of an individual article is highly variable dependent on publication venue. The level of editorial activity, including building relationships with, and providing support to, authors, referees and academic editors is a significant contributor to cost but generates substantial value for the research community. The level of selectivity of the journal or platform is also an influencing factor, as more selective publications incur additional costs through assessing articles that do not go on to be published in that venue. While we recognize and support the need to change the measure of selectivity from one focused on journal impact factors, we believe that the ability to differentiate levels of selectivity based on appropriate and meaningful criteria should continue, where selective  journals and platforms can demonstrate their value through community engagement and cost transparency. We believe that this will support a thriving research and innovation ecosystem more effectively than moving to a ‘one size fits all’ approach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt; Are there other mechanisms or requirements funders should consider to foster full and immediate Open Access of research outputs? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We believe that diversity and equality of opportunity, including for new entrants to the market, should be retained and encouraged to ensure to a thriving and diverse research and innovation ecosystem. Referring to part (B) of our answer to Question 1, we encourage cOalition S to consider this opportunity to move from ‘big deal’-style arrangements as rapidly as possible to avoid further consolidation around the largest players in the market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Focusing on regulation of existing business models, both transformative agreements and APCs, may have the unintended consequence of creating barriers to the diversification in the market. We applaud the the support indicated in the implementation guidance for ‘a diversity of models and non-APC based outlets’ and encourage cOalition S to ensure equal emphasis on the development of new business models, alongside consideration of established approaches. We believe this is vital in order to maintain choice for researchers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 The UK’s Royal Society of Chemistry has retracted a 2017 paper in one of its journals after learning that the authors stole the article from other researchers during peer review. The offending article, “Typical and interstratified arrangements in Zn/Al layered double hydroxides: an experimental and theoretical approach,” appeared in CrystalEngComm, and was written by Priyadarshi … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2019/02/08/chem-journal-yanks-paper-because-authors-had-stolen-it-as-peer-reviewers/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Chem journal yanks paper because authors had stolen it as peer reviewers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling good in an emotional sense helps to foster better physical health – at least that’s what’s been found in studies in the West. But “feeling good” doesn’t necessarily mean the same thing in all cultures. In the US, people tend to report that being excited and experiencing other so-called “high arousal positive (HAP) states” is what makes them feel good. Many people in Japan, however, place greater value on the opposite extreme, viewing calm, quiet “low arousal positive (LAP) states” as more pleasant and desirable. So, does this mean that engaging more often in stimulating activities – like a fitness work-out or a party – will make for better health in US citizens, while for people in Japan, engaging in more calming activities – like taking frequent baths – will have more of a beneficial effect? A &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-03288-001.pdf&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Emotion&lt;/i&gt;, which explores this question, reveals some clear cultural variations – though not all of them are as the researchers predicted. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36337&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magali Clobert at Stanford University and her colleagues analysed survey data collected at two time points from 640 Americans and 382 Japanese people. The sample from the US was slightly more educated and slightly older than the Japanese, but as the authors note, “both samples come from an industrialized and modern society, are well-educated, and are middle-aged.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at the participants’ initial scores on a variety of surveys measuring their experience of HAP and LAP emotional states, as well as how often the participants engaged in behaviours or practices that could feasibly generate these states, such as going to a party, having a good fitness work-out or amusing people (all of which should lead to HAP feelings) and reading, taking a relaxing bath, praying, meditating or seeing beautiful scenery (which should lead to LAP feelings). They also reported on how psychologically and physically well they felt. Clobert and her colleagues then looked at biological data (including blood cholesterol levels, body mass index, and the inflammatory marker IL-6), which had been collected several months later. At this second time point, the participants also gave ratings for aspects of life satisfaction, sleep, subjective physical health, HAP and LAP behaviours, and psychological wellbeing.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that HAP feelings predicted better physical health more in the United States than they did in Japan. For example, experiencing more HAP feelings at the first time point predicted both a subsequently lower BMI and lower inflammation in the US – but not in Japan. Engaging in more HAP-related activities also predicted fewer later ill-health symptoms and conditions, fewer sleep problems and less pain in the US – but not in Japan. “Among Japanese, HAP feelings did not predict most of the health outcomes, and this was particularly evident for biological and physical health,” the researchers note.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also consistent with the researchers’ predictions, engaging in more LAP-related behaviours was associated with subsequent better health for people in Japan more than in the US – such as fewer sleep problems and less pain. However, against expectations, experiencing more LAP feelings was actually a stronger predictor of better psychological well-being in the US than in Japan (though paradoxically more LAP feelings also marginally predicted greater inflammation in the US participants).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers titled their paper: &lt;i&gt;‘Feeling excited or taking a bath: do distinct pathways underlie the positive affect-health link in the US and Japan?&lt;/i&gt;’ As they themselves note, their work suggests that the answer is “a partial ‘yes’” – the findings suggest that cultural attitudes to what is and is not a desirable emotional state, and related behaviours, can influence health, and deserve more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clobert and her colleagues conclude, “Positive feelings may be more beneficial to health in cultural contexts that value those states, especially for feeling HAP states. By comparing cultures that differ systematically in terms of how they understand, value, and construe emotion, we may be able to determine why positive affect is so important for health in many U.S. settings, and determine to what extent positive affect matters for physical, biological, and mental functioning in other settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/emo0000531&quot;&gt;Feeling excited or taking a bath: Do distinct pathways underlie the positive affect–health link in the U.S. and Japan?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How accurately or not we are able to judge the size of our own bodies and specific body parts is an important topic in clinical psychology because a distorted body image is thought to play part in eating disorders, body dysmorphia and other related conditions. However, research has until now been limited in always involving one- or two-dimensional judgments, with volunteers asked to estimated the length of various body parts, for instance, or asked to judge which of various 2-dimensional visual depictions of their body is most accurate. In reality, of course, we don’t just have a sense of how our body looks in two dimensions from the outside but also how it feels from the inside, including how much space it occupies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945218303496?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Cortex&lt;/em&gt; is the first to examine how accurately people of healthy weight can estimate the volume of their entire body and specific body parts. Renata Sadibolova at Goldsmiths, University of London, and her colleagues write that “these findings … highlight the importance of studying the perceptual distortions ‘at the baseline’, i.e., in healthy population, given their potential to further elucidate the nature of perceptual distortions in clinical conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36307&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 40 young men and women (average BMI 24) and asked them to wear a black smock to cover their bodies and to sit at a table. Here they were challenged to judge their bodies in one of two different ways. Half the participants made judgments of the length and volume of various parts of their body based on using their sense of the length and volume of their hand, such as estimating how many hand-lengths is their foot, their head, right arm, right leg, and entire body; and how many times could their hand hypothetically fit inside of those same body parts (thus giving an estimate of their sense of the volume of those parts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other half the participants made the same judgements but used as a reference a book (wrapped in brown paper to hide irrelevant details) and stick, chosen by the researchers to as closely as possible match the actual volume and length of each participant’s hand as determined using a water displacement technique. Participants in this group had to estimate how long their body parts (foot, head, arm, leg, torso, entire body) were in reference to the stick length, and to estimate the volume of those same parts using the bulk of the book as a reference point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also went to great trouble to estimate the true length and volume of the participants’ various body parts. This included using water displacement techniques and tape measures to record the length and circumference of various body parts, and then – guided by research on the proportional dimensions of cadavers – extrapolating from these measures to obtain estimates of volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the results revealed an intriguing picture in which participants tended to &lt;em&gt;overestimate&lt;/em&gt; the length of their various body parts, but to &lt;em&gt;underestimate&lt;/em&gt; their volume. Moreover, there was an apparent association with the surface area of body parts, such that the distortion (whether underestimation of volume or overestimation of length) was greater for parts with less surface area. These distortions may partly arise, the researchers suggested, because we are much less aware of signals arising from within the body compared from signals from the outside, thus leading our volume and length judgments to be skewed in contrasting ways by the amount of outward-facing skin on a given body part (an overcompensation in the case of length, and a lack of compensation for volume).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The patterns of misperception across body parts thus gave rise to proportionally distorted body shapes, that are similar to a well-known depiction of a somatosensory homunculus and a tall bean-pole respectively,” the researchers said (see images above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that there were some judgment differences based on whether the participants used their hand size as a reference point or the objects (the book or the stick), with some of the length overestimates being greater for those who used their hand as a unit of measurement. However, the general pattern of results was the same regardless of the measurement reference used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers concluded “Our findings add to a growing evidence that healthy adults do not have a ‘highly accurate–if not infallible’ representation of their body size as previously assumed, and that their perceptual errors may be determined by the role of body parts in external signal processing.”&lt;/p&gt;

 Now here's a paper with an interesting title: The dark matter of the brain



Author Saak V. Ovsepian argues that &quot;the great majority of nerve cells in the intact brain do not fire action potentials, i.e., are permanently silent.&quot; This is a remarkable claim, and it raises the question of what these silent neurons are doing. However, I didn't find myself convinced of the existence of this 'dark matter'.

&lt;p&gt;Cephalopods are very much unlike the familiar model organisms of mammalian neuroscience; yet they are emerging as a promising model organism in comparative neurobiology and in bio-inspired robotics. This talk will start with a general overview of cephalopod brains and behaviour. We will then focus on learning in the vertical lobe and compare it with the mushroom body of insects.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="fr-FR">
 &lt;p&gt;What is a metaphor? Essentially, a metaphor is an analogy that doesn’t say its name. We use metaphors all the time without even noticing it, as was beautifully demonstrated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By&quot;&gt;Lakoff &amp;amp; Johnson (1980)&lt;/a&gt;. When I say for example, “let me cast some light on this issue”, I am using a fairly sophisticated metaphor in which I make an analogy between understanding and seeing. In that analogy, an explanation allows you to understand, in the same way as light allows you to see. You might then reply: I &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; what you mean, it is &lt;em&gt;clearer&lt;/em&gt;! Chances are that, in normal conversation, we would not have noticed that we both used a metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metaphors are everywhere in neuroscience, and in biology more generally (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/category/blog/metaphors/&quot;&gt;these posts&lt;/a&gt;). For example: &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxvi-is-optimization-a-good-metaphor-of-evolution/&quot;&gt;evolution optimizes&lt;/a&gt; traits (see the excellent article of &lt;a href=&quot;https://faculty.washington.edu/lynnhank/GouldLewontin.pdf&quot;&gt;Gould &amp;amp; Lewontin (1979)&lt;/a&gt; for a counterpoint); &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/is-the-coding-metaphor-relevant-for-the-genome/&quot;&gt;the genome is a code for the organism&lt;/a&gt; (see Denis Noble (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3060581/&quot;&gt;2011a&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsfs.2011.0067&quot;&gt;2011b&lt;/a&gt;)); the &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxx-is-the-brain-a-computer/&quot;&gt;brain runs algorithms&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxiv-is-the-brain-a-computer-2/&quot;&gt;is a computer&lt;/a&gt; (see also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cisek.org/pavel/Pubs/Cis1999.pdf&quot;&gt;Paul Cisek&lt;/a&gt; (1999) or &lt;a href=&quot;http://fredericjoignot.blogspirit.com/archive/2006/06/23/francisco-varela-neurobiologiste-et-bouddhiste.html&quot;&gt;Francisco Varela&lt;/a&gt;); &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/168237&quot;&gt;neural activity is a code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These metaphors are so ingrained in neuroscientific thinking that many object to the very idea that they are metaphorical. The objection is that “evolution is optimization” or “brain runs algorithms” is not a metaphor, it is a &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt;. Or, for the more dogmatic, these are not metaphors, these are &lt;em&gt;facts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indisputable truths belong to theology, not science, so any claim that a general proposition is a &lt;em&gt;fact&lt;/em&gt; should be seen as suspect – it is an expression of dogmatism. But there is a case that we are actually talking about theories. In the case of neural codes or brains as computers, one might insist that the terms “code” or “computer” refer to abstract properties, not to concrete objects like a desktop computer. But this is a misunderstanding of what a metaphor, or more generally an analogy, is. When I am “casting light on this issue”, I am not referring to any particular lamp, but to an abstract concept of light which does not actually involve photons. The question is not whether words are actually some sort of photons, but whether the functional relation between light and seeing is similar to the functional relation between explanation and understanding. There is no doubt that these concepts are abstracted from actual properties of concrete situations (of light and perception), but so are the concepts of code and computer. In the metaphor, it is the abstract properties that are at stake, so the objection “it is not a metaphor, it is a theory” either misunderstands what metaphor is (a metaphor &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a theory), or perhaps really means “the theory is correct” – again dogmatism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the mathematically minded, a mathematical concept that captures this idea is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphism&quot;&gt;morphism&lt;/a&gt;”. A morphism is a map that preserves structure. For example, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_homomorphism&quot;&gt;group homomorphism&lt;/a&gt; f from X to Y is such that f(a*b) = f(a) x f(b): the operation * defined on X is mapped to the operation x defined on Y (of course “metaphors are morphisms” is a metaphor!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the “let me cast light on this issue” metaphor, I am mapping the domain of visual perception to the domain of linguistic discourse: light -&amp;gt; words; visual object -&amp;gt; issue ; seeing -&amp;gt; understanding. What makes the metaphor interesting is that some relations within the first domain are mapped to relations in the other domain: use of light on an object causes seeing; use of words on an issue causes understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example in science is the analogy between the heart and a pump. Each element of the pump (e.g. valve, liquid) is mapped to an element of the heart, and the analogy is relevant because functional relations between elements of the pump are mapped to corresponding relations between elements of the heart. Thus, the analogy has explanatory power. What makes a metaphor or an analogy interesting is not the fact that the two domains are similar (they are generally not), but the richness of the structure preserved by the implied morphism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, a metaphor or an analogy is a theory that takes inspiration from another domain (e.g. computer science), by mapping some structure from one domain to the other. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this, on the contrary. Why then is the term “metaphor” so vehemently opposed in science ? Because the term implies that the theory is questionable (hence, again, dogmatism). There are ways in which understanding is like seeing, but there are also ways in which it is different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us consider the metaphor “the brain implements algorithms”, &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxx-is-the-brain-a-computer/&quot;&gt;which I previously discussed&lt;/a&gt;. Some are irritated by the very suggestion that &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/yes-the-brain-is-a-computer-11f630cad736&quot;&gt;this might even be a metaphor&lt;/a&gt;. The rhetorical strategy is generally two-fold: 1) by “algorithm”, we mean some abstract property, not programs written in C++; 2) the definition of “algorithm” is made general enough that it is trivially true, in which case it is not a metaphor since it is literally true. As argued, (1) is a misunderstanding of linguistics because metaphor &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; about abstract properties. And if we follow (2), then nothing can be inferred from the statement. Thus, it is only to the extent that “the brain implements algorithms” is metaphorical that it is insightful (and it is to some extent, but in my view to a limited extent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key question, thus, is what we mean by “algorithm”. A natural starting point would be to take the definition from a computer science textbook. The most used textbook on the subject is probably Cormen et al., &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition&quot;&gt;Introduction to algorithms&lt;/a&gt;. It proposes the following definition: “&lt;em&gt;a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output&lt;/em&gt;”. One would need to define what “computational” means in this context, but it is not key for this discussion. With this definition, to say that the brain implements an algorithm means that there exists a morphism between brain activity and a sequence of computational steps. That is, intermediate values of the algorithm are mapped to properties of brain activity (e.g. firing rates measured over some time window) - this is the “encoding”. Then we claim that this mapping has the property that a computational step linking two values is mapped to the operation of the dynamics of the brain linking the two corresponding neural measurements. I explain in the third part of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/168237&quot;&gt;essay on neural coding&lt;/a&gt; why this claim cannot be correct, at least not generally and only approximately (one reason is that a measurement of neural activity must be done on some time window, and thus cannot be considered as an initial state of a dynamical system, from which you could deduce the future dynamics). But this is not the point of this discussion. The point is that this claim, that there is a morphism between an algorithm and brain activity, is not trivial and it has explanatory value. In other words, it is interesting. This stems from the rich structure that is being mapped between the two domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it is not trivial (as in fact any metaphor), a discussion will necessarily arise about whether and to what extent the implied mapping does in fact preserve structure between the two domains. You could accept this state of affairs and provide empirical or theoretical arguments. Or you could dismiss the metaphorical nature entirely. But by doing so, you are also dismissing what is interesting about the metaphor, that is, the fact that there might be a morphism between two domains. We could for example redefine “algorithm” in a more general way as a computable function, even if it is not what is usually meant by that (as the Cormen textbook shows). But in that case, the claim loses all explanatory value because no structure at all is transported between the two domains. We are just calling sensory signals “input” and motor commands “output” and whatever happens in between “algorithm”. In mathematical terms, this is a mapping but not a morphism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, metaphors are interesting because they are morphisms between domains, which is what gives them scientific value (they are models). The problem, however, is that metaphor is typically covert, and failure to recognize them as such leads to dogmatism. When one objects to the use of some words like “code”, “algorithm”, “representation”, “optimization”, a common reaction is that the issue “is just semantic”. What this means is that it is just about arbitrary labels, and the labels themselves do not really matter. As if scientific discourse were essentially uninteresting and trivial (we just observe things and give them names). This reaction reveals a naïve view of language where words are mappings (between objects and arbitrary labels), when what matters is the structured concepts that words refer to through morphisms, not just mappings. This is what metaphor is about.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Colourful selection of fruit and beverages&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/smoothies-2253423_960_720-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnutr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40795-018-0223-1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a break to avoid a snack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive sedentary time has been identified as a contributing factor to cardiovascular disease, but sedentary behavior is nevertheless becoming more common in the workplace. Alongside the adverse health effects associated with sedentary behavior, prolonged sitting also provides opportunity to snack, and subsequently the consumption of junk food is also linked to an increased chance of cardiovascular disease. Although sedentary behavior and diet are separate life style concerns, interventions addressing poor diet are often combined with interventions that address physical activity. Much is already known about combined interventions that address overall diet and physical activity, but much less is known about combined interventions that tackle both diet and sedentary behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10787&quot; style=&quot;width: 319px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Snacking at work&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10787 &quot; height=&quot;206&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/coffee-3253354_960_720-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;309&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study by Casey &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; investigates whether reduction of sedentary behavior leads to an alteration in caloric intake. To test this, participants were split up into one group of women having two 15 minute breaks a day, and another group of women having 1-2 minute breaks every half hour. The results of the study suggest that, overall, taking breaks during sedentary time at work reduces caloric intake over time. The researchers suggest that sedentary breaks should be further explored as a means to improve health outcomes for women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weight loss and eating-related concerns are commonly reported symptoms in advanced cancer patients and survivors. Despite its prevalence, there are no effective interventions to assess or improve food related quality of life for these individuals. Most studies related to this topic assess eating-related difficulties during treatment, but fail to address long term impacts of the ability to “eat well.” Additionally, studies that investigate eating-related difficulties usually focus on the functional aspect of eating, whilst the social and emotional aspects tend to be ignored. Aiming to improve of the food-related quality of life of cancer survivors, the authors consider a more holistic approach to “altered eating”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t join in the conversation with anybody else … because I can’t control the food in my mouth and I need to concentrate so hard on what I’m doing, you’re not part of the social group anyway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to assess and address the altered eating related difficulties experienced by cancer survivors, Watson &lt;em&gt;et al &lt;/em&gt;worked alongside 25 head and neck cancer survivors and their partners. Over the course of 6 years, their workshops identified seven areas of life that affect or are affected by altered eating. These areas include not only anatomical, functional, and sensory alterations, but also the cognitive and behavioral labor of eating, as well as the alterations in social life and identity. As part of their study, the authors have developed a framework that allows assessment and treatment of altered eating, to improve food-related quality of life in cancer survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnutr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40795-018-0232-0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discrepancies between estimates of wasting measurements for classification of nutrition crisis severity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In areas experiencing widespread malnutrition, the prevalence of wasting found in the community acts as a benchmark to inform humanitarian aides on the scale and scope of the response needed. The current standards used by the World Health Organisation, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, International Federation of Red Cross, and World Food Programme are based on prevalence of wasting criteria as assessed by the weight-for-height Z scores (WHZ). In addition to WHZ, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) can be used as an independent measure of wasting. Although MUAC has become the recommended measure by the World Health Organisation and other public health agencies, there are no separate thresholds to classify crises assessed by MUAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10786&quot; style=&quot;width: 223px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Mother holding malnourished child&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10786&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/25749470-1-200x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;213&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;© dpa (Deutsche Presse-Agentur)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has demonstrated that there is substantial discrepancy in diagnosis of children as wasted using WHZ and MUAC. As a result, the validity of applying WHZ-based thresholds to MUAC-based estimates of wasting has been called into question. In their study, Bilukha and Leidman investigated the concordance of prevalence of wasting by WHZ and MUAC at the population level. The authors report that there is a poor correlation between population prevalence of wasting as measured by WHZ and MUAC.  Furthermore, they assert that surveys based on MUAC measurements will result in poor concordance with WHZ-based crisis thresholds. The data presented in this study suggest that MUAC may not be the best choice to use as a measurement to classify prevalence of wasting at the population level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While psychology has been mired in a “replication crisis” recently – based on the failure of contemporary researchers to recreate some of its most cherished findings – there have been pockets of good news for certain sub-disciplines in the field. For instance, some replication efforts in &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/05/these-nine-cognitive-psychology-findings-all-passed-a-stringent-test-of-their-replicability/&quot;&gt;cognitive psychology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/12/philosophise-this-a-new-project-has-found-that-psychology-research-by-philosophers-is-robust-and-replicates/&quot;&gt;experimental philosophy or X-phi&lt;/a&gt; have been more successful, suggesting that results in these areas are more robust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this more optimistic list we may now add personality psychology, or at least the specific area of research linking the Big Five personality trait scores with various personal and life outcomes, such as higher Neuroticism being associated with poorer mental health and reduced relationship satisfaction; higher trait Conscientiousness being associated with less risk of substance abuse; and stronger Extraversion correlating with leadership roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his new paper that is in press at &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/k436d/&quot;&gt;available as a preprint&lt;/a&gt; at the Open Science Framework), Christopher Soto at Colby College speculates that perhaps it is the tendency for researchers in personality to use large samples of participants, numbering in the hundreds or thousands, and to use reliable, standardised tests, that is to some extent responsible for the relatively robust results in this area. The new findings “leave us cautiously optimistic about the current state and future prospects of the personality-outcome literature,” Soto writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-36304&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soto sourced 78 previously published trait-outcome associations from a major review published in 2006 “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190127&quot;&gt;Personality and the Prediction of Consequential Outcomes&lt;/a&gt;“. To see if these effects replicated, he recruited four online samples totalling over 6,000 younger and older participants, and asked them to complete an established 60-item measure of the Big Five personality traits, and then to complete various measures of other life outcomes, covering everything from career to relationship success, to political orientation to criminality (to manage the length of the new surveys some of these were abridged versions of the measures used in the original research).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority (around 87 per cent) of the previously published trait-outcome associations replicated. This is not a perfect result, obviously, but it is far more impressive than the average 36 per cent replication rate &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/&quot;&gt;achieved in 2015 by the Reproducibility Project’s attempt&lt;/a&gt; to replicate findings across social and cognitive psychology, and the less than 50 per cent success rate reported late last year by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/30/its-getting-increasingly-difficult-for-replication-crisis-sceptics-to-explain-away-failed-replications/&quot;&gt;Many Labs 2&lt;/a&gt; project after its attempt to replicate various social psychology findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of original trait-outcome effects that did not replicate this time included lower Agreeableness not correlating with heart disease and higher Conscientiousness not correlating with greater family satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the overall impressive replication success rate, between 63 to 71 per cent of the time the replicated effects were weaker than in the original research, and between 30 to 42 per cent of the time the replicated effect was substantially weaker (the precise figures depended on whether the analyses corrected for the use of abridged outcome measures). This indicates that the existing trait-outcome literature contains at least some false-positive results (i.e. null findings erroneously reported as positive). Overall, the new personality trait-outcome associations were about 80 per cent as large as in the original research. On a positive note, the weakening of significant effect sizes seen here is not as dramatic as in the Reproducibility Project in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original results with a larger effect size replicated more often, and it helped if the replication had more statistical power and if it used the same data source and format (for example, if both the original and the replication used self-report questionnaires). The bigger picture, though, is that most results did replicate even though the new research was obviously conducted in a different era (some of the original results date as far back as the 1980s), sometimes in a different geographical locale, and using a different personality measure. This echoes the message from the recent Many Labs 2 Project that found that those psychology results that do replicate tend to be relatively robust in the face of such contextual differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soto’s new replication effort, dubbed “the Life Outcomes Of Personality Replication (LOOPR) project”, meets the highest research standards, with its methods and hypotheses being pre-registered (to avoid the possibility for post-hoc data tweaking and mining) and with all the materials and data made available online at the Open Science Framework. However, as Soto acknowledges, the study is not perfect – for instance, it involved a cross-sectional design with trait scores and life outcomes measured at the same time point, whereas it is advantageous to use a longitudinal design with outcomes measured later; and only a single replication attempt was made for each trait-outcome finding, whereas in future it may be revealing for multiple attempts of the same findings to be attempted, allowing for the influence of moderating contextual factors to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, this is surely a welcome news story for the field of personality psychology.  Soto is cautiously upbeat in his conclusion, writing that: “… the extant literature provides a reasonably accurate map of how the Big Five personality traits relate with consequential life outcomes, but that personality psychology still stands to gain from ongoing efforts to improve the replicability of behavioral science.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Neonatology ward&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/people-3200398_960_720-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-018-1135-6&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parental perspectives on school food allergy policies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States of America, approximately 6 million children suffer from IgE-mediated food allergies. Although fatalities from food-related allergic reactions at schools are low, approximately 18% of allergic children have experienced an allergic reaction whilst at school, and 10% of schools have reported at least one anaphylactic event during the 2013-2014 school year. The United States Department of Education has not yet established food allergy policy recommendations in order to avoid such events, and the current management of food allergies at schools is primarily based on strict avoidance of known food allergens and after-the-fact responses to accidental exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10779&quot; style=&quot;width: 342px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;School lunch&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10779&quot; height=&quot;221&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/kindergarten-2456159_960_720-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;332&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafa &lt;em&gt;et al &lt;/em&gt;investigated the parental perspectives of school food allergy policies via a survey, to determine what prevention and response measures parents are aware of, their effectiveness, and the additional food allergy policy needs as perceived by parents. Their study reports that most schools have at least one food allergy policy in place, but parents are still concerned about the safety of their child in school settings. The areas of focus for policy improvement include the availability of epinephrine stocks, improved allergen labeling at schools, increased food allergy education, and an improvement in communication between schools and parents about the policies that are already in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-018-1107-x&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat soluble vitamin deficiencies in children diagnosed with Celiac disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celiac disease is an auto-immune condition that is triggered when those affected consume food products containing gluten. This immune reaction damages the surface of the small bowel, which leads to malabsorption and mineral deficiencies. Two commonly known vitamin deficiencies in those affected by Celiac disease are the fat soluble vitamins D and K. Deficiencies in these vitamins often lead to osteoporosis, hyperparathyroidism and hemostasis disorders. Although adults diagnosed with Celiac disease are routinely screened for fat soluble vitamin levels, there is no routine evaluation for pediatric patients. In their paper, Tokgöz &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; investigate the need for such a routine in young patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;there is no agreement on vitamin supplement application or the routine evaluation of fat soluble vitamins in patients diagnosed at a young age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their results showed that vitamin A and D levels of pediatric Celiac disease patients were significantly lower than those found in the control group, and the majority of patients suffered from an insufficiency or a deficiency for these vitamins. However, no vitamin E or vitamin K1 deficiencies were determined in pediatric Celiac disease patients. Following these outcomes the authors suggest that routine evaluation of vitamin A and vitamin D levels may be beneficial for children diagnosed with Celiac disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-018-1089-8&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying mechanisms and contexts of successful participation programs for children and youth with disabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participation in activities and settings that provide challenge, social engagement, belonging, and autonomy is an essential part of child health. However, children and youth living with disabilities experience significant participation restrictions, especially when physical activities are involved. While there is clearly a need to develop successful interventions that promote participation in physical activities for these youngsters, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms and processes that enable a change in children’s participation outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10780&quot; style=&quot;width: 289px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Child in wheelchair playing with peers&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10780&quot; height=&quot;209&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/wheelchair-538138_960_720-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;279&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rehabilitation center &lt;em&gt;Beitostolen Health Sport Centre&lt;/em&gt; (BHC) in Norway runs a Local Environment Model intervention that seeks to enable lifelong activity and participation for people with disabilities. Outcomes observed from this program indicate that physical activity participation may act as a catalyst to promote meaningful responses across all levels of the International Classification of Functioning, disability and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their paper, Waterfield &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; systematically review how and why the pediatric program at BHC works. They provide new knowledge on the mechanisms and contexts that may enable participation in activity for children and youth with disabilities, which may be of particular value for policy makers, researchers and health professionals involved in the development of pediatric disability interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-018-1349-7&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnostic tool to identify young infants with invasive bacterial infections in the emergency department&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom currently follows the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) standards of practice when it comes to treating young febrile infants. As this group of pediatric patients is considered at high-risk of invasive bacterial infections, they are frequently treated with parenteral antibiotics. In order to balance the risk of serious bacterial infections in young infants with prevention of the spread of multi-drug resistant bacteria, tests are being developed to identify young infants with very low risk infections, from whom antibiotic treatment can safely be withheld, and young infants with high-risk infections, which require urgent parenteral antibiotic treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NICE guidance appropriately advocates a low threshold for parental antibiotics with the acceptance that some children will be treated unnecessarily&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such test is a point-of-care test (POCT) for the biomarker procalcitonin. This biomarker is a precursor for the hormone calcitonin, and is usually present at very low levels in the blood of healthy individuals. However, the blood levels of procalcitonin are significantly higher in patients that suffer from sepsis or septic shock, and therefore has the potential to act as a biomarker for invasive bacterial infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their study, Waterfield &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; assessed the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for procalcitonin in identifying young infants with invasive and non-invasive bacterial infections. The researchers conclude in their report that this tool demonstrates excellent diagnostic accuracy for identifying young infants with invasive infections. A tool such as this may be crucial for the improvement of early recognition of serious bacterial infection in very young pediatric patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-018-1300-y&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procedural pain in children as perceived by their caregivers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatric patients in emergency departments, hospitals, and ambulatory settings frequently suffer multiple painful procedures. Evidence-based pharmacological and psychological interventions are available to manage and reduce pain, but they are under-utilized or used inconsistently. The lack of sufficient pain management in children may lead to short-term side effects such as anxiety, avoidance behavior, and somatic symptoms. Additionally, in the long-term, it may increase sensitivity to pain, fear, and health care avoidance later in life. Furthermore, the pain suffered by pediatric patients often results in parental or caregiver distress and anxiety during their child’s procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimizing the management of pediatric pain has been highlighted as a key healthcare priority by the World Health Organisation. Among the most common painful procedures are venepuncture and intravenous insertions. In their study, Willis &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; have identified information needs for caregivers whose children are subjected to these procedures to develop a knowledge-translation tool that will allow caregivers to understand how they can help to reduce and manage pain. Empowering the caregivers to take on this role is an important step in procedural pain management.&lt;/p&gt;
