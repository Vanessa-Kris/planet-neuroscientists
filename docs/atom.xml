 &lt;p&gt;The Large Hadron Collider’s claim to fame is its ability to unveil elusive subatomic particles. But there’s one class of particle that it had never directly detected, even though it produces them in abundance. Neutrinos, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/century/atom-matter-neutron-nuclear-power-fusion&quot;&gt;minute elementary particles&lt;/a&gt;, interact so little with matter that they sail through the particle accelerator’s massive detectors unnoticed (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/8/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, in a proof-of-concept experiment, &lt;a&gt;the first evidence for &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06197&quot;&gt;neutrino interactions at the LHC&lt;/a&gt; has been spotted, researchers with the FASER collaboration report May 13 at arXiv.org. The technique could open up a window to neutrinos at energies for which the particles’ interactions are poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s the first glimpse of neutrinos produced in a particle collider, a type of particle accelerator that smashes beams of particles together. Physicists have detected neutrinos from particle accelerators by smashing a beam of particles into a stationary target, but not in collisions. Looking for neutrinos in particle collisions allows scientists to probe higher energies, but it also makes the neutrinos more difficult to study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To catch the neutrinos interacting, the researchers used a detector containing films similar to those used in photographic film. When a charged particle passes through a film, it leaves behind a track marking where it’s been. Neutrinos, which have no electric charge, don’t leave tracks in the detector. But when a neutrino interacts with matter inside the detector, it produces a spurt of charged particles that point to a neutrino as their source.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The researchers put their detector in a region that neutrinos pass through as they shoot forward from particle collisions in the LHC’s ATLAS detector. After estimating how many of the detections might be due to other particles that can mimic neutrinos, the researchers report that they caught about six neutrino interactions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The LHC, located near Geneva, has been shut down for upgrades since 2018. The experiment, performed shortly before the shutdown, served as a test run for a future experiment, called FASERν, which will start up when the LHC restarts in 2022. FASERν is expected to detect around 10,000 neutrinos during the next period of LHC operations, from 2022 to 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With FASERν, researchers will measure neutrinos’ cross sections, a measure of how likely the particles are to interact with material. That’s important for being able to perform other measurements on neutrinos. For example, scientists can learn about the production of energetic neutrinos in exploding stars and other cosmic sources by detecting them on Earth. But to determine how prevalent such neutrinos are, scientist need to know how likely those neutrinos are to interact with detectors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cross sections depend on particles’ energies, and at the LHC, “we can study the energy range we haven’t studied,” says particle physicist Tomoko Ariga of Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan, a member of the FASER collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not a surprise to find neutrinos at the LHC. “This isn’t the Earth-shattering result,” says particle physicist Deborah Harris of York University in Toronto and Fermilab in Batavia, Ill., who was not involved with the research.  Instead, it shows that detecting neutrinos at the LHC is possible. “This idea is not totally crazy,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We could all name groups of people who we know to be suffering right now; some in distant countries, some in our own. Research shows that we feel less empathy for people in other countries — and so are less likely to support them by protesting, say, or donating money. Meital Balmas and Eran Halperin at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem now report a factor that can influence this, however: our feelings about the national leader. The pair’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167220987989&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt; suggests that a leader who is perceived as “good” and popular at home elicits more empathy, and even greater tangible help, for their struggling citizens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42281&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across four experiments, participants read fictitious reports about purported leaders in Belgium.  These articles painted the leaders in either a positive or a negative light, focusing on their trustworthiness and warmth (or lack of it), for example. The participants also read about the suffering of Belgian citizens in the wake of a terrorist attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initial studies on Israeli citizens found that when the “prime minister” was described in glowing, rather than negative, terms, participants reported feeling more empathy towards Belgian people, and reported being more willing to help families in distress. A subsequent study found that the perceived popularity of the prime minister was important, however: a PM described as being good and popular boosted empathy, while an unpopular one did not — even if they were described as being good. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team then ran a version of this last study with 304 American adults. The methods were similar, but instead of reading about a terrorist attack, this time participants read about a Belgian teenager who was struggling to cope with the ravages and cost of treatment of his rickets. Repeating the earlier findings, when the country’s prime minister was presented as being popular, the participants exposed to the positive description reported more empathy for the teen and his family than those who’d read the negative report. They also said that they’d be more likely to sign a petition appealing to the Belgian government to help. And, when asked if they’d donate some of their fee for taking part in the study to the teenager and his family, they were more likely to agree.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What should we make of all these findings? “We know that national leaders provide rationale for opinion-building regarding their respective nations and contribute to the stereotyping of their citizens,” the researchers write. And they think this is what explains the results — when we think that a national leader who is a good person is popular, we tend to think that the nation’s people are likely to be good people, too, and we feel more empathy for their distress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The work should have implications for leaders, the researchers think. “In recent decades, not only have national leaders served as main foci of the media coverage of international affairs but nowadays they have followers from all over the world via Twitter,” they write. This puts a “huge responsibility” on their shoulders, they add. “The results of this study show that national leaders are in a position to contribute to better and more empathetic inter-society relations and raise pro-social behaviour around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is an interesting idea. Would people in other countries have felt as much sympathy for the people of Christchurch in the wake of the 2019 shootings, say, if New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern hadn’t seemed like such a good person — and also a popular prime minister? What if she’d more like — well, who? Insert your own least-liked democratically elected leader in that space…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting, though, that of course the country used in this study  —  Belgium — is an open democracy. It might seem reasonable to infer that people who love and elect a “good” person are more likely to be “good” people, too. Unfortunately, of course, a huge amount of human suffering is happening in countries without a democratically elected leader. How that affects our empathy for those citizens is an important question that’s beyond the scope of this study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167220987989&quot;&gt;I Care About Your Plight, But Only If I Like Your Leader: The Effect of National Leaders’ Perceived Personality on Empathy and Pro-Social Behavior Towards Their Citizenry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Aamir Khan will talk about a paper &quot;Study of weak / strong multiplication in gain modulation&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an extension of my previous work on the multiplicative response of
spiking neural networks. In our artificial life platform I evolve a gain
modulated network where there are two Inputs namely d (driving input) and m (
the modulatory input). The network aims for a multiplicative Sigmoidal/gaussian
response modulated by the modulatory input m. The response of the network
exhibits three properties such as 1. Saturation , 2. Non linearity and
3.Multiplicity. The multiplicative capacity of the network varies from strong
to weak in a manner that for some modulatory input there is strong
multiplication and for some there is a weak multiplication, I have
differentiated the response of the network in weak/ strong response. Along with
the classification some further constraints are introduced in the system like
The size of the network tends to be larger i.e 5 nodes, in order to reduce the
size I reward the response of the one interneuron and treat it as the output
node.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-weather-normals-30-years-hottest-record-united-states"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;There’s a new normal for U.S. weather. On May 4, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced an official change to its reference values for temperature and precipitation. Instead of using the average values from 1981 to 2010, NOAA’s new “climate normals” will be the averages from 1991 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This new period is the warmest on record for the country. Compared with the previous 30-year-span, for example, the average temperature across the contiguous United States rose from 11.6° Celsius (52.8° Fahrenheit) to 11.8° C (53.3° F). Some of the largest increases were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/death-valley-hottest-recorded-temperature-earth&quot;&gt;in the South and Southwest&lt;/a&gt; — and that same region also showed a dramatic decrease in precipitation (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/17/20&lt;/em&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hot spots &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NOAA’s new climate normal, the period from 1991 to 2020, shows that average temperatures in the contiguous United States increased across most of the country compared with the averages from 1981 to 2010. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 18px;&quot;&gt;U.S. mean temperature change: 1991–2020 compared with 1981–2010&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;map showing U.S. mean temperature change from 1991–2020 compared with 1981–2010&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099856&quot; height=&quot;536&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/052121_CG_climate_inline-1.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099856&quot;&gt;CISESS, NOAA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The United States and other members of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/new-two-tier-approach-%E2%80%9Cclimate-normals%E2%80%9D&quot;&gt;World Meteorological Organization&lt;/a&gt; are required to update their climate normals every 10 years. These data put daily weather events in historical context and also help track changes in drought conditions, energy use and freeze risks for farmers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That moving window of averages for the United States also tells a stark story about the accelerating pace of climate change. When each 30-year period is compared with the average temperatures from 1901 to 2000, no part of the country is cooler now than it was during the 20th century. And temperatures in large swaths of the country, from the American West to the Northeast, are 1 to 2 degrees Fahrenheit higher.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rising temps &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The average temperatures for 30-year “normal” periods for the contiguous United States show the country getting hotter since 1901. Here, each 30-year period is compared with the average temperature for the entire 20th century. From 1991 to 2020, average temperatures across most of the country were at least 0.6 degrees Celsius (1 degree Fahrenheit) higher than the 20th century average.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 18px;&quot;&gt;U.S. 30-year temperature averages compared with 20th-century average&lt;/h4&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It’s an attractive idea: By playing online problem-solving, matching and other games for a few minutes a day, people can improve such mental abilities as reasoning, verbal skills and memory. But whether these games deliver on those promises is up for debate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For every study that finds &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-training-turns-recall-rookies-memory-masters&quot;&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt;, there’s an equal number of papers that find &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-training-technique-gets-critique&quot;&gt;no evidence&lt;/a&gt;,” says Bobby Stojanoski, a cognitive neuroscientist at Western University in Ontario (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/8/17&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;SN: 5/9/17&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, in perhaps the biggest real-world test of these programs, Stojanoski and colleagues pitted more than 1,000 people who regularly use brain trainers against around 7,500 people who don’t do the mini brain workouts. There was &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxge0000773&quot;&gt;little difference between how both groups performed on a series of tests of their thinking abilities&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that brain training doesn’t live up to its name, the scientists report in the April &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: General&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They put brain training to the test,” says Elizabeth Stine-Morrow, a cognitive aging scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. While the study doesn’t show &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; brain trainers aren’t seeing benefits, it does show there is no link “between the amount of time spent with the brain training programs and cognition,” Stine-Morrow says. “That was pretty cool.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 8,563 volunteers globally through Cambridge Brain Sciences, a Toronto-based company that provides assessments to measure healthy brain function. (While several of the researchers are affiliated with the company, it didn’t receive funding for the study.) Participants filled out an online questionnaire about their training habits, opinions about training benefits and which, if any, program they used. Some 1,009 participants reported using brain training programs for about eight months, on average, though durations ranged from two weeks to more than five years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, the volunteers completed 12 cognitive tests assessing memory, reasoning and verbal skills. They faced Simon-like memory exercises, such spatial reasoning tasks as mentally rotating objects, pattern-finding puzzles and strategy challenges. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers looked at the results, they saw that brain trainers on average had no mental edge over the other group in memory, verbal skills and reasoning. Even among the most dedicated, who had used training programs for at least 18 months, brain training didn’t boost thinking abilities above the level of people who didn’t use the programs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s not because brain trainers have poorer function to start with and then improved. Participants who had trained for less than a month, and presumably wouldn’t have reaped significant benefits from the programs yet, performed on par with people who didn’t train at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“No matter how we sliced the data, we were unable to find any evidence that brain training was associated with cognitive abilities,” says Stojanoski. That held true whether the team analyzed participants by age, program used, education or socioeconomic status – all were cognitively similar to the group who didn’t use the programs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brain training may be beneficial in specific scenarios, Stojanoski says. But “part of our goal was to look at brain training in the real world.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That real world may be the best brain trainer, Stine-Morrow says. While it’s possible to improve mental abilities, Stine-Morrow advocates practicing those skills in different real-life situations. “That’s a much better use of one’s time than sitting at a computer and doing little tasks.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, psychologists and neuroscientists have conducted a large number of studies into the effects of psychedelic drugs. Some have sought to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/16/neural-changes-after-taking-psychedelic-drugs-may-reflect-heightened-consciousness/&quot;&gt;better&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/10/psilocybin-alters-brain-levels-of-the-neurotransmitter-glutamate-and-this-could-explain-why-users-experience-ego-dissolution/&quot;&gt;understand&lt;/a&gt; the effects of the drugs in the brain, while others are investigating the potential for substances like psilocybin and LSD &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00187-9&quot;&gt;to treat depression&lt;/a&gt; and other mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This work obviously require tactful communication on the part of researchers: after all, they don’t want to alienate a public who may be at best ambivalent about the use of currently illegal drugs in research or mental health settings. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963662520981728&quot;&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Public Understanding of Science &lt;/em&gt;highlights one thing researchers &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; do: admit to using psychedelic substances themselves. The team finds that researchers who make such a disclosure may be seen by the public as having less integrity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42252&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, Matthias Forstmann at the University of Zurich and Christina Sagioglou at the University of Innsbruck asked 185 participants to read a vignette about a (fictitious) scientist who studies the use of psychedelics to treat mental health disorders, and who has found some promising results regarding the use of psilocybin. Half read that the professor has “extensive personal experience” with the drugs himself, while the others read that he has no such experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All participants then assessed the professor’s scientific integrity, by rating how well he was described by six adjectives such as “professional” and “credible”. They also evaluated the quality of his research, rating it on adjectives like “valid” and “meaningful”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants who had read that the researcher took the drugs himself rated his integrity significantly lower than those who had read he didn’t use them (this was true regardless of whether the participants themselves had experience taking psychedelics). However, this information didn’t influence people’s judgements about the quality of his research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second study replicated the first, with a greater number of participants and more elaborate descriptions of the professor (for instance, participants saw a mock-up of a paper he had supposedly written). Participants were also asked about the &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; of the findings: whether healthcare providers should cover the costs of using psilocybin, for example. Again, those who read that the professor took psychedelics rated his integrity lower, but the two groups didn’t show any difference in their ratings of the quality or value of the work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are a few possible explanations for these results, the team notes. A researcher who studies psychedelics but also uses them might be seen as having a hidden agenda, for instance. Or perhaps it is the illegal nature of his drug use that makes it seem as though the researcher has less integrity. Further work will be needed to tease out these possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s worth pointing out that the difference in integrity ratings wasn’t huge: in the first study, the non-drug-using professor received an average rating of 5.6 on a seven-point scale, compared to a rating of 5 for the researcher who took drugs. Still, the message of the study seems to be that researchers should consider keeping quiet about any drug use in their personal lives — or at least be aware that what they disclose can influence public perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just what researchers themselves say that’s important, but also the context in which the research is presented. In a final study, participants read about a fictitious scientific conference on psychedelic drugs. All were given the same description of the scientific programme, but some read that various social events were happening which had associations with psychedelic culture (e.g. a shamanic drum circle and a psychedelic art exhibition), while the others read about social events which didn’t have these associations (e.g. a tour of a brewery and a postmodern art exhibition).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this case, the association with psychedelic culture did lower participants’ perceptions of the quality of the research (though, interestingly, only among participants who hadn’t used psychedelic drugs themselves). “In order to positively impact the public’s perception of the quality of psychedelic research, it may be sensible to use less stereotypical imagery and language when talking about these substances, be it in media articles or scientific conferences,” the team concludes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963662520981728&quot;&gt;How psychedelic researchers’ self-admitted substance use and their association with psychedelic culture affect people’s perceptions of their scientific integrity and the quality of their research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/PLOS-Blogs-New-journal-announcment3-1.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It has already been a month since we &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; we’re launching five new journals. For those of you patiently waiting, we are excited to announce that the journals are now OPEN for submissions! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The responses we’ve seen so far have been overwhelmingly positive. We’d like to say a HUGE THANK YOU to those of you who have expressed your support on social media, via email, and the many hundreds of you who have applied to join the editorial boards of the journals–we have been delighted to see how our reasons for launching them have resonated with you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The journals’ websites now contain much more information on each  journal’s mission, scope, personnel, submission instructions and hopefully everything you need to consider submitting your work:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/climate&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Climate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Sustainability and Transformation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/water&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Digital Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Global Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If what you want to do is explore the journal most relevant to you, and consider it for your future work, please consider this blog post an appropriate “jumping off point” for you to do that! In summary: we have affordable, APC-free business models for all our journals available through institutional partnerships which allow unlimited publishing by all authors at the institution. We also have publishing fees/APCs for those who still need or prefer them, and an established APC-waiver program for those who cannot afford APCs but whose institutions are not yet under an institutional agreement. &lt;strong&gt;Please presume there is a way, that is appropriate for you and your context, that you will be able to publish in these new journals!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those of you who want to know more details about our institutional models, in particular librarians and others managing Open Access budgets, please read &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/open-for-submissions-part-2-models/&quot;&gt;Part 2 of this announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Our five new journals are now &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/open-for-submissions-part-1/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open for Submissions&lt;/a&gt;! This post (Part 2) is specifically geared towards librarians and/or those of you who manage budgets that support Open Access publishing. Or, simply those of you who would like more details about how we are supporting our activities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you have been keeping up to date with our business model innovations, you already know we have been working hard to move beyond the APC to develop more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access. In the past eighteen months we’ve developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flat Fee &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;greements&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Community Action Publishing&lt;/a&gt;. (Please see those links for the full details or recap of those models.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re developing new institutional models to experiment and get things right, and we thank all of you in the library community who have given us feedback. We’re learning that, right now, different types of journals can be better supported by different types of institutional models. Also, we’ve learned that some authors, funders, and countries still prefer APCs due to how they are currently funding or administering their OA publishing. We will continue to support such publication fee models for those who prefer or need them, while continuing to experiment with and develop these new institutional models to make OA work for all authors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutional models for the five new journals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Digital Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; joins the group of journals covered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flat Fee agreements&lt;/a&gt; (covering &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Digital Health, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Sustainability and Transformation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has its own &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Community Action Publishing&lt;/a&gt; setup, similar to &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine, &lt;/em&gt;to showcase how CAP can work for new journals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/climate/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Climate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/water/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Global Public Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; offer a new type of institutional business model, which we are naming the “Global Equity” model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Equity &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our new Global Equity model empowers institutions in every region of the world to provide unlimited Open Access publication support for their authors through a single, annual fee that is affordable and equitably reflects regional economies. The annual fee is based on:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an &lt;strong&gt;institution’s &lt;/strong&gt;research output in the relevant &lt;strong&gt;subject area&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;helping us understand the likely potential to publish in the journal, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the relevant &lt;strong&gt;country’s &lt;/strong&gt;World Bank lending tier (i.e. Low/Low-Middle Income Country (L/LMIC), Upper Middle Income Country (UMIC), High Income Country (HIC). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Global Equity model’s annual price will therefore allow a large institution in a LMIC to pay less than one of comparable size in an HIC, but more than a small institution in an LMIC. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors at institutions in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.research4life.org/access/eligibility/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research4Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (R4L) countries (both group A and group B) can publish for free, regardless of the size of the institution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The following table shows the annual prices for institutions, per journal. Tier 1 is a high output institution in the subject area, to Tier 6 being a low output institution in the subject area. For example, a low output institution in a LMIC interested in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Climate &lt;/em&gt;would pay &lt;strong&gt;$350&lt;/strong&gt; per year to cover unlimited publishing by its authors in that journal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-table&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;has-fixed-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;HIC&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;UMIC&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;L/LMIC&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tier 1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$6,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$5,400&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,100&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tier 2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$4,500&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$4,050&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1,575&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tier 3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$3,750&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$3,375&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1,313&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tier 4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$3,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,700&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1,050&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tier 5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$2,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1,800&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$700&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tier 6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$1,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$900&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$350&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;R4L&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Global Equity model prices by research output tier and country category&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary Information and Comparison Table&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

 &lt;div class=&quot;mobile-wrap wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-medium is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780062897664&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;cover of &amp;quot;My Remarkable Journey&amp;quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099843&quot; height=&quot;263&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/060521_reviews_book-cover-254x383.jpg&quot; width=&quot;175&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780062897664&quot;&gt;My Remarkable Journey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Katherine Johnson with Joylette Hylick and Katherine Moore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amistad, $25.99&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Katherine Johnson became a household name circa 2016, when the bestselling book and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hidden-figures-highlights-three-black-women-who-were-vital-us-space-program&quot;&gt;Hollywood film &lt;em&gt;Hidden Figures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; highlighted her role as a NASA mathematician during the space race (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/21/17, p. 28&lt;/em&gt;). Those works showcased Johnson’s ability to perform high-stakes calculations to send astronauts to space, all while she endured racism and sexism from her colleagues. But crunching numbers for NASA is only part of Johnson’s story. Her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-icon-katherine-johnson-has-died-age-101-hidden-figures&quot;&gt;posthumous&lt;/a&gt; memoir, &lt;em&gt;My Remarkable Journey&lt;/em&gt;, tells the rest (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/24/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cowritten with two of her three daughters, Johnson’s memoir spends surprisingly little time explaining her work at NASA. Instead, the book focuses on Johnson’s personal life, including many experiences that reveal insight into the United States’ tumultuous race relations in the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Her account begins with her childhood in small-town West Virginia. Even then, Johnson’s thirst for knowledge was palpable: She snuck out to follow her older siblings to school, peppered her parents and teachers with questions, and counted everything in sight. While in college at West Virginia State University, Johnson decided she wanted to become a mathematician.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Readers quickly see the profound obstacles that faced educated Black people like Johnson. When she graduated in 1937 at age 18 with the highest GPA in her university’s history, Johnson had few employment opportunities. Her only job offer was a teaching gig at an all-Black elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Johnson uses her own educational and work experiences as windows into broader issues. She frequently pivots from her story to describe her teachers’ race-based struggles and the history of the Black schools she attended or served. These asides slow the narrative but reveal something deeper: Johnson’s immense pride in Black educational institutions and her gratitude to the Black educators who were her role models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Later chapters continue zooming out from Johnson’s own experiences to historic events. She describes her concerns about allowing her daughters to participate in school integration. “Once I’d seen what those Negro teenagers experienced in Little Rock, I couldn’t unsee it,” she writes of the white mob violence faced by Black students integrating into a white school in Arkansas. She also advised her daughters not to participate in civil rights protests because she was afraid of them getting hurt or arrested. (They protested anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At times, however, Johnson’s historical asides seem purely expositional. Readers may wish that the memoir directly offered Johnson’s unique perspective on some issues. For instance, she describes a protest led by Rev. Ralph Abernathy — Martin Luther King Jr.’s successor as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference — in objection to the taxpayer dollars spent on the space race rather than poverty relief. But Johnson doesn’t share her own reactions to this event.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also clear that Johnson isn’t comfortable bragging about herself. She touts the careers of other accomplished Black scientists and astronauts, but of her own work, she writes, “I was just doing [my] job.” That might seem like false modesty, but it rings true coming from a woman who didn’t invite her own daughters to her retirement luncheon at NASA because, as she writes in the book, she “didn’t want to make a big fuss.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more striking than Johnson’s unwavering humility is how she faced segregation and discrimination with her head held high. When she moved to the South for her first job, her mother warned her about the racism she would face: “Remember, you’re going to Virginia.” But Johnson just said, “Well, tell them I’m coming!” And when a white friend told Johnson that his pastor forbade Black guests at his wedding, “I just shrugged it off,” she writes. “I was not going to allow his pastor’s backward views to change my opinion of the lovely couple.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These examples of relentless determination in the face of adversity linger with the reader, showing what truly makes Johnson’s journey remarkable. Yes, her mathematical genius was inspiring. Equally inspiring was her grit.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Ancient tattooing tools are tough to find or even recognize as implements for creating skin designs. But new microscopic studies of two turkey leg bones with sharpened ends indicate that Native Americans used these items to make tattoos between around 5,520 and 3,620 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These pigment-stained bones are the world’s oldest known tattooing tools, say archaeologist Aaron Deter-Wolf of the Tennessee Division of Archaeology in Nashville and his colleagues. The find suggests that Native American tattoo traditions in eastern North America extend back &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-tattoo-tool-western-north-america&quot;&gt;more than a millennium earlier than previously thought&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/4/19&lt;/em&gt;). Ötzi the Iceman, who lived around 5,250 years ago in Europe, displays &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/iceman-has-worlds-oldest-tattoos&quot;&gt;the oldest known tattoos&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/13/16&lt;/em&gt;), but researchers haven’t found any of the tools used to make the Iceman’s tattoos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Excavations in 1985 revealed these turkey bones and other elements of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352409X21002145?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;a probable tattoo kit&lt;/a&gt; in a man’s burial pit at Tennessee’s Fernvale site, the researchers report in the June &lt;em&gt;Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports&lt;/em&gt;. Damage on and near the tips of the two turkey leg bones resembles distinctive wear &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352409X21002145?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;previously observed on experimental tattooing tools&lt;/a&gt; made from deer bones, Deter-Wolf’s team says. In that research, tattooed lines in fresh slabs of pig skin were produced by a series of punctures with tools that had tips coated in a homemade ink. Experimental tattooing left ink remnants several millimeters from tools’ tips, a pattern also seen with red and black pigment residues on the Fernvale tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two turkey wing bones found in the same Fernvale grave display microscopic wear and pigment residues that likely resulted from applying pigment during tattooing, the scientists say. Pigment-stained seashells in the grave may have held solutions into which tattooers dipped those tools.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gray-wolves-scare-deer-roads-reduce-car-collisions"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Gray wolves help keep North America’s deer populations in check, and by doing so, may provide an added benefit for people: curbing deer-vehicle collisions. In Wisconsin counties where wolf populations returned, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2023251118&quot;&gt;number of such collisions dropped&lt;/a&gt; in each area by 24 percent on average, scientists report online May 24 in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Economist Jennifer Raynor and colleagues analyzed data on wolf populations, deer populations and deer-vehicle collisions for 63 counties in Wisconsin from 1988 to 2010. In the 29 counties that had wolves, the predators thinning deer populations contributed about a 6 percent reduction in deer-vehicle collisions. The rest of the decrease, the team proposes, was due to the wolves’ presence near roads, which they use as travel corridors, creating a so-called “landscape of fear” that keeps deer away. That suggests that recreational hunters wouldn’t replicate wolves’ impact by simply culling the same number of deer, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The average drop of 38 deer-vehicle collisions per year in counties with wolves translates to an estimated $10.9 million in savings each year across the state, the team found. For comparison, the state paid about $3 million over the last 35 years to compensate for wolf damages. There may be other economic benefits not measured by the study such as reductions in damage to agriculture by deer and in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cases-lyme-and-other-tickborne-diseases-rising&quot;&gt;Lyme disease frequency&lt;/a&gt;, says Raynor of Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/15/18&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The most interesting thing to me about choosing Wisconsin as a case study is that this is a human-dominated landscape,” Raynor says. Similar analyses could guide management decisions where potential wolf habitats overlap with heavily populated areas, such as in the northeastern United States, she and colleagues propose.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A new type of gene therapy that rewires nerve cells in the eye has given a blind man some limited vision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 58-year-old man has a genetic disease called retinitis pigmentosa, which causes light-gathering cells in the retina to die. Before the treatment, known as optogenetic therapy, the man could detect some light but couldn’t see motion or pick out objects. Now he can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01351-4&quot;&gt;see and count objects&lt;/a&gt; and even reported being able to see the white stripes of a pedestrian crosswalk, researchers report May 24 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. His vision is still limited and requires him to wear special goggles that send pulses of light to the treated eye.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s exciting. It’s really good to see it working and getting some definite responses from patients,” says David Birch, a retinal degeneration expert at the Retina Foundation of the Southwest in Dallas. Birch has conducted clinical trials of other optogenetic therapies, but was not involved in this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;A man who has a degenerative eye disease is able to detect light, but can’t usually pick out objects. After optogenetic therapy and months of training with special goggles that send pulses of light to his treated eye, he was able to see a book and bottle of hand sanitizer on a table.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have been working for more than a decade on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-rewire-eye&quot;&gt;optogenetic therapies to restore vision&lt;/a&gt; to people with degenerative eye diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/15/15&lt;/em&gt;). The therapy involves using a light-sensitive protein to make nerve cells fire off a signal to the brain when hit with a certain wavelength of light.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Optogenetic therapy is different from traditional gene therapy, which replaces a faulty version of a gene with a healthy one. It is also different from gene editing, which uses molecular tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 to fix disease-causing variants in particular genes. In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-novel-gene-therapy-treat-patients-rare-form-inherited-vision-loss&quot;&gt;approved a traditional gene therapy&lt;/a&gt; that treats a rare forms of inherited blindness caused by mutations in the &lt;em&gt;RPE65&lt;/em&gt; gene. And other researchers are doing clinical trials of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-gene-editor-first-human-clinical-trials&quot;&gt;gene editing to correct one particular mutation&lt;/a&gt; that causes an inherited form of blindness called Leber congenital amaurosis 10 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/14/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those therapies may halt or slow progression of degenerative eye diseases, but don’t help people who have already lost vision, says Botond Roska, a neuroscientist and gene therapist at the Institute of Molecular and Clinical Ophthalmology Basel and the University of Basel in Switzerland. Gene therapy and gene editing also target only certain genes, but retinitis pigmentosa can be caused by changes in any one of more than 50 genes. Optogenetic therapy may help people who have lost their sight from many diseases regardless of the gene changes that cause them. Such diseases potentially include macular degeneration, which affects millions of people worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Earlier versions of optogenetic therapy used a protein called channelrhodopsin-2 from algae to make nerve cells respond to light. That protein requires lots of bright blue light to make it work. “It’s like staring at the sun in the desert,” says José-Alain Sahel, an ophthalmologist and retina specialist at the University of Pittsburgh and Sorbonne University in Paris. The level of light needed to turn the protein on could kill any remaining cells in the retina. So Sahel, Roska and colleagues developed their therapy using a different light-sensing protein that responds to amber light, which does less damage to cells than blue or green wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team used a virus called an adeno-associated virus to deliver instructions for making the protein to certain cells in the man’s eyes. The team chose to insert the instructions in a layer of nerve cells called ganglion cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The retina has three layers: Light-gathering rods and cones are at the back of the retina. Those photoreceptor cells are the first to die in the degenerative disease. Next comes a layer of nerve cells known as bipolar cells. They process visual information and pass signals on to ganglion cells in the third layer. The ganglion cells fire messages to visual centers in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seeing the light&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The retina is a multilayered tissue at the back of the eye. Light-detecting rods and cones sit at the very back of the tissue. Those photoreceptor cells pass information to the brain via bipolar cells and ganglion cells. Inherited blindness conditions and degenerative eye diseases can kill photoreceptors or strip them of their light-detecting parts. The remaining bipolar cells and ganglion cells stick around longer, making those cells prime targets for optogenetic therapy. Researchers have now inserted a protein that senses amber light into ganglion cells of a man with retinitis pigmentosa, restoring some vision.&lt;/p&gt;

HIRSHFELD; WEBVISION.MED.UTAH.EDU, ADAPTED BY J. HIRSHFELD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some researchers, including Sahel and Roska’s team, are also experimenting with inserting optogenetic proteins into bipolar cells, dormant cones (ones that have lost function but haven’t died) or other nerve cells. But ganglion cells were the easiest target, Roska says. They can be reached by simply injecting the virus into the center of the eye. And ganglion cells stick around long after rods, cones and bipolar cells have died.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The French man still cannot see without special goggles that send pulses of amber light to his eye. That is because ganglion cells usually respond to changes in light. If the light is constant, they don’t continue to fire, so pulses are needed, Roska says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, while normal vision can work in dim starlight to the sunniest day on the beach, the optogenetic proteins have a very limited range of light levels that they can operate under, says Zhuo-Hua Pan, a vision neuroscientist at Wayne State University in Detroit not involved in the research. The goggles use digital camera technology to automatically adjust light levels to send to the man’s eye. People who get optogenetic therapy might all need to wear goggles to help process visual information before it goes to the brain, Pan and Birch say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the goggles sending pulses of light to his treated eye, the man could see and recognize objects such as a book, cups and a bottle of hand sanitizer on a table.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers demonstrate that the goggles are necessary for the man to see the objects. To really show the therapy worked, the researchers would need to see if shining the amber light into his eye &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the therapy could be enough to allow him to see, says Sheila Nirenberg, a neuroscientist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City and founder of Bionic Sight, a company that is also using optogenetics to treat blindness. If so, that would suggest that just bright light, not the therapy itself, is behind the change in vision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her company reported in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/first-four-patients-in-bionic-sight-s-optogenetic-gene-therapy-trial-are-able-to-detect-light-and-motion/&quot;&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt; in March that blind people in its clinical trial could see light and motion after treatment. The results are preliminary. A full report from the clinical trial may be a year or more away, Nirenberg says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another company, Nanoscope Technologies in Bedford, Texas, said in a presentation at a virtual meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology in November that it had also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healio.com/news/ophthalmology/20201116/optogenetics-gene-therapy-may-improve-visual-acuity-in-advanced-retinitis-pigmentosa&quot;&gt;restored limited vision&lt;/a&gt; to some people with retinitis pigmentosa. But a full accounting of the data hasn’t been released. “Without the details it’s difficult to evaluate,” says Pan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; report is encouraging because it shows some of those details, although Pan says he wants to know more about what the patient can see outside of the lab. Still, he says he’s pleased that the work is finally yielding results. “We’ve been waiting to hear this for many years.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sahel and Roska stress that the therapy is not a cure for blindness.  “For now, all we can say is that there is one patient … with a functional difference,” Roska says. Sahel adds, “it’s a milestone on the road to even better outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The world is not exactly short of videos of cute cats up to strange antics. But one particular set of videos collected by cat owners during a COVID-19 lockdown reveals something genuinely interesting: a famous optical illusion that fools us also gets cats. The citizen science project, in which cats were experimented on in their own homes, shows that they, too, are tricked by “Kanizsa squares”, an illusion that suggests the presence of a square that doesn’t in fact exist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42227&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s well known that cats love to sit in enclosed spaces, like boxes. They even like to sit in square shapes made of tape, as documented during a 2017 Twitter craze (#CatSquare). So in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159121001258?dgcid=coauthor&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Applied Animal Behaviour Science&lt;/em&gt;, Gabriella E. Smith at City University of New York and colleagues took this further, to see if cats also show a preference for illusory squares.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of the 500 pet cats and owners who signed up to take part, 30 completed all the trials. The owners “were not aware of the study’s investigative purpose at any point before or during the experiment”, the authors write. (Well, they weren’t told what it was about, at least.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every day for six days, each owner put their cat out of the room while they taped a pair of stimuli to the floor. The researchers instructed them each day on which two of three stimuli to use: an actual square, a Kanizsa square (in which four Pacman-type cut-outs are arranged to suggest the lines of a square) and the Kanizsa control (in which the Pacman-type cut-outs face the other way.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-42231&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;42231&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;0&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Smith-et-al-2021&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Smith-et-al-2021.png?fit=845%2C508&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Smith-et-al-2021.png?fit=300%2C180&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Smith-et-al-2021.png?fit=875%2C526&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;875,526&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/05/24/cats-like-to-sit-in-squares-even-ones-that-are-really-optical-illusions/smith-et-al-2021/&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;505&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/digest.bps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Smith-et-al-2021.png?resize=842%2C505&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; width=&quot;842&quot; /&gt;Examples of Kanizsa squares (right) paired with the Kanizsa control (top panel) and actual square (bottom panel). &lt;em&gt;Via &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159121001258?dgcid=coauthor&quot;&gt;Smith et al (2021)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The owner then put on sunglasses (so their cat couldn’t use their gaze as a cue to what to do), brought the cat into the room, and started videoing. If, within five minutes, their pet sat or stood within either of the shapes, the trial ended. Either way, after five minutes, they submitted the result.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of those 30 cats who completed all the trials, nine cats chose to inside a stimulus at least once — and, in total between them, 16 times. On eight of these occasions, a cat sat inside an actual square. On seven, it sat inside a Kanizsa square. In contrast, the Kanizsa control was chosen only once. This suggests that cats treat the Kanizsa squares just like real ones. Like us (and dogs, chimps, and many other animals, in fact) they show “susceptibility to illusory contours.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recruiting pet owners to do experiments themselves clearly has some downsides. Very few of those who signed up actually completed the full study. Also, light levels might have varied quite a bit across the various homes, and this could have influenced the cats’ decisions, the team notes. However, there are also good reasons to study cats in their own homes, rather than a lab. As they’re more relaxed at home, their behaviour is likely to be more natural.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study provides further evidence that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/09/heres-the-first-evidence-that-even-lizards-succumb-to-optical-illusions/&quot;&gt;animals experience all kinds of illusions&lt;/a&gt;. But it also gives further insight into cat cognition, which has received little attention compared to that of dogs. Quite why not isn’t clear. However, given the useful, if limited, data from this new study, the researchers write: “the use of citizen science as a precursor to in-lab investigations of cat cognition could greatly help bridge this divide.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159121001258?dgcid=coauthor&quot;&gt;If I fits I sits: A citizen science investigation into illusory contour susceptibility in domestic cats (&lt;em&gt;Felis silvestris catus&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The most recent federal guidance on wearing masks offered a glimmer of hope that the pandemic’s end was inching closer, but it has also caused confusion, anger and worry. On May 13, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that fully vaccinated individuals no longer had to wear masks indoors, except in hospitals, on public transit and in other specified places. In that directive, there was incentive for people who hadn’t yet been vaccinated against COVID-19 to go get their shots, but the guidance also left even experts wondering what it meant for individuals and society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Some unfortunately interpreted this guidance as an immediate end to the indoor mask mandates or that the COVID-19 epidemic is essentially over,” Jeffrey Duchin, a public health expert with Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County, told reporters in an Infectious Diseases Society of America news briefing on May 20. That is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The United States is still recording more than 24,000 cases and about 500 deaths each day from COVID-19. That’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhj-yWThkLQ&quot;&gt;lowest level in the last 10 months&lt;/a&gt;, Gregory Poland, an infectious diseases expert who heads the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group in Rochester, Minn., said May 18 in a podcast. But only &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations&quot;&gt;38 percent of the total population was fully vaccinated &lt;/a&gt;by May 20, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recommendation that vaccinated people could forgo masks caught experts off guard, Poland said. “We are only just now getting to a reduced level over the last two weeks of cases, deaths and hospitalizations. By the way, we were at this same level almost one year ago and look at what happened in the intervening year.” With the current levels of vaccination, “this feels a month or two premature in my mind,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Duchin, Poland and other experts weigh in on the CDC’s recommendation and what it means for the pandemic’s future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;What’s the science the CDC used to make the decision?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There were two key pieces of information that the CDC’s recommendation is based on, says Céline Gounder, an infectious diseases specialist and epidemiologist at New York University Grossman School of Medicine and Bellevue Hospital in New York City. First, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-moderna-pfizer-transmission-disease&quot;&gt;real-world studies have shown that mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; from Pfizer and Moderna “reduce risk of infection, not just severe disease, hospitalization and death,” says Gounder, who hosts the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/epidemic-with-dr-celine-gounder/id1499394284&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epidemic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;podcast (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/30/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vaccines are very good, but they aren’t perfect. Some vaccinated people may still catch the coronavirus. But even “if you are one of those individuals who gets a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccines-breakthrough-infections-variants&quot;&gt;rare breakthrough infection&lt;/a&gt;, your risk of transmitting [the virus] onward to other people is exceedingly low,” Gounder says (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/4/21&lt;/em&gt;). That’s the second piece of evidence that swayed CDC’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The science is correct,” she says. “What they got wrong is the communications, the behavioral science and the all-of-government approach that needs to be coordinated on the local level.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;What else should the CDC have taken into consideration when making this decision on masks?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are less effective at preventing infection with some more transmissible &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccines-coronavirus-variants-challenges&quot;&gt;coronavirus variants&lt;/a&gt;, including the B.1.351 variant first discovered in South Africa, B.1.617 first reported in India and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-p1-variant-brazil-strain-transmission-immunity&quot;&gt;P.1 first detected in Brazil&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN:1/27/21&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;SN: 4/14/21&lt;/em&gt;). Those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-surge-4th-wave-us-young-cases-vaccination&quot;&gt;variants have been spreading rapidly&lt;/a&gt;, even while cases of infections with earlier versions of the virus have declined, says Ali Mokdad, a public health researcher at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/3/21&lt;/em&gt;). While the mRNA vaccines are still about 72 percent to 75 percent effective against the variants, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s vaccine is about 57 percent effective. And vaccines used in other parts of the world are even less effective, potentially leaving more than half of vaccinated people vulnerable to breakthrough infections with the variants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Masks can help slow the virus’ spread. Simulating spread, Mokdad and colleagues previously predicted that COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-cases-deaths-prediction-summer-winter-surge&quot;&gt;decline over the summer, but rebound in the fall &lt;/a&gt;and winter (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/23/21&lt;/em&gt;). That rebound will start sooner, probably about mid-August, if people aren’t wearing masks and vaccine hesitancy remains at current levels, Mokdad says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Cases will go up and mortality will go up,” he says. It won’t be as severe as last winter’s surge thanks to vaccination, but deaths could peak at more than 2,000 a day. That compares with a peak of 500 deaths a day if mask-wearing is high.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mokdad is fully vaccinated but continues to wear a mask when around people outside of his household. Some people have charged that vaccinated people who continue to mask up are signaling that vaccines don’t work, but that’s not how Mokdad sees it. “I trust the vaccines,” he says. “I don’t trust the virus. This virus is so opportunistic.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Knowing human behavior, does changing the masking guidelines make sense? &lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The short answer: probably not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s because the CDC’s new guidance assumes that unvaccinated individuals will continue masking, even though people in the United States are not required to show proof of vaccination. This honor system is in contrast to Israel, where vaccinated individuals carry vaccine passports called Green Passes that grant them admission to businesses. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health officials in this country are “hoping that people will be rational actors,” says medical anthropologist Martha Lincoln of San Francisco State University. “I think that is very unfortunate.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest guidance also lacks cultural sensitivity, say Lincoln and others. This decision prioritizes the needs of those who are already vaccinated or have chosen not to vaccinate, while trivializing the risk to vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some parents worry that unmasked and unvaccinated individuals could threaten the safety of their young children, for whom the vaccine is not yet available. That may be a valid concern. In elementary schools in Georgia in November and December, cases of COVID-19 were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7021e1.htm?s_cid=mm7021e1_w&quot;&gt;37 percent lower&lt;/a&gt; in schools that required teachers and staff members to wear masks and 39 percent lower in schools that upgraded ventilation, according to a May 21 &lt;em&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/em&gt;. Vaccination rates also continue to remain lower among Black and Hispanic people in the United States due, in part, to limited access to the shots, leaving many at higher risk. People with compromised immune systems, even if vaccinated, are still vulnerable too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Past epidemics have illustrated the pitfalls of ignoring politics and culture when disease strikes, researchers wrote in the April 2020 &lt;em&gt;Open Anthropology. &lt;/em&gt;Namely, absent a culturally sensitive campaign, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americananthro.org/StayInformed/OAArticleDetail.aspx?ItemNumber=25631&quot;&gt;disease will likely continue to spread among vulnerable populations&lt;/a&gt; resulting in spillover to majority populations. The AIDS epidemic is an example. Two decades after an early strain appeared in Haiti in the 1960s, U.S. officials singled out gay men and heroin users as drivers of the disease. Later studies have shown that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/sj.embor.embor844&quot;&gt;structural inequities&lt;/a&gt;, such as poor access to medical care in areas most in need and vulnerability to the disease due to pre-existing conditions related to poverty, racism and other factors, were the larger culprit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health officials’ response to COVID-19 has been similar, Lincoln says. “Without understanding the bigger political, informational and cultural dynamics that are factoring into people’s behavior … we’re not going to really move things forward.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health officials could have made throwing away that face mask a goal of the vaccination program, Lincoln says. They could have said, for instance, that when a given county has vaccinated, say, 70 percent of the population, the masks could come off. Now, though, reinstituting a mask mandate would be akin to trying to stick toothpaste back into the tube, she says. “You can’t walk this back.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mokdad agrees. “In public health messaging, it’s not about what you say. It’s what people hear.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Vaccines were tested when people were wearing masks. Will this change affect the shots’ effectiveness?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Theoretically there might be more breakthrough infections if people stop wearing masks overall, Jeanne Marrazzo, an infectious disease physician at the University of Alabama at Birmingham said May 20 during an Infectious Diseases Society of America news briefing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, even during the winter surge in the United States there was enormous variability in how people wore masks — with some people wearing masks under their nose, for instance, or not masking up at all. And since all vaccine clinical trial participants were probably wearing masks — correctly or not — vaccinated people should still have the same relative protection from the coronavirus compared with unvaccinated people even when masks aren’t in the equation, Duchin said in the same briefing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, when U.S. vaccine trials were going on, “transmission was rampant. There was so much disease out there that you really had to go out of your way not to get exposed,” Marrazzo said. “In general, I feel confident that the estimates that we got from those trials are going to play out in the real world as things move forward.” That’s assuming no new, highly contagious variants emerge that overwhelm vaccinated populations, she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;How do we move forward and continue to protect vulnerable populations?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the CDC said vaccinated people could go without masks, “it made it more difficult for governors and mayors, companies and universities to have policies that still protect some of their vulnerable populations,” says Julie Swann, a disease modeler and health systems expert at North Carolina State University in Raleigh.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That leaves it up to each individual to decide whether to mask up or not. They have to factor in things like how widely the virus is spreading locally and local vaccination rates, the prevalence of more contagious variants, and the efficacy of the vaccine they got. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-one-shot-fda-authorization&quot;&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s vaccine&lt;/a&gt; had lower efficacy in clinical trials than the mRNA vaccines, for instance (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/27/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Robert Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Bob_Wachter/status/1394464864521789443&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that he would go maskless indoors under three conditions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If everyone in the room has been vaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If any unvaccinated people present are wearing masks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Or if the local COVID-19 rate is so low that it’s unlikely that an unmasked, unvaccinated person might carry the virus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not an easy calculation, Swann says, noting she’d still wear a mask because her 9-year-old isn’t eligible for a vaccine yet. Still, the pandemic “has made masks more accessible and acceptable to many people in the United States.” That’s important because we could be asked to mask again when cold and flu season comes around or if COVID-19 case counts climb or new variants burst through immune defenses or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-pandemic-vaccine-questions-immunity-variants&quot;&gt;immunity wanes&lt;/a&gt;, she says. “The good thing about masks is that they’re an easy on-off button,” (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/11/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;If the decision to wear a mask is left to each individual, what are the social costs?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unvaccinated people who incorrectly interpret CDC’s guidelines to mean that they don’t need to wear a mask, “will have neither the protection of the mask, nor the protection of the vaccine,” Gounder says. Vaccinated people “might think, ‘Oh, it’s not my problem. They’re just infecting one another.’” That’s not entirely true, because children younger than 12 aren’t eligible for the vaccine yet and there are people who have been vaccinated but remain vulnerable to infection because of weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 spreading among the unvaccinated carries other costs, too, she says. When those people end up in the hospital, if they have private insurance, those costs get passed on to others as higher insurance premiums. If the person is on a government health plan, such as Medicare, Medicaid or Tricare for military members and their families, the costs are passed on to taxpayers. And if the person has no insurance, hospitals pass costs on to other patients. “It’s not like this is cost-free and doesn’t impact the rest of us, too.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CDC’s word also puts pressure on other countries to follow suit, says Mokdad. But vaccination rates vary widely, some places already have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-india-crisis-social-distancing-masks-variant&quot;&gt;hospital systems overwhelmed by the virus&lt;/a&gt; and new coronavirus variants are on the rise (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/9/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CDC said, ‘It’s over. Go get the vaccine and you can go back to your normal life,’” he says. But just because people are tired of wearing masks doesn’t mean CDC should give them license to dispense with them, he adds. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic&quot;&gt;Well-fitting masks&lt;/a&gt; can greatly reduce the risk of infection (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/12/21&lt;/em&gt;), and combined with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration&quot;&gt;ventilation and filtration&lt;/a&gt; masks are a great public health tool, Mokdad says (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/18/21&lt;/em&gt;). It took years to get people to accept seatbelts, condoms and motorcycle helmets, but CDC didn’t give up promoting them. “We didn’t say, ‘Oh, people don’t like condoms so we should tell them to go have sex without a condom.’ So why are we changing our public health approach [on masks]? It’s frustrating.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CDC’s recommendation is a blanket statement that may not be applicable for everyone, especially people who live in places with high case counts and low vaccination rates, Gounder says. “There needs to be more nuance and detail communicated here.”&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/urchins-sea-stars-predator-prey"/>

		<updated>2021-05-21T13:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Sea urchins are underwater lawnmowers, their unabating, vegetarian appetites capable of altering whole nearshore ecosystems. But the spiny invertebrates will also sink their teeth into something a bit more challenging — and dangerous — new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a first, researchers recently discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eth.13147&quot;&gt;urchins attacking and eating predatory sea stars&lt;/a&gt;. The observations flip a classic predator-prey script, researchers report in the June &lt;em&gt;Ethology&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2018, marine behavioral ecologist Jeff Clements and his colleagues were at the Kristineberg Marine Research Station in Fiskebäckskil, Sweden, studying common sun stars (&lt;em&gt;Crossaster papposus&lt;/em&gt;). At one point, Clements wanted to separate one of the sun stars for a short while and needed aquarium space. He placed the starfish in a tank containing about 80 green sea urchins (&lt;em&gt;Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I thought, ‘Okay, there’s a bunch of sea urchins in there, these guys are predators of urchins, nothing’s gonna happen,’” recalls Clements, of Fisheries and Oceans Canada in Moncton. The urchins, he says, hadn’t eaten anything in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The next day, when Clements came into the lab, he couldn’t find the sun star. There was a pile of urchins on the side of the tank, with something red barely visible underneath. Clements pried the urchins off, revealing the victim.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The sea star was absolutely decimated,” he says. “The urchins had just ripped it apart.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clements and his colleagues soon realized this behavior hadn’t been documented before, So, the team ran two trials, each with a single sun star in the urchin tank, recording how this “predator-prey role reversal” plays out. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One urchin would approach the sun star, feeling around, eventually attaching to one of the sun star’s many arms. Other urchins would follow suit, covering the sun star’s arms. When the team removed the urchins after about an hour, they found the arm tips were chewed off, along with the eyes and other sensory organs positioned there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;four sea urchins attached to arms of sea star&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099770&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/051321JB_urchin_inline-677x450.jpg&quot; width=&quot;677&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099770&quot;&gt;Within minutes, green sea urchins (&lt;em&gt;Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis&lt;/em&gt;) attached themselves to a sun star’s arms, pinning the animal in place and gnawing at its sensitive, eyed arm tips.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099770&quot;&gt;Jeff Clements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This aspect of the sun star’s anatomy may put it at a disadvantage. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“[The tips] are the first part of the sun star that the urchin is going to encounter as it approaches,” says Clements. “So if the urchin consumes those first, the sun star is going to be less effective at escaping the attacks.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team has named this incapacitation “urchin pinning.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s possible the urchins are acting in self-defense, preemptively destroying a predator in their midst. Though, it could be the urchins’ relative hunger that’s behind the attacks instead, says Julie Schram, an animal physiologist at the University of Alaska Southeast in Juneau not involved with the research. In crowded lab conditions with limited food — similar to this study — urchins can switch up their diet in surprising ways, she notes. Some species have been documented cannibalizing each other, for instance.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This would suggest to me that when starved, adult urchins will seek out alternate food sources,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Urchins’ capacity to feed on predatory sea stars had been hinted at before, with sea stars turning up in urchin stomach contents, says Jason Hodin, a marine biologist at the University of Washington in Friday Harbor. But this was often interpreted as scavenging. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Active predation was the more interesting possibility, and it’s satisfying to see that possibility confirmed, at least in the lab,” says Hodin, who was not involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If these urchin attacks are something that also happens in the wild, Clements thinks there could be some interesting ramifications for kelp forest ecosystems. When overabundant, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-kelp-forests-california-urchin-takeover-sea-otter&quot;&gt;urchins can graze kelp forests down to nothing&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/29/21&lt;/em&gt;), leaving behind urchin “barrens.” If urchins are feeding on whatever animals are left behind, it’d be easier for their numbers to remain high.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If [the urchins] are using animals to persist in these urchin barrens when kelp is low or nonexistent, it could actually delay the recovery of these kelp forests back to their original state,” says Clements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such discussions of ecosystem influences are premature, says marine ecologist Megan Dethier, and are making way too much out of a “peculiar lab situation.” Such attacks haven’t been documented even in urchin barrens, where food is scarce, notes Dethier, of the University of Washington Friday Harbor Laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the urchin attacks can’t be intentional since the animals don’t have a brain or central nervous system, she says. “Urchins doing a coordinated predatory attack is not biologically feasible.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The synchronized attacks may be based on chemical consequences of the ongoing feeding releasing smells into the water, Clements says. Once the first urchin starts chewing on the sun star, the other urchins may start recognizing the sun star as food. In the future, Clements wants to run experiments manipulating the hunger and density of urchins to see what factors influence their appetite for sun stars. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings are a reminder that even with simple nervous systems, invertebrates like urchins can execute surprisingly complex behaviors, Clements says. “These animals aren’t just kicking around doing nothing on the [sea] bottom.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is ample evidence that inequality exists — in the UK alone, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2021/jan/03/richest-1-have-almost-a-quarter-of-uk-wealth-study-claims&quot;&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; suggested, the richest 1% have a quarter of the country’s wealth, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/race-report-statistics&quot;&gt;marginalised groups experience inequality&lt;/a&gt; in relation to work, education, living standards, healthcare &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lse.ac.uk/gender/assets/documents/research/gender-inequality-and-power-commission/Confronting-Gender-Inequality-blue.pdf&quot;&gt;and more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, not everyone is attentive to inequality. While some are keenly focused on its causes and its solutions, others believe it’s simply not important, or at the very least that it’s exaggerated. So what determines whether we pay attention to inequality?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/14/e2023985118&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, argues that our ideological stance on equality may be key. Unsurprisingly, the team finds that social egalitarians were more likely to notice signs of inequality — but only when it affected certain groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42180&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 2,204 participants were shown a series of photographs depicting urban scenes, half of which contained indications of inequality such as wealthy women receiving pedicures or &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/14/visible-reminders-of-inequality-can-raise-support-for-taxing-the-wealthy/&quot;&gt;luxury cars&lt;/a&gt;. Participants were then asked what they had noticed in the images, with no mention of inequality in the prompt. Finally, they completed a survey that measured their levels of social egalitarianism — that is, how much they prioritise social equality — indicating how much they agreed with statements like “Some groups of people must be kept in their place”. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those with low levels of social egalitarianism were significantly less likely to specifically mention inequality or to mention the inequality-related indicators. Social egalitarians, on the other hand, were more likely to mention inequality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As it was not clear whether those with low levels of social egalitarianism were noticing but failing to mention inequality or simply not seeing it at all, the second study focused on the detection of inequality. Participants viewed a series of pairs of images, one depicting a group of men and the other a group of women, each accompanied by a set of money bags. In equal trials, men and women had the same number of money bags, while in unequal trials the men were shown with more. Participants had to indicate whether the images depicted equal or unequal distribution of resources. Those high in social egalitarianism were more accurate at the task than those with low levels, suggesting that anti-egalitarians are less likely to notice inequality as well as less likely to mention it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each study so far had explored attention to inequality experienced by particularly marginalised groups such as women. So, in the next study, the team looked at whether social egalitarians were also better at noticing inequality against socially &lt;em&gt;advantaged&lt;/em&gt; groups, too. Participants watched a video of a discussion panel, made up of two men and two women. In one condition, the men spoke one and a half times longer than the women, and in the other the women spoke one and a half times longer than the men. Participants were then asked whether men or women had spent more time speaking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Social egalitarians were more likely to accurately notice when men spoke more than women; but when women spoke more than men, there was no significant difference between egalitarian and anti-egalitarian participants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the final study, participants were privy to a hiring process in which the employer was either biased against minorities or against white applicants. And as in the previous studies, social egalitarians were significantly more likely to notice bias against racial minorities, but less likely to notice bias against white candidates. Anti-egalitarians, however, were more likely to notice the anti-white bias.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, the results suggest, social egalitarians are more attentive to social inequality against marginalised groups, and less likely to notice disadvantages against less marginalised groups like men or white people. (Another study conducted earlier this year similarly found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/04/advocates-of-equality-for-all-are-more-likely-to-show-prejudice-against-older-adults-at-work/&quot;&gt;egalitarians were more likely to show prejudice against older people at work&lt;/a&gt;, particularly older white men).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, it’s worth remembering that inequalities against marginalised groups are structural and wide-ranging, significantly affecting millions of people on an everyday basis. For more advantaged groups, like white men, disadvantages are on a smaller scale — speaking less than women on a panel, to use an example from the study, is hardly a serious social inequality. In this respect, it makes sense that those concerned with social inequality focus their attention on those groups who are most affected by it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say that there aren’t areas in which men in particular are disadvantaged — male &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/01/male-suicide-rate-england-wales-covid-19&quot;&gt;suicide rates,&lt;/a&gt; for example, are extremely concerning. Further research could benefit from comparing more serious examples like this, where social egalitarians may be more attentive, rather than with small-scale issues like panel discussions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/14/e2023985118&quot;&gt;Ideology selectively shapes attention to inequality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/©-BillionPhotos.com_-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are all aware of the effect COVID-19 has had on our day-to-day lives, but how about COVID’s effects on academia? The COVID-19 pandemic caused an outbreak of scientific evidence. As of April 2021, the number of unique publications indexed by our &lt;a href=&quot;https://zika.ispm.unibe.ch/assets/data/pub/search_beta/&quot;&gt;living evidence database&lt;/a&gt;, created to retrieve COVID-19 publications, exceeded 160,000. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01244-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;our research&lt;/a&gt;, we compared the patterns of scientific publications for the two infections, the Zika virus emergence in 2016 and SARS-CoV-2, to assess the evolution of the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The living evidence database was created initially for retrieving publications on Zika virus. In 2016, we included around 50-60 new Zika virus articles per week in our database. We thought it would be an easy transition to switch to indexing COVID-19 articles in late 2019. However, we were shocked by the sheer volume of published articles retrieved, which came to around 2,500 articles per week at the end of April 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the evidence evaluation for Zika virus, we identified and classified 2,286 publications in 2016. However, for SARS-CoV-2, although we recruited a group of international volunteer scientists with a background in health sciences to cope with the volume, we were only able to analyze a random sample of 5,294 (24%) out of 21,990 articles that were published before 24 May 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A substantial proportion of articles indexed were non-original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proportions of epidemiological study designs&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Our findings showed that a substantial proportion of articles indexed were non-original (commentaries, basic reviews, opinion papers, etc.) for both Zika virus (55%) and SARS-CoV-2 (34%, [95% Confidence interval (Cl): 33-35]). The role of preprints was more prominent at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic than the Zika virus epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case reports and case series accounted for approximately 10% of the total body of evidence for both SARS-CoV-2 (10.7% [95% CI: 9.9-11.6]) and Zika virus (9.7%) research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case-control and cohort studies accounted for 4.0% [95% CI: 3.5-4.6] for SARS-CoV-2 and 0.8% for Zika virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trials emerged in smaller numbers (27/5,294 for SARS -CoV-2, and 1/2,286 for Zika virus) and at the beginning of the outbreak, there were more mathematical modelling studies for SARS-CoV-2 (10.1%, [95% CI: 9.3-11.0]), when compared with Zika virus (3.2%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-study type trends&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Case reports, case series and cross-sectional studies were the first epidemiological study designs to be reported, together with non-original articles and reviews. Case-control and cohort studies followed later; this delay was more prominent in the Zika virus research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; laboratory studies followed between case reports and controlled observational studies. Trials were the last type of study to be published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it all mean?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Emerging infectious diseases are accompanied by a vast quantity of published evidence quickly, which is a significant challenge that clinicians, scientists, researchers, and even students have to face. Keeping up with the available evidence becomes a complicated task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed of SARS-CoV-2 evidence accumulation was unprecedented. Although we recruited a large team of experienced scientists, we reached a point where we could not categorize all the evidence retrieved by our database within the first few months of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tackle this issue, we believe the use of natural language processing methods to help classify and categorize evidence seems like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0895-4356(17)30604-2&quot;&gt;promising approach for the triage of publication&lt;/a&gt; types not only for SARS-CoV-2 but for future emerging diseases. Also, collaborative crowd-sourcing within scientists in the field could increase researchers’ efficiency and &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(13)62329-6&quot;&gt;prevent research waste&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assessing the evidence during emerging infections can help us identify which types of public health questions we can answer and when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessing the evidence during emerging infections can help us identify which types of public health questions we can answer and when. Further research on evidence evaluation during emerging outbreaks could help improve the public health response. With the accumulation of evidence during particular situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of specific resources can save time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the amount of evidence published every day on this non-ending pandemic, students, clinicians, and stakeholders need to approach the published studies with caution. Some of the studies available might be providing wrong findings or conclusions, and people might ‘cherry pick’ what aligns with their beliefs. We need critical eyes to scrutinize all available evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The cosmos keeps outdoing itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Extremely energetic light from space is an unexplained wonder of astrophysics, and now scientists have spotted this light, called gamma rays, at higher energies than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory, LHAASO, spotted more than 530 gamma rays with energies above &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03498-z&quot;&gt;0.1 quadrillion electron volts&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report online May 17 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. The highest-energy gamma ray detected was about 1.4 quadrillion electron volts. For comparison, protons in the largest accelerator on Earth, the Large Hadron Collider, reach mere trillions of electron volts. Previously, the most energetic gamma ray known &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-new-high-energy-light-gamma-glow-secrets-cosmic-rays&quot;&gt;had just under a quadrillion electron volts&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/2/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In all, the scientists spotted 12 gamma ray hot spots, hinting that the Milky Way harbors powerful cosmic particle accelerators. In order for gamma rays to reach such energies, electromagnetic fields must first rev up charged particles, namely protons or electrons, to immense speeds. Those particles can then produce energetic gamma rays, for example, when protons interact with other matter in space.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists aren’t yet sure what environments are powerful enough to produce light with energies reaching more than a quadrillion electron volts. But the new observations point to two possibilities. One hot spot was associated with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/highest-energy-photons-ever-seen-hail-crab-nebula&quot;&gt;Crab Nebula&lt;/a&gt;, the turbulent remains of an exploded star (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/24/19&lt;/em&gt;). Another potential source was the Cygnus Cocoon, a region where massive stars are forming, blasting out intense winds in the process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LHAASO, located on Haizi Mountain in China’s Sichuan province, is not yet fully operational. When it is completed later this year, it is expected to find even more energetic gamma rays.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2021-hurricane-forecast-atlantic-noaa"/>

		<updated>2021-05-20T20:51:47+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season is a tough act to follow. But U.S. Atlantic coast residents shouldn’t let their guard down — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/noaa-predicts-another-active-atlantic-hurricane-season&quot;&gt;2021 will still be an active year for storms&lt;/a&gt;, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in a May 20 press conference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NOAA’s forecast for the Atlantic hurricane season, which lasts from June 1 through November 30, predicts 13 to 20 named storms, with six to 10 of those developing into hurricanes, and three to five into major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher. By comparison, 2020 racked up 31 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2020-storm-theta-record-atlantic-hurricane-climate&quot;&gt;tropical and sub-tropical cyclones&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/10/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An average Atlantic hurricane season is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/average-atlantic-hurricane-season-to-reflect-more-storms&quot;&gt;busier than it used to be&lt;/a&gt;, NOAA announced in April. The new “normal” is now based on averages from 1991 to 2020 rather than 1981 to 2010. Instead of 12 named storms and six hurricanes, an average season now has 14 named storms and seven hurricanes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of the climate conditions that fostered 2020’s busy season continue into 2021: very warm waters in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, weaker trade winds across the Atlantic and a strong West African monsoon. The notable exception is that 2020 was a La Niña year, a phase of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-may-make-el-nino-la-nina-less-predictable&quot;&gt;the El Niño Southern Oscillation weather pattern&lt;/a&gt; that can juice up Atlantic hurricane seasons (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/21/19&lt;/em&gt;). There’s no La Niña so far in 2021, although it could return later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The most realistic computer simulation of star formation yet offers stunning views of what the inside of a stellar nursery might look like.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the Star Formation in Gaseous Environments simulation, or STARFORGE, a giant virtual cloud of gas collapses into a nest of new stars. Unlike other simulations, which could render only a small clump of gas within a larger cloud, STARFORGE simulates an entire star-forming cloud. It’s also the first simulation to account for &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnras/stab1347/6276745&quot;&gt;the whole medley of physical phenomena thought to influence star formation&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report online May 17 in &lt;em&gt;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We sort of know the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/high-speed-gas-collisions-prevent-star-birth-galaxies-bars&quot;&gt;basic story of star formation&lt;/a&gt; … but the devil is in the details,” says Mike Grudić, a theoretical astrophysicist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/21/20&lt;/em&gt;). Astronomers still don’t fully understand, for instance, why stars have different masses. “If you really want to get the full picture, then you really have to just simulate the whole thing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;In the computer simulation STARFORGE, a massive cloud of cosmic gas — roughly 20 parsecs, or 65 light-years, across — collapses to form new stars. White areas indicate denser regions of gas, including baby stars. Orange highlights places where there’s lots of variation in the gas motion, such as in powerful jets launched by new stars. Gas shown in purple is more tranquil. After 4.3 million years (Myr) have passed, the simulation pauses so the virtual camera can swoop around the cloud, revealing its 3-D structure.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;STARFORGE starts with a blob of gas that can be tens to hundreds of light-years across and up to millions of times the mass of the sun. Turbulence inside the cloud creates dense pockets that collapse to forge new stars. Those stars then launch powerful jets, give off radiation, shed stellar winds and explode in supernovas. Eventually, these phenomena blow the last vestiges of the cloud away and leave behind a hive of young stars. The whole process takes millions of years — or months of computing time, even running on supercomputers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using STARFORGE, Grudić and colleagues have confirmed that jets launched by new stars help regulate how much material a star amasses. In simulations without jets, typical stars were about 10 times the mass of the sun — way bigger than the actual average star. “As soon as you add this jet feedback to your simulation,” Grudić says, “stellar masses start coming out more or less right on the dot for what they’re observed to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;If a tree farts in the forest, does it make a sound? No, but it does add a smidge of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gases released by dead trees — dubbed “tree farts” — account for &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10533-021-00797-5&quot;&gt;roughly one-fifth of the greenhouse gases&lt;/a&gt; emitted by skeletal, marshy forests along the coast of North Carolina, researchers report online May 10 in &lt;em&gt;Biogeochemistry&lt;/em&gt;. While these emissions pale in comparison with other sources, an accurate accounting is necessary to get a full picture of where climate-warming gases come from.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A team of ecologists went sniffing for tree farts in ghost forests, which form when saltwater from rising sea levels poisons a woodland, leaving behind a marsh full of standing dead trees. These phantom ecosystems are expected to expand with climate change, but it’s unclear exactly how they contribute to the world’s carbon budget.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The emergence of ghost forests is one of the biggest changes happening in response to sea level rise,” says Keryn Gedan, a coastal ecologist at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who was not involved in the work. “As forests convert to wetlands, we expect over long timescales that’s going to represent a substantial carbon sink,” she says, since wetlands store more carbon than forests. But in the short term, dead trees decay and stop taking up carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, “so that’s going to be a major greenhouse gas source.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;To better understand how ghost forests pass gas into the atmosphere, the researchers measured greenhouse gases wafting off dead trees and soil in five ghost forests on the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula in North Carolina. “It’s kind of eerie” out there, says Melinda Martinez, a wetland ecologist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Martinez ain’t afraid of no ghost forest. In 2018 and 2019, she measured CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from dead trees using a portable gas analyzer she toted on her back. “I definitely looked like a ghostbuster,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;a woman wearing waders and a backpack-type device&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099747&quot; height=&quot;510&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/051721_mt_tree-farts_inline_680.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099747&quot;&gt;Wetland ecologist Melinda Martinez totes a portable gas analyzer on her back to measure the “tree farts” emitted by a ghost forest tree. A tube connects the gas analyzer to an airtight seal around the trunk of the tree.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099747&quot;&gt;M. Ardón&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soils gave off most of the greenhouse gases from the ghost forests. Each square meter of ground emitted an average 416 milligrams of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 5.9 milligrams of methane and 0.1 milligrams of nitrous oxide per hour. On average, dead trees released about 116 milligrams of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.3 milligrams of methane and 0.04 milligrams of nitrous oxide per square meter per hour — totaling about one-fourth the soil’s emissions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measuring greenhouse gases from the trees is “kind of measuring the last breath of these forests,” says Marcelo Ardón, an ecosystems ecologist and biogeochemist at North Carolina State University. The dead trees “don’t emit a ton, but they are important” to a ghost forest’s overall emissions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ardón coined the term “tree farts” to describe the dead trees’ greenhouse gas emissions. “I have an 8-year-old and an 11-year-old, and fart jokes are what we talk about,” he explains. But the analogy has a biological basis, too. Actual farts are caused by microbes in the body; the greenhouse gases emitted by ghost forests are created by microbes in the soil and trees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the grand scheme of carbon emissions, ghost forests’ role may be minor. Tree farts, for instance, have nothing on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/getting-creative-cut-methane-cows&quot;&gt;cow burps&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 11/18/15&lt;/em&gt;). A single dairy cow can emit up to 27 grams of methane — a far more potent greenhouse gas than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; — per hour. But accounting for even minor sources of carbon is important for fine-tuning our understanding of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/where-earth-stores-its-carbon&quot;&gt;the global carbon budget&lt;/a&gt;, says Martinez (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/1/19&lt;/em&gt;). So it would behoove scientists not to turn up their noses at ghost tree farts.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Shabnam Kadir will talk about a paper &quot;Feasibility of Topological Data Analysis for Event-Related fMRI&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent fMRI research shows that perceptual and cognitive representations are
instantiated in high-dimensional multivoxel patterns in the brain. However, the
methods for detecting these representations are limited. Topological data
analysis (TDA) is a new approach, based on the mathematical field of topology,
that can detect unique types of geometric features in patterns of data. Several
recent studies have successfully applied TDA to study various forms of neural
data; however, to our knowledge, TDA has not been successfully applied to data
from event-related fMRI designs. Event-related fMRI is very common but limited
in terms of the number of events that can be run within a practical time frame
and the effect size that can be expected. Here, we investigate whether
persistent homology- a popular TDA tool that identifies topological
features in data and quantifies their robustness- can identify known
signals given these constraints. We use fmrisim, a Python-based simulator of
realistic fMRI data, to assess the plausibility of recovering a simple
topological representation under a variety of conditions. Our results suggest
that persistent homology can be used under certain circumstances to recover
topological structure embedded in realistic fMRI data simulations.How do we
represent the world? In cognitive neuroscience it is typical to think
representations are points in high-dimensional space. In order to study these
kinds of spaces it is necessary to have tools that capture the organization of
high- dimensional data. Topological data analysis (TDA) holds promise for
detecting unique types of geometric features in patterns of data. Although
potentially useful, TDA has not been applied to event-related fMRI data. Here
we utilized a popular tool from TDA, persistent homology, to recover
topological signals from event-related fMRI data. We simulated realistic fMRI
data and explored the parameters under which persistent homology can
successfully extract signal. We also provided extensive code and
recommendations for how to make the most out of TDA for fMRI analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;China’s first Mars rover is taking in the view of its new home. The Zhurong rover touched down on the Red Planet on May 14, and its first images reached Earth on May 19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zhurong, named for an ancient Chinese god of fire, has been orbiting the Red Planet since February 10, when China’s Tianwen-1 spacecraft entered Martian orbit. The rover landed in a vast plain called Utopia Planitia — also where NASA’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/viking-2s-view-utopia-rock-strewn-martian-plain&quot;&gt;Viking 2 lander touched down in 1976&lt;/a&gt;, although Viking 2’s site was much farther north (&lt;em&gt;SN:  9/11/76&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The orbiter and rover together mark China’s first Mars mission and make China only the second country to successfully land a rover there. China has previously landed two rovers on the moon, named Yutu and Yutu-2, with the Chang’e-3 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-change4-first-spacecraft-lands-moon-farside&quot;&gt;Chang’e-4 missions&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/3/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
 
&lt;/div&gt;The Tianwen-1 orbiter captured a video of the lander and rover separating from the orbiter before plunging into the Martian atmosphere.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike NASA’s Perseverance rover, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down&quot;&gt;landed on Mars in February&lt;/a&gt; and beamed photos back almost immediately (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/17/21&lt;/em&gt;), Zhurong took a few days to send its first glimpses of the Martian surface back to Earth. That’s because the rover had to wait for the Tianwen-1 orbiter to move into a lower orbit to allow it to relay more data between Mars and Earth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image of the rover’s solar panels and antenna&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099774&quot; height=&quot;680&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/051921_lg_chinarover_inline1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099774&quot;&gt;This image was taken with Zhurong’s rear navigation camera. It shows the rover’s solar panels and antenna.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099774&quot;&gt;CNSA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first images are from Zhurong’s hazard avoidance and navigation cameras. For now, the rover is still perched atop its landing platform. After several days looking around and checking out its instruments, Zhurong will roll down the lander’s ramps and onto the Martian soil, possibly on May 21 or 22, according to a report from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-05/15/c_139947277.htm&quot;&gt;China’s state-run Xinhua news agency after the landing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zhurong will spend at least three months studying the geology at Utopia Planitia and searching for water ice beneath the surface. The rover carries a ground-penetrating radar that can help distinguish between rock and ice beneath the surface, similar to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-moon-rover-revealed-what-lies-beneath-lunar-farside-surface&quot;&gt;technique used by the Yutu-2 rover on the moon&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/26/20&lt;/em&gt;).  It also carries an instrument to analyze surface chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Tianwen-1 orbiter will remain active for a full Martian year (about 687 Earth days), observing the ground from space with a high-resolution camera.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Winter usually kills most forest fires. But in the boreal woods that encircle the far North, some fires, like zombies, just don’t die. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first broad scientific look at overwintering “zombie fires” reveals these rare occurrences can flare up the year after warmer-than-normal summers and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03437-y&quot;&gt;account for up to 38 percent of the total burn area&lt;/a&gt; in some regions, researchers report online May 19 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-arctic-browning&quot;&gt;climate change accelerates in boreal forests&lt;/a&gt;, the frequency of zombie fires could rise and exacerbate warming by releasing more greenhouse gases from the region’s soils, which may house &lt;a href=&quot;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008GB003327&quot;&gt;twice as much carbon&lt;/a&gt; as Earth’s atmosphere (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/11/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zombie fires hibernate underground. Blanketed by snow, they smolder through the cold, surviving on the carbon-rich fuel of peat and boreal soil and moving very slowly — just 100 to 500 meters over the winter. Come spring, the fires reemerge near the forest they previously charred, burning fresh fuel well before the traditional fire season starts. Until now, these zombie fires have remained relatively mysterious to science, known mostly from firefighter anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Strange coincidences on satellite images, however, got the attention of earth systems scientist Rebecca Scholten and her colleagues. “My adviser noticed that some years, new fires were starting very close to the previous year’s fire,” says Scholten, of Vrije University Amsterdam. This is unusual, she says, since boreal fires are usually sparked by random lightning or human activity. Local fire managers confirmed that these were the same fires, prompting the researchers to wonder just how often fires overwinter.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;To find evidence of underground fires, the researchers combined firefighter reports with satellite images of Alaska and northern Canada captured from 2002 to 2018. They looked for blazes that started close to the scars left the previous year and that began before midsummer, when lightning-sparked fires usually occur.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that zombie fires are rare, accounting for 0.8 percent of the total area burned by forest fires in these regions over those 16 years, but there was lots of variability. In 2008, one zombie fire burned approximately 13,700 hectares in Alaska, about 38 percent of all burned areas that year in that state. Zombie fires were more likely to occur, and burn larger swaths of land, after warmer summers that allowed fires to reach deeper into the soil, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Back from the dead&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zombie fires persist underground through winter, emerging the next spring near the previous year’s burn. Here, the area burned by a 2015 Alaska forest fire is outlined in a satellite image. The fire went dormant that winter (shown in April 2016), and reemerged in May 2016 close to the old burn scar (outlined).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boreal forests are warming faster that the global average and “we’re seeing more hot summers and more large fires and intense burning,” Scholten says. That might set the stage for zombie fires to play a bigger role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a really welcome advance which could help fire management,” says Jessica McCarty, a geographer at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, who wasn’t involved in the study. Understanding when zombie fires are more likely to occur could help firefighters identify these areas early, she says, protecting fragile landscapes that house a lot of climate warming gases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Some of these soils are thousands of years old,” McCarty says. While “areas we thought were fire resistant are now fire prone” due to climate change, she says, better fire management can make a difference. “We’re not helpless.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mouse-mammal-brains-circuits-control-tongues-limbs"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Precise control of the tongue is often vital in life, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-gives-frog-tongues-gift-grab&quot;&gt;the way frogs capture flies&lt;/a&gt; to human speech (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/31/17&lt;/em&gt;). But much remains unknown about how the brain controls the tongue, given how its quick motions are difficult to track. Now, experiments show that the brain circuits in mice that help the tongue lick water may be the same ones &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03561-9&quot;&gt;that help primates reach out to grasp objects&lt;/a&gt;, scientists report online May 19 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using high-speed video, neuroscientist Tejapratap Bollu and colleagues recorded the sides and bottoms of mouse tongues as the rodents drank from a waterspout. With the help of artificial intelligence to develop 3-D simulations of the appendages, the researchers discovered that successful licks required previously unknown corrective movements, too fast to be seen in standard video. These adjustments came after the tongue missed unseen or distant droplets, or when the spout was unexpectedly retracted a millimeter or more. Inhibiting a brain region that controls the body’s voluntary motions impaired these corrections, suggesting this brain area was behind these movements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These newfound corrective motions are similar to ones that primates use when reaching out with their limbs for uncertain targets, the researchers say. Those primate adjustments are also controlled by similar brain circuits as those used by the mice. “This to me shows that mammalian brains use similar principles to control the tongue and the limb,” says Bollu, now at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif. “Everything we know about reaching in the primates can also be used to understand how the brain controls [tongue] movements.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future research with X-ray and MRI scans could show how the brain controls tongue movements associated with chewing and swallowing, which could have clinical applications, Bollu says. The methods used in this work, he notes, could also help yield insights on other muscly appendages, such as elephant trunks and octopus arms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<id>https://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=42159</id>
		<updated>2021-05-19T10:57:14+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three people are walking down the street, two women and one man. One of the women trips and falls. Which of the two observers will feel more empathy for her pain? Hundreds of studies suggest that it’ll be the woman. However, these results almost overwhelmingly come from self-reports. Objective evidence that women genuinely feel more empathy than men is very thin on the ground. This has led to the idea that women report more empathy not because they actually feel it but to conform to societal expectations that they should. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87214-x&quot;&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; claims to provide evidence that, even when they think no one else is looking or asking, girls show more empathy than boys.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42159&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Joyce F Benenson at the University of Quebec and colleagues set up pairs of 5- to 7-year-old children, so that one member of the pair would suffer a misfortune, and the other would witness it. The members of each of the 32 female pairs and 23 male pairs knew each other, but weren’t considered by their teachers to be best friends or enemies. (The researchers sex-matched the pairs because earlier studies have suggested that we feel more empathy for people of the same sex — so any sex difference in empathy should be easier to spot.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each pair was taken to a room in their own school. It was empty but for two baskets of plastic building blocks by the entrance, and a table at the far end. The children were asked if they’d be willing to take the blocks to the table and build a tower. (The somewhat elaborate full story involved alien children who needed to contact their parents; the children all seemed to want to take part, the researchers report.) Before leaving the room, the experimenter did warn them that one basket was a little broken, so if a child found that their blocks fell, they should just pick up them up with their hands and carry them over to the table. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hidden cameras then recorded what happened when the researchers remote-operated one of the baskets to split, causing that child’s bricks to tumble out. The team focused on the other child’s reactions, and rated them according to four “empathy indicators”: looking at the victim for more than three seconds; ceasing their own activity for longer than a second; ceasing their activity until the other child had placed a block on the tower; and actively intervening by picking up the basket or blocks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eight of the girls, and none of the boys, engaged in all four behaviours (though seven girls and five boys did not engage in any at all). Overall, significantly more girls than boys looked at the victim for more than three seconds and gave them chance to recover before placing their own block. The female bystanders “exhibited more empathic behaviour than male bystanders”, the team concluded, adding: “It is highly likely that females do experience greater feelings of empathy which motivate them to behave in ways that display more concern for victims.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is possible. It could be that, as the researchers argue, they have found behavioural indicators of sex differences in empathy. But there are other potential explanations. It might be that girls are more patient than boys, or more agreeable (there is research finding that girls and women tend to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Overlapping-distributions-of-Agreeableness-for-men-and-women-Vertical-axis-indicates_fig10_51594567&quot;&gt;score higher on this personality trait&lt;/a&gt; than males), or that the boys were more competitive and prioritised getting on with building over acting on whatever empathy they felt for their partner. In fact, the majority of boys did pause whatever they were doing following the accident. Most didn’t show other “empathic activities”, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they weren’t feeling the same empathy for their unlucky partners as the girls. Perhaps girls really do feel more empathy, but it’s not possible to conclude that from this study.       &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87214-x&quot;&gt;Girls exhibit greater empathy than boys following a minor accident&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;Red sign with slogan 'Keep calm and stay home'&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12397 alignright&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/30140872-278x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;246&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;In an interesting analysis, researchers from Technical University in Munich and the University of Cambridge investigated the difference in the response to COVID-19 pandemic between Germany and UK residents. Their findings (published now in &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychology&lt;/em&gt;) highlight a striking discrepancy how responders from both countries rated the impact of the pandemic on their financial situation as well as their personal outlook: While German participants reported a lower impact in terms of loss of work and income, they were less hopeful that the pandemic would end soon compared with British participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, both populations showed an increase in symptoms of mental illnesses, most prominently depression and anxieties, induced or worsened by the pandemic. This alarming increase calls for a better public awareness of mental health and mental illness as well as better access to help in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comparison between Germany and the UK is particularly interesting because both countries are economically and culturally very similar. However, the initial response to the pandemic differed between both countries, with Germany locking down considerably earlier than the UK, which has been shown to have impacted number of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the data for this study was collected during the first lockdown in both countries (April/May 2020) it will be interesting to see how the mental health response has changed over the course of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-021-00620-8?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Medical Ethics – Research integrity, misconduct and consequences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Research ethics is a hot topic not only in the science community but is also garnering wide-spread attention among the public. Especially in recent years, cases of prominent researchers suspected of misconduct have been highly publicised across news outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12396&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12396 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-1033540402-1-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;© Warchi / Getty Images / iStock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;In a recent study published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Ethics&lt;/em&gt;, researchers from Hungary, Ireland, the UK and Norway collected and analysed data concerning cases of research misconduct available in scientific journals. Interestingly, the field of natural sciences (41.5%) was found to have the most cases in relation to number of publications in the field, followed by health and medical sciences (25.1%) and engineering (22%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The most prevalent misconduct category was fabrication and falsification of data with non-adherence to pertinent laws such as informed consent and ethics approval ranking second. Additionally, the researchers assessed the consequences for research misconduct finding paper retraction (45.4%) and exclusion from funding applications (35.5%) to be the most common sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The authors of this study further criticise that retraction notices often do not contain sufficient detail, thus impeding transparency of the retraction process. Comprehensive analyses such as this study guide the research community in finding ways to prevent misconduct and upholding research integrity standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01268-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Medical Research Methodology – Equity in clinical trial registration – Why are places of higher disease prevalence not (yet) aligned with trial locations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Clinical trials aimed to investigate treatment options for specific illnesses often do not recruit from populations with high prevalence of the respective disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12398&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Group of healthcare workers and patients of different ages and ethnicities in a huddle all with hands in smiling at the hospital.&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12398&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-1141832721-1-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;© Hispanolistic / Getty Images / iStock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;This geographical mismatch affects both the quality of care and the validity or generalisability of results and funding bodies are working towards a more equal distribution. Researchers and funding bodies are becoming increasingly aware of these issues, prompting researchers from the University of Oxford to investigate why this mismatch exists and how chief investigators (CIs) of clinical trials can be supported to achieve a more equitable distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The results of their qualitative study have now been published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Medical Research Methodology&lt;/em&gt; revealing that the main factors in site selection for CIs is to ensure a successful trial procedure and the risk associated with choosing less research-active sites. Mainly, CIs are conscious of potential issues with patient recruitment and retention and are concerned with the effect a less successful trial might have on their reputation and future funding opportunities. This often leads to CIs selecting sites where they have a personal contact or with which they have collaborated in the past, thereby perpetuating this system of inequity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The authors suggest strategies to mitigate these perceived risk factors and incentivise chief investigators to align their research sites with the location of disease prevalence while highlighting the benefits experienced by CIs who have previously ‘broken the mould’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-021-05552-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMC Research Notes – Reforesting our planet using nitrogen-fixing legumes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Awareness of the importance of the tropical rain forests and forests in general for our global climate has grown over the last few years and forest restoration is crucial in our efforts to prevent a climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Reforestation programmes are on the rise, but a main hindrance to restoring a diverse plant life are often depleted soils that have lost nutrients and minerals through monocultural farming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12399&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Hand of a farmer nurturing a young green plant with natural green background .&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-12399&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/iStock-614115058-1-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;© weerapatkiatdumrong / Getty Images / iStock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Brazilian researchers present data on the use of different legume plants in restoration efforts, published now in &lt;em&gt;BMC Research Notes&lt;/em&gt;. Nitrogen-fixing legumes are a useful tool to restore soils and offer a good basis for second-generation plants, but the process is often slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By measuring biomass growth of reforestation blocks treated with different fertilisation regimens, the researchers were able to show a fundamental role for additional fertilisation during the early stages of plantation development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings will be important for policymakers in setting up strategies to mitigate global warming and retrieve carbon from our atmosphere using natural fixation by plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder leading to learning disabilities or social dysfunction in affected children with symptoms often lasting into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Previous research has shown that children with ADHD often have lower serum levels of vitamin D and magnesium, but few studies have been conducted to assess the effect of vitamin D/magnesium supplementation on behavioural issues of children diagnosed with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;In a study published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt; Hemamy and colleagues present data from a randomised, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of vitamin D/Mg supplementation on Iranian children with ADHD. Interestingly, the researchers find significant improvement in several behavioural variables including emotional and peer problems, where children in the treatment group scored significantly better than those receiving a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;This research lays the groundwork for bigger clinical trials investigating the impact of vitamin D and magnesium on the behaviour of children with ADHD as well as the underlying physiological mechanism leading to potentially new treatment recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/european-fire-ant-chemicals-spider-repellent-webs-homes"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3099741</id>
		<updated>2021-05-18T23:01:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;To make a spider flee, bring on the fire ants. Or rather, just their chemical signals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some spiders common in North American homes &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.210279&quot;&gt;avoid building their webs in chambers that recently housed European fire ants&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report May 19 in &lt;em&gt;Royal Society Open Science&lt;/em&gt;. The ants probably left behind chemical traces, the researchers say. That could signal danger to the arachnids because ants sometimes feast on spiders. The reaction hints that the insects might be a source of natural spider-repelling chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people are afraid of spiders, and there’s nothing on the market that is reliable that keeps the spiders away,” says Andreas Fischer, an arachnologist at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fischer and his colleagues housed false black widow spiders (&lt;em&gt;Steatoda grossa&lt;/em&gt;) in a glass container with three connected chambers. The arachnids were less likely to settle down in empty compartments that had once contained European fire ants (&lt;em&gt;Myrmica rubra&lt;/em&gt;), an invasive species in North America. Other spider species — black widow (&lt;em&gt;Latrodectus hesperus&lt;/em&gt;), cross (&lt;em&gt;Araneus diadematus&lt;/em&gt;) and hobo (&lt;em&gt;Eratigena agrestis&lt;/em&gt;) — also had an aversion to the former fire ant chambers. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The finding is exciting but not ready for real-world use, Fischer says. “I really hope that people don’t go out there and get European fire ants into their garden to get rid of spiders.” The ants are aggressive, “horrendous pests” with stinging bites and are tough to get rid of. Another type of fire ant (&lt;em&gt;Solenopsis invicta&lt;/em&gt;) native to South America is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/invasive-species-cost-billions-damages-global-economy&quot;&gt;among the costliest invasive species in the world&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/31/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team plans to pinpoint what chemical spooks the spiders and figure out if it can be made in the lab. Then the researchers will make sure the potential spider repellent is not toxic or a homing beacon for ants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s the last thing we want, that we get rid of spiders but attract ants,” Fischer says. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title type="html" xml:lang="en-US">Climate change disinformation is evolving. So are efforts to fight back</title>
		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-disinformation-denial-misinformation"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3099625</id>
		<updated>2021-05-18T13:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Over the last four decades, a highly organized, well-funded campaign powered by the fossil fuel industry has sought to discredit the science that links global climate change to human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. These disinformation efforts have sown confusion over data, questioned the integrity of climate scientists and denied the scientific consensus on the role of humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such disinformation efforts are outlined in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/07/The-Climate-Deception-Dossiers.pdf&quot;&gt;internal documents&lt;/a&gt; from fossil fuel giants such as Shell and Exxon. As early as the 1980s, oil companies knew that burning fossil fuels was altering the climate, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=110126&quot;&gt;industry documents reviewed&lt;/a&gt; at a 2019 U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform hearing. Yet these companies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/&quot;&gt;aided by some scientists&lt;/a&gt;, set out to mislead the public, deny well-established science and forestall efforts to regulate emissions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-wildfires-heat-waves-hurricanes-records-2020&quot;&gt;effects of climate change on extreme events&lt;/a&gt; such as wildfires, heat waves and hurricanes have become hard to downplay (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/19/20 &amp;amp; SN: 1/2/21, p. 37&lt;/em&gt;). Not coincidentally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-climate-war-book-exposes-tactics-climate-change-inactivists&quot;&gt;climate disinformation tactics have shifted&lt;/a&gt; from outright denial to distraction and delay (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/16/21, p. 28&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As disinformation tactics evolve, researchers continue to test new ways to combat them. Debunking by fact-checking untrue statements is one way to combat climate disinformation. Another way, increasingly adopted by social media platforms, is to add warning labels flagging messages as possible disinformation, such as the labels Twitter and Facebook (which also owns Instagram) began adding in 2020 regarding the U.S. presidential election and the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Facebook was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/warren-carper-whitehouse-schatz-call-on-mark-zuckerberg-and-facebook-to-stop-the-deliberate-spread-of-climate-disinformation-on-the-companys-social-media-platforms&quot;&gt;sharply criticized for a change to its fact-checking policies&lt;/a&gt; that critics say enables the spread of climate disinformation. In 2019, the social media giant decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-to-create-fact-checking-exemptions-for-opinion-and-satire-11569875314&quot;&gt;exempt posts that it determines to be opinion or satire from fact-checking&lt;/a&gt;, creating a potentially large disinformation loophole.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response to mounting criticism, Facebook unveiled a pilot project in February for its users in the United Kingdom, with labels pointing out myths about climate change. The labels also point users to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/climatescienceinfo&quot;&gt;Facebook’s climate science information center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For this project, Facebook consulted several climate communication experts. Sander van der Linden, a social psychologist at the University of Cambridge, and cognitive scientist John Cook of George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., helped the company develop a new “myth-busting” unit that debunks common climate change myths — such as that scientists don’t agree that global warming is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers John Cook and Sander van der Linden hope to inoculate people against climate change denial messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cook and van der Linden have also been testing ways to get out in front of disinformation, an approach known as prebunking, or inoculation theory. By helping people recognize common rhetorical techniques used to spread climate disinformation — such as logical fallacies, relying on fake “experts” and cherry-picking only the data that support one view — the two hope to build resilience against these tactics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This new line of defense may come with a bonus, van der Linden says. Training people in these techniques could build a more general resilience to disinformation, whether related to climate, vaccines or COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt; asked Cook and van der Linden about debunking conspiracies, collaborating with Facebook and how prebunking is (and isn’t) like getting vaccinated. The conversations, held separately, have been edited for brevity and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve seen both misinformation and disinformation used in the climate change denial discussion. What’s the difference?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;van der Linden: Misinformation is any information that’s incorrect, whether due to error or fake news. Disinformation is deliberately intended to deceive. Then there’s propaganda: disinformation with a political agenda. But in practice, it’s difficult to disentangle them. Often, people use misinformation because it’s the broadest category.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has there been a change in the nature of climate change denialism in the last few decades?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cook: It is shifting. For example, we fed &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/crxfm&quot;&gt;21 years of [climate change] denial blog posts&lt;/a&gt; from the U.K. into a machine learning program. We found that the science denialism misinformation is gradually going down — and solution misinformation [targeting climate policy and renewable energy] is on the rise [as reported online in early March at SocArXiv.org].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the science becomes more apparent, it becomes more untenable to attack it. We see spikes in policy misinformation just before the government brings in new science policy, such as a carbon pricing bill. And there was a huge spike before the [2015] &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/195-nations-approve-historic-climate-accord&quot;&gt;Paris climate agreement&lt;/a&gt;. That’s what we will see more of over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you hope Facebook’s new climate change misinformation project will help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cook: We need tech solutions, like flagging and tagging misinformation, as well as social media platforms downplaying it, so [the misinformation] doesn’t get put on as many people’s feeds. We can’t depend on social media. A look behind the curtain at Facebook showed me the challenge of getting corporations to adequately respond. There are a lot of internal tensions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;van der Linden: I’ve worked with WhatsApp and Google, and it’s always the same story. They want to do the right thing, but don’t follow through because it hurts engagement on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But going from not taking a stance on climate change to taking a stance, that’s a huge win. What Facebook has done is a step forward. They listened to our designs and suggestions and comments on their [pilot] test.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We wanted more than a neutral [label directing people to Facebook’s information page on climate change], but they wanted to test the neutral post first. That’s all good. It’ll be a few months at least for the testing in the U.K. phase to roll out, but we don’t yet know how many other countries they will roll it out to and when. We all came on board with the idea that they’re going to do more, and more aggressively. I’ll be pleasantly surprised if it rolls out globally. That’s my criteria for success.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists have been countering climate change misinformation for years, through fact-checking and debunking. It’s a bit like whack-a-mole. You advocate for “inoculating” people against the techniques that help misinformation spread through communities. How can that help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;van der Linden: Fact-checking and debunking is useful if you do it right. But there’s the issue of ideology, of resistance to fact-checking when it’s not in line with ideology. Wouldn’t life be so much easier if we could prevent [disinformation] in the first place? That’s the whole point of prebunking or inoculation. It’s a multilayer defense system. If you can get there first, that’s great. But that won’t always be possible, so you still have real-time fact-checking. This multilayer firewall is going to be the most useful thing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve both developed online interactive tools, games really, to test the idea of inoculating people against disinformation tactics. Sander, you created an online interactive game called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getbadnews.com/#intro&quot;&gt;Bad News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, in which players can invent conspiracies and act as fake news producers. A study of 15,000 participants reported in 2019 in &lt;em&gt;Palgrave Communications&lt;/em&gt; showed that by playing at creating misinformation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0279-9&quot;&gt;people got better at recognizing it&lt;/a&gt;. But how long does this “inoculation” last?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;van der Linden: That’s an important difference in the viral analogy. Biological vaccines give more or less lifelong immunity, at least for some kinds of viruses. That’s not the case for a psychological vaccine. It wears off over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one study, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-70597-001&quot;&gt;followed up with people [repeatedly] for about three months&lt;/a&gt;, during which time they didn’t replay the game. We found no decay of the inoculation effect, which was quite surprising. The inoculation remained stable for about two months. In [a shorter study focused on] climate change misinformation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2020.101455&quot;&gt;the inoculation effect also remained stable&lt;/a&gt;, for at least one week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John, what about your game &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://crankyuncle.com/&quot;&gt;Cranky Uncle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;? At first, it focused on climate change denial, but you’ve expanded it to include other types of misinformation, on topics such as COVID-19, flat-earthism and vaccine misinformation. How well do techniques to inoculate against climate change denialism translate to other types of misinformation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cook: The techniques used in climate denial are seen in all forms of misinformation. Working on deconstructing [that] misinformation introduced me to parallel argumentation, which is basically using analogies to combat flawed logic. That’s what late night comedians do: Make what is obviously a ridiculous argument. The other night, for example, Seth Meyers talked about how Texas blaming its [February] power outage on renewable energy was like New Jersey blaming its problems on Boston [clam chowder].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My main tip is to arm yourself with awareness of misleading techniques. Think of it like a virus spreading: You don’t want to be a superspreader. Make sure that you’re wearing a mask, for starters. And when you see misinformation, call it out. That observational correction — it matters. It makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3099679</id>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;As restaurants, bars, businesses and schools reopen and mask requirements drop for the fully vaccinated, some people are asking how to bring in customers and students while still preventing COVID-19 infections from spreading. Some scientists and engineers are doing research that may help clear the air, making it safer for everyone to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though no one solution works for all places, public spaces need to focus on proper ventilation, air filtration, germicidal ultraviolet lights and air quality monitoring rather than rigorously disinfecting surfaces, say many scientists who cite evidence that the virus lingers in the air.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is what’s really frustrating,” says Jose-Luis Jimenez, an aerosol scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder. “We’ve wasted billions and billions of dollars on disinfecting, which doesn’t serve any purpose whatsoever, yet things like having a $50 filter in every classroom, we haven’t done.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have &lt;a href=&quot;https://events.ucalgary.ca/obrien/#!view/event/event_id/306929&quot;&gt;hotly debated&lt;/a&gt; whether SARS-CoV-2 counts as an airborne virus. While some researchers maintain that coronavirus can be picked up from infected saliva droplets that have landed on surfaces, many others counter that the possibility is a slim one. Touching a contaminated surface has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/science-and-research/surface-transmission.html&quot;&gt;1 in 10,000 chance&lt;/a&gt; of causing an infection, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So, handwashing and standard cleaning practices are probably enough to eliminate any coronavirus that lands on surfaces or strays to hands.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;A wealth of data now suggests that COVID-19 is spread mainly through inhaling fine aerosol particles that can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n913&quot;&gt;hang in the air for hours&lt;/a&gt;, researchers argue in separate publications that appear online April 14 in the &lt;em&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/em&gt; and in the May 1 &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00869-2/fulltext&quot;&gt;Ten lines of scientific evidence support airborne transmission&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; report says, and little data favor droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces as the primary way the virus is spread. On April 30, the World Health Organization updated its transmission information to acknowledge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-is-it-transmitted&quot;&gt;aerosols as a source of spread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Learning how to clean the air of potentially virus-laden aerosols could have long-term benefits for health and allow businesses and schools to remain open during future outbreaks. That’s promising because though COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are falling in the United States thanks to vaccinations, mask wearing and people moving outside as the weather warms, the virus is still spreading widely in some places. On May 13, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its recommendations saying that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html&quot;&gt;fully vaccinated people no longer have to wear masks&lt;/a&gt;, except where required by federal, state, local or tribal requirements, including business or workplace guidelines. It’s not yet known if or how that will affect cases, though some researchers predict the coronavirus will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-cases-deaths-prediction-summer-winter-surge&quot;&gt;make a comeback as people congregate inside&lt;/a&gt; in the fall and winter, which may require masking up again (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/23/21&lt;/em&gt;). Air cleansing strategies may help stop the resurgence, as well as prevent flu, colds and many other illnesses, including possible future pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Indoor air ought to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6543/689&quot;&gt;regulated for infection control&lt;/a&gt;, much like food and water are, air experts propose in the May 14 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. Indoor air has mainly been conditioned to control odors and temperature, but systems should be upgraded to strip out pathogens, too, the scientists say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Knocking respiratory viruses out of circulation wouldn’t just improve health, it would also be good for the bottom line. In the United States alone, yearly economic losses from flu total $11.2 billion, and other respiratory viruses cost about $40 billion. COVID-19’s global monthly harm is estimated to be $1 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There needs to be a shift in the perception that we cannot afford the cost of control, because economic costs of infections can be massive and may exceed initial infrastructure costs to contain them,” the scientists wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt; spoke to several researchers who shared tips about easy ways to clean the air, how to gauge whether those steps are working and what to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Ventilation&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cleansing the air is mostly a matter of proper ventilation and filtration. The equipment needed to do those things has been around for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have the tools. We have the knowledge,” says Charles Haas, an environmental engineer at Drexel University in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ventilation replaces stale indoor air with fresh air from outside, which dilutes the concentration of any virus that’s present. Simply circulating air with fans isn’t enough, Haas says. “If all you’re doing is moving around dirty air, the net effect is not going to be beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most experts recommend completely replacing all the air in a room six times every hour. That’s about average for many schools, offices and nursing homes, says Nora Wang Esram, senior director for research at the Washington, D.C.–based nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. Hospitals often exceed that level of ventilation. Homes are among the least-ventilated places where people spend their time, with some exchanging air only once every two hours, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Getting proper ventilation might be as easy as opening a window or turning up the fan on a heating and cooling unit. But there are trade-offs in increased energy costs, Esram warns. “Generally, we say increase ventilation, which means your fan has to run faster. Open up the damper and bring in more fresh air. Put in a filter. But there is a limit, and a balance. It’s not like you can maximize everything at once,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, opening a window might be fine on breezy, balmy days. But when it’s scorching hot or freezing cold out, during allergy season or when wildfires or pollution make breathing outdoor air dangerous, windows aren’t an option. In that case, a building’s heating, ventilation and air conditioning, or HVAC, system may be a good — if not better — substitute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Germany tested how cross-ventilation from two open windows performed against an HVAC system for clearing aerosol particles from a university lecture hall. In the winter, drafts of cold air from the open windows quickly made conditions in the lecture hall unpleasantly chilly. People would need to repeatedly&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.17.21253800v1&quot;&gt; open the windows for 10 minutes and close them for five minutes&lt;/a&gt; to perform similarly to the HVAC system, which did six air changes per hour and kept temperatures comfy, the researchers report March 20 at medRxiv.org. The work is preliminary and hasn’t been reviewed by other scientists yet. But in this case, the HVAC was the winner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In many places, including office buildings, hotels and stores, windows don’t open. There, the heating and cooling system is the only option for dumping stale air and bringing in fresh outside air. Many modern buildings already have HVAC systems that provide proper ventilation, says Martin Bazant, a physicist and chemical engineer at MIT who developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://indoor-covid-safety.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;a tool&lt;/a&gt; to help people calculate how much ventilation they need for their space.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s going on in a room &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/17/e2018995118&quot;&gt;makes a big difference&lt;/a&gt; in how much virus may need to be cleared from the air, Bazant and MIT colleague John Bush, an applied mathematician, report April 27 in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;. “An interesting bit of science that has developed over the last year … is the strong dependence on vocalization [for] aerosol generation,” Bazant says. “For instance, just breathing heavily while exercising doesn’t generate that many more droplets. It’s really coming from your vocal chords.” Speaking or singing generate more aerosol particles, and the louder the sound, the more aerosols are generated. So, a choir room would need more ventilation than the school library where people are sitting quietly.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;Filtration&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another wrinkle to consider: Increasing ventilation in one room may &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132321000457?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;carry infectious viruses into connected rooms through HVAC vents&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report in the June 15 &lt;em&gt;Building and Environment&lt;/em&gt;. Central heat and air handling systems that serve multiple rooms are common in schools, strip malls, residential and office buildings, says coauthor Timothy Salsbury, a mechanical engineer at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash. If a person with COVID-19 were in one room and the HVAC were turned off, infectious virus particles would stay in that room, he says. “As soon as you start adding air flow to the space, you move the virus from the infected room to the uninfected [connecting] room.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that’s where filtration comes in. Experts recommend filtering air through materials that can trap airborne particles containing the virus. Such devices include HEPA filters or furnace and air conditioner filters with a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value, or MERV, rating of 13. (MERV ratings range from 1 to 16. The higher the number, the more effectively the filter can catch small particles.) Ramping up filtration to pull the coronavirus out of the air can be a good substitute for increasing ventilation, Jimenez says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most new buildings in the United States follow building codes that require filters rated MERV8 or higher. But many older buildings have HVAC systems that can’t handle higher level filters, which have more resistance and require more pressure to push air through, Esram says. “If the pressure builds up [too much], it’s going to damage your HVAC system,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If buildings can’t handle extra filtration at the central unit and building owners can’t afford to upgrade the HVAC system, portable air-purifying machines may help. Many small units that can filter the air in a room are available. Among the best are high-efficiency particulate absorbing filters, better known as HEPA filters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HEPA filters effectively remove viruses, pollen, dust, bacteria and other particles from the air. Some units can be expensive, Esram says, and they tend to move air slowly, effectively reducing the number of air changes per hour. Some large rooms, or rooms where lots of people congregate, such as classrooms, may need several units.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study in the Netherlands found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7711180/&quot;&gt;HEPA units cleared the air&lt;/a&gt; of bubbles standing in for coronavirus-carrying aerosols better than open windows and doors did. But study participants said the units were too noisy and created bothersome drafts, the researchers reported in the Jan. 15 &lt;em&gt;Building and Environment&lt;/em&gt;. Some restaurants are experimenting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/interactive/2021/indoor-air-quality-safety-experiment/&quot;&gt;tabletop filters&lt;/a&gt; that can suck in diners’ exhalations and send the filtered air skyward instead of toward a dining companion’s face.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many people have the mistaken idea that air purifying equipment has to be high tech and expensive to be effective, says Marwa Zaatari, a building scientist with expertise in indoor air quality and a partner at D Zine Partners, a Texas-based company that designs indoor air quality systems. All you really need is a fan and a filter, she says. Well, five filters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.texairfilters.com/a-variation-on-the-box-fan-with-merv-13-filter-air-cleaner/&quot;&gt;Corsi boxes&lt;/a&gt;, named after environmental engineer Richard Corsi of Portland State University in Oregon, consist of cubes made of five MERV filters with a box fan as the sixth side. The DIY filtration unit is a relatively low-cost alternative that even tenants who don’t control their building’s central HVAC system can use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright size-medium&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A Corsi box&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099786&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/051921_ti_covid-air_corsibox_rev-432x383.jpg&quot; width=&quot;432&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099786&quot;&gt;A Corsi box (pictured) is a low-cost, DIY indoor air filtration solution that consists of one box fan plus five filters arranged in a cube.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099786&quot;&gt;Courtesy of Tex-Air Filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Filters will remove viruses from the air over the long term, but unless there is a filter between two people it won’t stop short-range virus transmission, Bazant says. That’s why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic&quot;&gt;masks are important&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/12/21&lt;/em&gt;). If both people are wearing masks, it’s like having two filters, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Restaurants and bars have an extra challenge in the filtration department because patrons don’t wear masks while they eat and drink. And lingering over dinner can create a cloud of particles that other diners can breathe in, says Kimberly Prather, an aerosol scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. The longer people spend in potentially virus-laden air, the higher the infection risk, she says. “It’s all about time. It’s not just a whiff” as people pass on the street.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Monitoring&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How can diners, store patrons, students and teachers know whether they are breathing safe air? There are no guarantees, but Jimenez, Prather and other experts think the United States should take cues from other countries and post carbon dioxide levels outside businesses and classrooms as a proxy for air freshness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People breathe out CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; all the time. In fact, every exhaled breath is about 4 percent carbon dioxide, Jimenez says. (The rest is &lt;a href=&quot;https://sciencing.com/chemical-composition-exhaled-air-human-lungs-11795.html&quot;&gt;mainly nitrogen and oxygen&lt;/a&gt;, but may contain small amounts of thousands of other compounds.) Without proper ventilation, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels build up. And that’s not good at all, Jimenez says. “We get dumber when there is high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,” he says. Studies have shown that student performance suffers and people have trouble making decisions as carbon dioxide levels rise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Worse, high carbon dioxide levels mean a higher chance that “the air you breathe in has already been in somebody else’s lungs,” Jimenez says. “You don’t want your lungs to touch the air that has been touched by other lungs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Outside, the air people breathe is quickly diluted. Out of every million molecules of outside air, about 400 are carbon dioxide — a concentration of 400 parts per million. Ideally, indoor air shouldn’t get much above 700 parts per million of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Jimenez says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed alignright is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;

This week they had switched off the fan at the front door blowing air back in and had the back door open, creating a through draught.&lt;br /&gt;They were really stoked and… &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/GlmVpCVqiA&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/GlmVpCVqiA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— CO2 Guerrillas (@CO2Guerrillas) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CO2Guerrillas/status/1346347767669485568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;An Australian group called CO2Guerrillas tweets carbon dioxide readings to raise awareness about poor air quality. Small CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monitors (one pictured) in public spaces could help visitors assess how well the air is ventilated.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A portable carbon dioxide monitor can cue people in to whether the store or movie theater they’re walking into has enough ventilation. But it’s not a perfect measure, Jimenez stresses. Filtered air may be a bit stuffy, but would have lower infection risks than unfiltered air. And activities, such as an exercise class or choir practice, in a room may produce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels similar to other situations, but carry &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.1c00183&quot;&gt;100 times the infection risk&lt;/a&gt;, he and University of Colorado colleague Zhe Peng reported online April 5 in &lt;em&gt;Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology Letters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Sterilization&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some companies have proposed spraying chemical disinfectants that could kill the virus in the air, Esram says. One proposal would release a fog of the chemicals into a movie theater to sanitize the air. That might be fine when people aren’t there. But it wouldn’t help with the cloud of aerosols moviegoers constantly emit when they breathe, cheer, laugh or gasp at the antics on screen. “Nobody wants to get sprayed down while they’re eating their popcorn,” Esram says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is a sterilizing technique that could be used while people are in the room, Prather says. Germicidal ultraviolet light may zap the virus and kill it in the air. At least ultraviolet-C radiation has been shown to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/uv-lights-and-lamps-ultraviolet-c-radiation-disinfection-and-coronavirus&quot;&gt;destroy the outer protein coat of the original SARS virus&lt;/a&gt;. No one knows exactly how much UV-C is needed to inactivate SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, UV-C lights installed in the upper parts of rooms and shielded from people’s eyes may kill lingering viruses and bacteria, making air safer, Prather says. “But you can do it wrong,” she says. Such systems need to be installed by professionals and can be costly. Still, properly installed germicidal UV lights can help protect against a variety of pathogens, not only SARS-CoV-2.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all UV lights are created equal, though. Consumers should beware of UV photocatalytic oxidation, or PCO, lamps, says Zaatari, the Texas building scientist. Those lamps shine UV light on a catalyst to create chemicals, which can kill pathogens. But the reaction can produce formaldehyde and other potentially harmful chemicals that may damage people’s lungs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;New York subway train car with blue UV lights&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099682&quot; height=&quot;412&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/050621_TI_covid-air_inline-1_uv.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099682&quot;&gt;The Metropolitan Transit Authority in New York City recently launched a pilot program to sterilize subway cars, buses and other facilities with virus-killing UV light (pictured).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099682&quot;&gt;Marc A. Hermann / MTA New York City Transit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another product to shy away from is ionizers, which often come built into air purifiers along with HEPA filters. Companies have also been marketing “bipolar ionization” as a way to kill the virus in the air. Those electronic air cleaners work by creating ozone, gaseous hydrogen peroxide and other chemicals that may or may not kill the virus, but could also damage lungs, Zaatari says. She wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/open-letter-to-address-the-use-of-electronic-air/no-to-ionizers-plasma-uvpco-bc1570b2fb9b#id_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6Ijc3NDU3MzIxOGM2ZjZhMmZlNTBlMjlhY2JjNjg2NDMyODYzZmM5YzMiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QifQ.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.FgkIdrQQvfAnakpV1v4noM7hGRVUJPJiEEmefNTmxmsiK70y__VtAsZWlZi98XiLQhPo0wJr7moGEj84glxzRGP9x0_zzrzeoBlGUHQHOrUjqvXYSkiAlyz5zzuwbqP74E0-qluCTQYp4CXwPfhZsRS6S7es-2J8UJ_I61bmWX-RN3H5gXqXhj6Hd7cSihlrdL0t4lrL_RTJqlpaCs1kVQ0T8C0ufi9xEdm0LF0r4tD-BGQEsYPPGRTghqhVm0HQu0zWDAfRsYx3A4W-WKm4PHyYKkbBYgod7ZEiGN0Ss2__OTgN82mX5zyMvDF_QVzLZcarG7Xh9fB-aPwxs1LgHw&quot;&gt;an open letter&lt;/a&gt; urging schools and organizations that set building standards to not use the devices.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some companies say that their ionizers don’t produce ozone. That may well be, but ozone is what is doing the work to kill pathogens, Zaatari says. “So, when they show us a test with no ozone, we know the effectiveness is close to zero.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of those products has not been proven the way ventilation, filtration and UV-C irradiation have, she says. “At best they don’t work, and at worst they produce harmful by-products,” Zaatari says. “We don’t have a shortage of proven solutions. So why would we, in uncertain times, do uncertain things?”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;In an instant, the bomb obliterated everything.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tower it sat on and the copper wires strung around it: vaporized. The desert sand below: melted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the first test of an atomic bomb, in July 1945, all this debris fused together, leaving the ground of the New Mexico test site coated with a glassy substance now called trinitite. High temperatures and pressures helped forge an unusual structure within one piece of trinitite, in a grain of the material just 10 micrometers across — a bit longer than a red blood cell.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That grain contains &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2101350118&quot;&gt;a rare form of matter called a quasicrystal&lt;/a&gt;, born the moment the nuclear age began, scientists report May 17 in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Normal crystals are made of atoms locked in a lattice that repeats in a regular pattern. Quasicrystals have a structure that is orderly like a normal crystal but that doesn’t repeat. This means quasicrystals can have properties that are forbidden for normal crystals. First discovered in the lab in 1980s, quasicrystals also appear in nature &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/third-kind-quasicrystal-found-russian-meteorite&quot;&gt;in meteorites&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/8/16&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignleft size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;penrose tiling diagram with green and blue pattern&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3099707&quot; height=&quot;680&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/051721_ec_bomb-quasicrystal_inline_680.png&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3099707&quot;&gt;Penrose tilings (one shown) are an example of a structure that is ordered but does not repeat. Quasicrystals are a three-dimensional version of this idea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3099707&quot;&gt;Inductiveload/Wikimedia Commons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The newly discovered quasicrystal from the New Mexico test site is the oldest one known that was made by humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trinitite takes its moniker from the nuclear test, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-atom-matter-particle-nuclear-power-neutron&quot;&gt;named Trinity&lt;/a&gt;, in which the material was created in abundance (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/8/21&lt;/em&gt;). “You can still buy lots of it on eBay,” says geophysicist Terry Wallace, a coauthor of the study and emeritus director of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But, he notes, the trinitite the team studied was a rarer variety, called red trinitite. Most trinitite has a greenish tinge, but red trinitite contains copper, remnants of the wires that stretched from the ground to the bomb. Quasicrystals tend to be found in materials that have experienced a violent impact and usually involve metals. Red trinitite fit both criteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But first the team had to find some.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was asking around for months looking for red trinitite,” says theoretical physicist Paul Steinhardt of Princeton University. But Steinhardt, who is known for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quest-quasicrystals-physics-adventure-tale&quot;&gt;trekking to Siberia&lt;/a&gt; to seek out quasicrystals, wasn’t deterred (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/19/19&lt;/em&gt;). Eventually, mineralogist Luca Bindi of the University of Florence got some from an expert in trinitite, who began collaborating with the team. Then the painstaking work started, with Bindi “looking through every little microscopic speck” of the trinitite sample, says Steinhardt. Finally, Bindi extracted the tiny grain. By scattering X-rays through it, the researchers revealed that the material had a type of symmetry found only in quasicrystals. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The new quasicrystal, formed of silicon, copper, calcium and iron, is “brand new to science,” says mineralogist Chi Ma of Caltech, who was not involved with the study. “It’s a quite cool and exciting discovery,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future searches for quasicrystals could examine other materials that experienced a punishing blow, such as impact craters or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/phosphorus-earth-earliest-life-forged-lightning-chemistry&quot;&gt;fulgurites&lt;/a&gt;, fused structures formed when lightning strikes soil (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/16/21&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study shows that artifacts from the birth of the atomic age are still of scientific interest, says materials scientist Miriam Hiebert of the University of Maryland in College Park, who has analyzed materials from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-trace-uranium-cube-nazi-germany-nuclear-reactor-program&quot;&gt;other pivotal moments in nuclear history&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/1/19&lt;/em&gt;). “Historic objects and materials are not just curiosities in collectors’ cabinets but can be of real scientific value,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Smell is often considered to be a particularly evocative sense: if you haven’t yourself been transported back in time by a nostalgic scent then you’ll almost certainly be familiar with the phenomenon via reference to the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/01/23/do-smells-really-trigger-particularly-evocative-memories/&quot;&gt;Proustian rush.&lt;/a&gt; Scent is also increasingly being used in marketing, with some &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022243718820585&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that smell can influence consumers’ judgements and decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcpy.1231&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal for Consumer Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, takes a closer look at how smell interacts with other senses to influence our perceptions. The team, led by the University of South Florida’s Dipayan Biswas, finds that looking at food before smelling it may enhance our enjoyment of what we eat. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42093&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 198 students were split into four conditions. In all conditions, five pieces of a red strawberry-flavoured fruit snack were placed in front of participants inside an opaque envelope. In the first condition, participants smelled the snack first before looking inside the envelope; in the second, participants looked at the snack before smelling it; and in the final two conditions, participants were instructed to either only smell or only look at the snack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All participants then rated the expected taste of the snack, as well as describing its smell and colour. They were then allowed to eat the fruit snack, and rated their perception of the actual taste and how much they liked it. Finally, they stated whether or not they would recommend it to a friend and were asked whether they either wanted an entry into a prize draw for a gift card or a pouch of the snack they had just sampled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Expected taste was more favourable in the condition where participants saw the food before they smelled it; those in this condition also evaluated the snack more favourably &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; tasting. These participants were also more likely to recommend the snack to a friend, and more likely to accept the full sized pouch at the end of a survey than to enter the prize draw. Together, this suggests that seeing the food before smelling it had a favourable impact on enjoyment. A second study, which replicated the first but with a fizzy drink, and a third which did the same with a cookie, produced similar results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the final study, participants either received lemonade that was coloured purple, so that its look was incongruent with its lemony smell, or that retained its clear “natural” colour. When the scent was consistent with the look of the beverage, those who saw the drink before they smelled it again reported that it tasted better than those who smelled it before they saw it. However, when the visual cue was incongruent with the smell, taste was rated in a similar way in both conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team suggests when people see and then smell a food or drink, it’s easier to process the smell, leading to increased taste perception. But when the visual cues are incongruent with the smell, seeing first and then smelling can actually make it harder to process the smell, as the smell seems inconsistent with the colour. This could be a sign that food and drink manufacturers should stay away from artificial colouring that doesn’t match expected taste or smell.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results suggest that having a good look at your food before you smell it could lead to increased enjoyment. Unless you’re willing to put a peg on your nose while you cook, however, this might be difficult to enact when you’re making your own dinner. But for premade food purchased in supermarkets, bakeries or elsewhere, clever packaging could enhance enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcpy.1231&quot;&gt;Effects of Sequential Sensory Cues on Food Taste Perception: Cross‐Modal Interplay Between Visual and Olfactory Stimuli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/Module-1-screenshot-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few institutions provide training on strategies for increasing diversity among clinical trial participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many research teams struggle to recruit racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials, despite increasing awareness of the need for diversity. Unfortunately, few institutions provide training for research teams on strategies for increasing diversity among clinical trial participants. To address this need, we developed a massive open online course, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/recruitment-minorities-clinical-trials&quot;&gt;Faster Together&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the course is to help individuals involved in the clinical research enterprise (including investigators, recruiters, and clinical research coordinators), gain the knowledge and skills needed to successfully recruit and retain racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01240-x&quot;&gt;our manuscript&lt;/a&gt;, we describe the design, implementation, and initial evaluation results based on the ten-month period since the course was released. Briefly, the course was developed through a collaborative process involving a team of content experts, knowledge management information scientists, and videographers. Community feedback was incorporated throughout the course development process through consultation with the Recruitment Innovation Center Community Advisory Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/recruitment-minorities-clinical-trials&quot;&gt;course&lt;/a&gt; consists of eight modules, which can each be completed within an hour. The individual modules are divided into short (~10 minute) segments to try to make it easier for learners to complete the training when they have available time. The modules focus on topics including understanding the need for diversity in clinical research, barriers and facilitators to participation, community engagement strategies, pre-screening, consent, and retention. The course content is freely available, and learners can work at their own pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, feedback from course participants has been positive, and participants have indicated that the course increased their knowledge of the topic. It remains to be seen whether participation in the course will translate to changes in minority enrollment in clinical trials. However, the majority of learners in our study reported that they intended to alter their recruitment practices as a result of their course participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training on its own will not lead to changes, unless supplemented by actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that initiatives such as our course will ultimately result in more equitable representation of minorities in clinical trials. Achieving diversity in research participation is necessary to be able to understand whether the findings of a given study will be relevant for different populations. We recognize that training on its own will not lead to changes, unless supplemented by actions. Changes may be needed at the individual, team, and institutional levels. Responding to the call for increased diversity in clinical trial participation is one of many critical steps we can take to help reduce health disparities and promote health equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A neural implant has allowed a paralysed individual to type by imagining writing letters&lt;/strong&gt;. The implant of 200 electrodes in the premotor cortex picks up on the person’s intentions to perform the movements associated with writing a given letter, translating these into a character on a screen. The individual was able to type 90 characters per minute with minimal errors, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/05/neural-implant-lets-paralyzed-person-type-by-imagining-writing/&quot;&gt;reports John Timmer&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42079&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robin Dunbar famously estimated that humans are limited to having around 150 friends, due to cognitive restrictions imposed by the size of our brains.&lt;/strong&gt; Now a new study challenges the accuracy of Dunbar’s number, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/11/science/dunbars-number-debunked.html&quot;&gt;as Jenny Gross reports&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; (though Dunbar in turn disputes the findings).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor sleep can make us less able to focus on a task at hand and ignore distractions&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s according to a study comparing the performance on an attention test of 23 people with insomnia and 23 good sleepers. The results might not sound very surprising, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/poor-sleep-linked-to-inability-to-focus-new-study-160399&quot;&gt;as researchers David James Robertson and Christopher B Miller point out&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, it hammers home how important sleep is for tasks like driving, where distractions can be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An analysis of bacteria in the teeth of Neanderthals and ancient &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; has found that both groups ate lots of starchy foods.&lt;/strong&gt; This in turn suggests that their common ancestor was already eating these kinds of foods more than 600,000 years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/05/neanderthals-carb-loaded-helping-grow-their-big-brains&quot;&gt;reports Ann Gibbons&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. This was a time when hominin brains became a lot bigger, so the researchers think that the starch gave ancient humans the energy needed to fuel this growth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral panics about technology are common — but they rarely consider how those technologies evolve.&lt;/strong&gt; After all, movies and video games from the 1970s are very different from their modern day counterparts. So have the supposed links between these technologies and mental health outcomes changed over time? Broadly, no, &lt;a href=&quot;https://unherd.com/thepost/the-digital-world-wont-harm-you/&quot;&gt;reports Tom Chivers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Unherd.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have explored how individual neurons across different parts of the brain behave when someone (well, a monkey) undergoes anaesthesia&lt;/strong&gt;. At &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/this-is-your-brain-under-anesthesia/&quot;&gt;Max G Levy looks at the results of the studies&lt;/a&gt;, and ponders their implications for understanding consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we control our experience of disgust?&lt;/strong&gt; At &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/disgust-can-be-morally-valuable/&quot;&gt;Charlie Kurth explores&lt;/a&gt; what the research says about combatting disgust in non-moral scenarios (think a medical student disgusted by the sight of blood) — and how this might extend to moral situations (when someone is disgusted by members of a certain social group, for instance).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;To infer spike rates from calcium imaging data for a time point &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;, knowledge about the calcium signal both before and after time &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; is required. Our algorithm &lt;em&gt;Cascade&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;) uses by default a window that is symmetric in time and feeds this window into a small deep network to use the data points in the window for spike inference (schematic below taken from Fig. 2A of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt;; CC-BY-NC 4.0):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6807&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6807&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;figure-2a_mod&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-2a_mod.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-2a_mod.png?w=215&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-2a_mod.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;956,1331&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/figure-2a_mod/&quot; height=&quot;483&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-2a_mod.png?w=735&quot; width=&quot;347&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, if one wants to perform spike inference not as a post-processing step but rather during the experiment (“online spike inference”), it would be ideal to perform spike inference with a delay as short as possible. This would allow for example to use the result of spike inference for a closed-loop interaction with the animal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ringachlab.net/&quot;&gt;Dario Ringach&lt;/a&gt; recently came up with this interesting problem. With the Cascade algorithm already set up, I was curious to check very specifically: How many time points (i.e., imaging frames) are required after time point &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; to perform reliable spike inference?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using GCaMP/mouse datasets from the large ground truth database (teh database is again described in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt;), I addressed this question directly by training separate models. For each mode, the time window was shifted such that a variable number of data points (between minimally 1 and maximally 32) were used for spike inference. Everything was evaluated at a typical frame rate of 30 Hz, and also at different noise levels of the recordings (color-coded below); a noise level of “2” is pretty decent, while a noise level of “8” is quite noisy – explained with examples (Fig. S3) and equations (Methods) again in the preprint.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6810&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6810&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;figure-1-2&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;869,726&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/figure-1-2/&quot; height=&quot;264&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-2.png?w=869&quot; width=&quot;317&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results are quite clear: For low noise levels (black curve, SEM across datasets as corridor), spike inference seems to reach a saturating performance (correlation with ground truth spike rates) around a value of almost 8 frames. This would result in a delay of almost 8*33 ms ≈ 260 ms after a spiking event (dashed line).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But let’s have a closer look. The above curve was averaged across 8 datasets, mixing different indicators (GCaMP6f and GCaMP6s) and induction methods (transgenic mouse lines and AAV-based induction). Below, I looked into the curve for each single dataset (for the noise level of 2).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is immediately clear that for some datasets fewer frames after &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; are sufficient for almost optimal spike inference, for others not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6812&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6812&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;figure-1-3&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;2022,665&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/figure-1-3/&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/figure-1-3.png?w=1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the best datasets, optimal performance is already reached with 4 frames (left panel; delay of ca. 120 ms). These are datasets #10 and #11, which use the fast indicator GCaMP6f, which in addition is here transgenically expressed. The corresponding spike-triggered linear kernels (right side; copied from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2&quot;&gt;Fig. S1 of the preprint&lt;/a&gt;) are indeed faster than for other datasets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two datasets with GCaMP6s (datasets #15 and #16) stand out as non-ideal, requiring almost 16 frames after &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; before optimal performance is reached. Probably, expression levels in these experiment using AAV-based approaches were very high, resulting in &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2018.09.005&quot;&gt;calcium buffering&lt;/a&gt; and therefore slower transients. The corresponding spike-triggered linear kernels are indeed much slower than for the other GCaMP6s- or GCaMP6f-based datasets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The script used to perform the above evaluations can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade/blob/master/etc/Evaluate_delay_online_spike_inference.py&quot;&gt;Cascade’s Github repository&lt;/a&gt;. Since each data point requires retraining the model from scratch, it cannot be run on a CPU in reasonable time. On a RTX 2080 Ti, the script took 2-3 days to complete.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; Only few frames (down to 4 frames) after time&lt;em&gt; t&lt;/em&gt; are sufficient to perform almost ideal spike inference. This is probably a consequence of the fact that the sharp step increase is more informative than the slow decay of a spike-triggered event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To optimize the experiment for online spike-inference, it is helpful to use a fast indicator (e.g., GCaMP6f). It also seems that transgenic expression might be an advantage, since indicator expression and calcium buffering is typically lower for transgenic expression than for viral induction, preventing a slow-down of the indicator by overexpression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce our collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://paperswithcode.com/&quot;&gt;Papers With Code&lt;/a&gt; to support links to datasets on &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning articles on arXiv now have a Code &amp;amp; Data tab to link to datasets that are used or introduced in a paper. Readers can activate Links to Code &amp;amp; Data from the paper abstract page to see links to official code, community implementations of the code, and the datasets used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_979&quot; style=&quot;width: 400px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot of links to datasets from arXiv abstract pages&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-979 size-full&quot; height=&quot;539&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/PwC-Data-Screen-Shot-2021-05-10-at-4.00.24-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;From the “Code &amp;amp; Data” tab on the arXiv article abstract page, readers can find links to datasets used in the paper.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors can add datasets to their arXiv papers by going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/login&quot;&gt;arxiv.org/user&lt;/a&gt; and clicking on the “Link to code &amp;amp; data” Papers with Code icon (see below). From there they will be directed to Papers with Code where they can add their datasets. Once added, these will show on the arXiv article’s abstract page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes tracking dataset usage across the community and quickly finding other papers using the same dataset easier. From Papers with Code, readers can discover other papers using the same dataset, track usage over time, compare models, and find similar datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All data on Papers with Code is freely available and is licensed under CC-BY-SA (same as Wikipedia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An arXivLabs Collaboration&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv’s mission is to provide an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant, emerging science and establish their contribution to advancing research. Datasets are a critical component of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second stage of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/28/arxivlabs-a-space-for-community-innovation/&quot;&gt;arXivLabs collaboration&lt;/a&gt; with Papers with Code, following &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/08/new-arxivlabs-feature-provides-instant-access-to-code/&quot;&gt;the introduction of code on arXiv&lt;/a&gt; last October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Members of our community want to contribute tools that enhance the arXiv experience, and we value that kind of community engagement,” said Eleonora Presani, arXiv Executive Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_981&quot; style=&quot;width: 926px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screen shot of arXiv user page showing icon to link to datasets on Papers with Code&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-981 size-full&quot; height=&quot;244&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-10-at-4.10.58-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;926&quot; /&gt;From the arXiv user account page, authors can click on the Papers with Code icon to link their work to relevant code and data.&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After an incredibly stressful day of work, which are you more likely to do: walk several miles home, or get on a bus straight to your door? While the first option certainly comes with increased health benefits — including, potentially, decreased stress — many of us would choose the second anyway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-72489-001&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied&lt;/em&gt;, seeks to understand why, even when we know how positive exercise can be, we often fail to be active after work. It could come down to how high-pressure your job is, according to Sascha Abdel Hadi from Justus-Liebig-University Giessen and team — and how much control you have over your work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42073&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 100 participants took part in a workplace simulation. Adopting the role of a call centre worker, participants answered emails from customers, solved maths problems related to product pricing and promotions, and answered a live customer call.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the low demand condition, emails and phone calls were from friendly customers, while in the high demand condition, customers were disgruntled; maths problems also ranged in difficulty based on condition. High demand participants were also explicitly instructed to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/cost-smile&quot;&gt;serve with a smile&lt;/a&gt;”, while the low demand condition only required “acting authentically”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following these tasks, participants were invited to ride (up to a maximum of fifteen minutes) on a static bike in the break room, for as long as they wanted, after which they could read magazines in a seated position. As expected, those in the high demand condition spent significantly less time on the bike than those in the low demand condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second study, conducted with 144 participants, sought to expand on these findings — only this time, there was an additional focus on the control people had over the choices they made during the job. In addition to the high and low demand conditions  from the first study, participants were assigned to a high or low control condition. Participants in the high control condition could select which emails they responded to and in which order, which arithmetic problems they wanted to solve, and which customer requests they picked up via call. Low control participants could do none of these things.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again, participants with a more demanding job spent less time on the bike. And while there was no direct relationship between levels of control and time spent on the bike, there was an indirect effect of job control on cycling time through its impact on participant’s feelings of self-determination — their beliefs that they are autonomous and able to freely make choices. People in the low control condition rated their self-determination as lower, which in turn led to reduced time cycling. This suggests that high levels of control can improve self-determination — and, indirectly, increase self-motivated behaviour, even outside of the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This last point is key. What we do at work (or perhaps more accurately, what is done to or imposed on us) doesn’t just affect the hours we spend in the office, in the factory, or on the shop floor. Rather, these things seep into our personal lives, making us more or less likely to use leisure time the way we might want. The team suggests that other mechanisms could also play a role in the link between job demands and exercise: for instance, if people are unable to “switch off” from work demands, this may hamper motivation to engage in activities like working out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Either way, it is clear that jobs with high levels of demand can impact not only our overall wellbeing but our motivation outside of work. The team suggests that employers should place greater importance on self-determination and participation; and, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/09/involvement-in-workplace-democracy-can-alter-your-view-of-authority/&quot;&gt;other research suggests&lt;/a&gt;, this could also change how democratic, just and participatory workplaces are.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-72489-001&quot;&gt;Experimental evidence for the effects of job demands and job control on physical activity after work.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 A group of anesthesiology researchers in China have lost their 2020 paper on nerve blocks during lung surgery after finding that the work contained “too many” errors to stand. But after hearing from the top editor of the journal, it’s pretty clear “too many errors” was a euphemism for even worse problems.

 &lt;p&gt;Author: &lt;strong&gt;Roheena Anand&lt;/strong&gt;, Director, Global Publishing Development, PLOS&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago we &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; five new journals and their role in our plans to spread our roots deeper and absorb researchers and local practices more fully into our business. However, this is only one part of our work in this area. In the transition to an Open future we need to keep asking ourselves “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/theme-of-2019-international-open-access-week-to-be-open-for-whom-&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open for Whom?&lt;/a&gt;” Openness in itself, while valuable, does not tackle inequality in the scholarly communications ecosystem, or increase inclusion.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we need to be intentional in addressing power imbalances and the legacy of devaluing knowledge from particular groups or regions, e.g. from communities often marginalized in North American/Western European publications, including researchers from Low-to-Middle-Income countries. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this year we will be expanding our presence into different continents, embedding ourselves into local communities to work alongside them, listening and learning, so that we can understand and reflect their needs and values.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today&lt;/strong&gt;, as our first major step, we’re sharing the wonderful news that we are formally partnering with the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tcc-africa.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Training Centre in Communication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, based in the University of Nairobi, Kenya, commonly known as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tcc-africa.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TCC Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. TCC Africa is a nonprofit trust that has been doing valuable work across the continent since 2006. They’re committed to improving African researchers’ visibility (and therefore impact) through training in scholarly communication. Like us, they are heavily invested in an Open future and work with stakeholders across the scholarly communication ecosystem to promote and increase uptake of open access and open science more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Working with TCC Africa will help us to ensure that the interests and values of African research communities are represented in PLOS publications, policies, and services and to ensure that Open Science practices work for local stakeholders. We believe that all Open Science and Open Research activities should be informed and co-created by local communities at a global scale, helping us all to rebuild the system better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve started to build our strategic plan to achieve our joint goals: it’s the first step on our path to a more inclusive Open Science future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please follow PLOS and TCC Africa on social media, and/or follow our blogs, to keep up to date on the progress of this partnership!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event sensors implement circuits that capture partial functionality of
biological sensors, such as the retina and cochlea. As with their
biological counterparts, event sensors are drivers of their own
output. That is, they produce dynamically sampled binary events to
dynamically changing stimuli. Algorithms and networks that process
this form of output representation are still in their infancy, but
they show strong promise. This article illustrates the unique form of
the data produced by the sensors and demonstrates how the properties
of these sensor outputs make them useful for power-efficient,
low-latency systems working in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/05/12/want-to-know-whether-a-movie-or-book-will-be-a-hit-look-at-how-emotional-the-reviews-are/"/>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You want to choose a new vacuum cleaner, or book, or hotel, or kids’ toy, or movie to watch — so what do you do? No doubt, you go online and check the star ratings for various options on sites such as Amazon or TripAdvisor, and so benefit from the wisdom of crowds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, there are problems with this star-based system, as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01098-5&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt; makes clear. Firstly, most ratings are positive — so how do you choose between two, or potentially many more, products with high ratings, or even the same top rating? Secondly, star ratings aren’t a great predictor of the success (and so actual general appeal and approval) of a movie, book, and so on, note Matthew D. Rocklage at the University of Massachusetts and his colleagues. The team presents an alternative method for picking the best product and also predicting success, which focuses on the emotional responses of the reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42060&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In all four studies reported in the paper, the team used a text analysis tool called the Evaluative Lexicon. This provided measures of the average emotionality and valence (positivity) of a review. Emotionality relates to how much an attitude is rooted in emotion, rather than how positive or negative it is (so reviews that included lots of terms like “awe-inspiring” or “enchanting” got higher emotionality scores than reviews with terms like “impeccable”.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, the team looked at the earliest 30 reviews for all movies included on the website metacritic.com from 2005 to 2018. For each movie, they gathered star ratings (from 0 to 10), valence scores and measures of text emotionality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, 81% of these movies got above average star-ratings. This highlights “the challenge of discerning success and how people will behave in this sea of positive ratings”, which the team calls the “positivity problem”. They also found that star ratings weren’t a good predictor of box office revenue, and text valence wasn’t a helpful predictor, either. Higher emotionality was a positive predictor of future box office takings, however. (This result held when they controlled for a variety of factors, including the genre of the movie, the year it was released, its budget, and so on.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, Rocklage and colleagues used the same approach to try to predict the sales of all books listed on Amazon.com from 1995 to 2015. This time, for some genres, star ratings did predict sales, while for others they didn’t. However, greater emotionality emerged as a predictor of sales across 93 different genres. It was, then, consistently useful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers then turned to 187,206 real-time tweets posted in response to TV ads for 84 different businesses played during the 2016 and 2017 US Super Bowls. The team found that the greater the emotionality of the tweets about an advert, the more Facebook followers the company gathered over the next two weeks. The equivalent of star ratings for these ads had been gathered by the newspaper USA Today, and these ratings were not predictive of followers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the team considered Chicago restaurant reviews on yelp.com and 1.3 million table reservations made on a popular booking website. In contrast to earlier results, high star ratings did predict more table reservations. However, higher emotionality still emerged as a unique predictor of numbers of bookings. As the team writes, “restaurants that elicited more emotion were associated with more table reservations”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, then, movies, books and restaurants that appeared to evoke more emotion in consumers ended up being more successful. Why might that be the case? Emotions flag memories as being important, and are relatively readily recalled, and attitudes based on emotion &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/19/opinions-based-on-feelings-are-surprisingly-stable/&quot;&gt;tend to be more stable&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly this could influence a person’s own behaviour. “Additional work could explore whether attitudes based more on emotion also affect success by increasing individuals’ propensity to spread information via word of mouth,” the team notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the new work does call into question the validity and helpfulness of star ratings. This in itself is not new, but of course the researchers also describe what seems to be a more useful system, which in theory could be broadly adopted. “One possibility is that organizations could consider aggregating reviewers’ language and providing an ‘emotional star rating’ to provide more meaningful assessments to individuals,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2021/05/12/10-years-of-brainhack-an-open-inclusive-culture-for-neuro-tool-developers-at-all-levels/"/>
		<id>https://malinsandstrom.blog/?p=2064</id>
		<updated>2021-05-12T09:53:12+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Brainhacks and similar formats are increasingly recognized as a new way of providing academic training and conducting research that extends traditional settings. There is a new paper out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(21)00231-2&quot;&gt;in Neuron&lt;/a&gt;, by 200+ authors, describing the format and what makes it valuable to the community. This post aims to highlight some of the core themes of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brainhacks have been held since 2012, organized by local communities, sometimes in sync with other hackathons taking place elsewhere. In 2016 the format developed into the Brainhack Global – a synchronous swarm of hybrid meetings arranged by local communities with local and virtual participants. In 2020, during the pandemic, the BG went fully virtual.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QyhV2wtej9eq5z6i1cL-fT0EGPWLrwHdjZgIbB08cnLkFLkQhWFXRyCzbzKWM52ah7uOSEJrmnbD2CSdk-Y1sDM8LsJMaaAeN_PUF_c57duNgo-8PomZvXEhqgtPsni1GdRN7VXq&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Figure 1D from &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.04.001&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.04.001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A similar growth of hackathons has occurred in communities adjacent to Brainhack. INCF started funding hackathons early because our community asked for it; and when we saw the value and inspiration hackathons brought to the community, it became a regular line item in the INCF budget. Since funding our first hackathon in 2012, we have funded or partially funded at least one hackathon each year (see our entry in &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainhack.org/brainhack_jupyter_book/acknowledgments.html&quot;&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Brainhack format is inspired by the hackathon model and centers on ad-hoc, informal collaborations for building, updating and extending community software tools developed by the participants’ peers, with the goal to have functioning software by the end of the event. Unlike many hackathons, Brainhacks welcome participants from all disciplines and with any level of experience—from those who have never written a line of code to software developers and expert neuroscientists, and also feature informal dissemination of ongoing research through unconferences. Also unlike some traditional hackathons, Brainhacks do not have competitions. Brainhacks value education; recent major Brainhack events even have a TrainTrack, a set of entirely education-focused sessions that run in parallel with regular hacking on projects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;The five defining Brainhack features: &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;1) a project-oriented approach that fosters active participation and community-driven problem-solving&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2) learning by doing, which enables participants to gain more intensive training, particularly in computational methods&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3) training in open science and collaborative coding, which helps participants become more effective collaborators&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;4) focus on reproducibility, which leads to more robust scientific research; and &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;5) accelerated building and bridging of communities, which encourages inclusivity and seamless collaboration between researchers at different career stages&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brainhacks have increased insight in the value of tool usability and reusability and the need for long-term maintenance; shifting community culture from individuals creating tools for their own needs to a community actively contributing to an existing resource. They also help to disseminate good practices for writing code and documentation, ensuring code readability, using version control and licensing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brainhacks promote awareness of reproducible practices that integrate easily into research workflows, and show the value of data sharing and open data. They introduce participants to data standards, such as BIDS, allowing them to experience the benefits of a unified data organization and provides them with the skillset to use these formats in their own research. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brainhacks create a scientific culture around open and standardized data, metadata, and methods, as well as detailed documentation and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Brainhack community are currently also working to collate Brainhack-related insights and expertise into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainhack.org/brainhack_jupyter_book/&quot;&gt;Jupyter Book &lt;/a&gt; that will serve as a centralized set of resources for the community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LINKS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What does being a good leader mean to you? Having tonnes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/14/with-leader-charisma-its-possible-to-have-too-much-of-a-good-thing/&quot;&gt;charisma&lt;/a&gt;? Being &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/13/very-intelligent-people-make-less-effective-leaders-according-to-their-peers-and-subordinates/&quot;&gt;intelligent&lt;/a&gt;? Encouraging fairness and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/09/involvement-in-workplace-democracy-can-alter-your-view-of-authority/&quot;&gt;participation in the workplace&lt;/a&gt;? Whatever combination of qualities you value, it’s likely that your vision of good leadership is different from your colleague’s or your manager’s, who themselves will have a highly personal vision of who they want to be at work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/peps.12447&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; from Remy E. Jennings at the University of Florida and colleagues, published in &lt;em&gt;Personnel Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, looks closely at this individualised idea of leadership — our “best possible leader self”. If we focus and reflect on this best possible self every morning, they find, it could help us behave more like a leader in the here and now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42052&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were 54 students (mainly White men) enrolled on a weekend MBA course in the United States, chosen because they were likely to aspire to leadership. All participants were in the intervention condition for five days and the control condition for five days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the intervention condition, participants were asked to write expressively every morning in response to the prompt “think about your best possible self in a leadership role sometime in the future. Imagine everything has gone as well as it possibly could for you. Think of this as the realisation of the best possible leader you could ever hope to be”. During this period, participants were also asked to reflect on positive traits, useful skills and achievements they felt they had and that could help them become this best possible leader.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the control condition participants wrote instead about three neutral objects, describing their car, objects in their office, or landmarks they saw on their way to work. Positive and negative affect was measured in both conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day was the same in both conditions. In the afternoon, a follow-up survey looked at “helping” behaviours, with participants asked whether they had mentored or helped someone at work or given encouragement or appreciation to colleagues, and “visioning” behaviours: whether participants had spoken about future opportunities or strategic goals during their day. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the evening, participants responded to two measures. One, looking at leader identity, required participants to indicate how much they agreed with statements such as “today, I displayed the characteristics of a leader”; the other invited them to describe their day in their own words and was later analysed for feelings of high expertise and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results showed that reflecting on the best possible leader self increased participants’ positive affect, which in turn was associated with more helping behaviours and with vision-related behaviours during the work day. Those engaging in both helping and vision-related behaviours also felt more like they had behaved like a leader that day, and showed more “clout” — the feelings of high expertise and confidence as measured in the evening survey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that a period of envisioning and reflecting on the best possible leader self could make people more helpful and more confident in their leadership abilities. There are, however, limitations. Firstly, the small sample size was overwhelmingly made up of White men: would such an intervention have the same impact for other groups? Similarly, it’s important not to take the results as a straightforward ticket to success in the workplace. Self-reflection may be beneficial for many, but there may also be systemic factors working against promotion or increased clout for women, people of colour, or others who can be marginalised at work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It would also be interesting to explore the actual content of participants’ best possible leader selves. Results from the study suggest that self-reflection of any kind can increase prosocial helping behaviours — but what if somebody’s best possible leader self is authoritarian and harsh with employees, or focused merely on power rather than collectivity or helpfulness? Looking at the range of “leader selves” and how they interact with workplace behaviours could give further insight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/peps.12447&quot;&gt;Reflecting on one’s best possible self as a leader: Implications for professional employees at work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/05/10/in-english-round-and-spiky-objects-tend-to-have-round-and-spiky-sounds/"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of us are familiar with the “bouba/kiki”, or “maluma/takete” effect — that we tend to pair round, blobby shapes with the words “bouba” or “maluma” and spiky shapes with “kiki” or “takete”. These findings hold for speakers of many different languages and ages, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/20/we-find-some-word-sounds-more-emotionally-arousing-than-others/&quot;&gt;various explanations for the effect have been proposed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But these studies have almost exclusively used made-up words (like these four), note the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-021-01883-3&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Psychonomic Bulletin &amp;amp; Review&lt;/em&gt;, who have found that the effect is also at play in the English language. That is, the components of made-up words that we commonly pair with a round shape tend also to be found in nouns that refer to actual round objects, and the same for spiky sounds and objects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42045&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;David M Sidhu, now at University College, London, and colleagues recruited 171 student participants in Canada. Each person was presented with 100 sets of six concrete nouns, and for each set, had to choose the two nouns that they felt referred to the “most round” and “most spiky” objects — so, for example, they had to pick the most-round and most-spiky objects from “unicycle”, “moon”, “balcony”, “pyramid”, “jet” and “driller”. From these results, the researchers generated a spiky/round rating for each word. (The top five “roundest” in order were : softball, ball, olive, pea and globe, while spike, fork, porcupine and scalpel led the “spikiest” object list.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team then looked at the phonemes, or distinct “units” of sound, which made up these nouns. They compared these results with those from earlier studies that have investigated which phonemes in made-up words are generally associated with roundness or spikiness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Almost all of the phonemes previously associated with roundness were indeed present in the real words that participants identified as referring to round objects, and the same for spikiness. So the sounds &lt;em&gt;u&lt;/em&gt; as in “up”, &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;oo&lt;/em&gt; as in boot and &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; were more common in nouns that referred to round objects, while the sounds &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; as in “ship” were more common in nouns that referred to spiky objects. “Our main finding was that many of the associations between phonemes and shapes found in laboratory tasks are attested in the pairing between sound and meaning in English,” the team writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There were a few unexpected findings. For example, in this study, in contrast to some earlier ones involving made-up words, &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sh&lt;/em&gt; were more common in words for spiky objects. However, this result does fit with work linking certain phonemes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/08/28/heres-why-spiky-shapes-seem-angry-and-round-sounds-are-calming/&quot;&gt;greater or lesser emotional arousa&lt;/a&gt;l. We tend to perceive words with hissing sounds as being higher in emotional arousal — which is also linked to spikiness. The researchers also note that these phonemes, along with other consonants common in words for spiky objects, require the involvement of the tongue, whereas &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;, etc are made just with the lips.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This work contributes to the argument that (in addition to cases of onomatopoeia) there is at least some relationship between the sound of words in English and what they refer to. This isn’t a powerful relationship; as the researchers themselves stress: “Many other factors play larger roles in the form of language.” Still, the work does reveal some consistent round/spiky patterns in real English words, which seems to be a first in almost 100 years of research into this effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-021-01883-3&quot;&gt;Sound symbolism shapes the English language: The maluma/takete effect in English nouns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Grumpy” dogs may be better learners than their more agreeable counterparts&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/06/science/dogs-intelligence-learning.html&quot;&gt;reports James Gorman&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers found that grumpier canines were better at learning how to reach an object placed behind a fence by observing a stranger. But other scientists suggest that something more specific than “grumpiness” is responsible for the animals’ superior performance, such as increased aggression, reduced inhibition, or hyperactivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42034&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adults are more compassionate when children are around&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s according to a series of studies whose results include the finding that people are more likely to donate to charity when more kids are nearby, and even that adults are more prosocial after merely thinking about children. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/adults-are-more-generous-in-the-presence-of-children-new-research-160311&quot;&gt;Lukas Wolf and colleagues explain the work&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychologists are working on various strategies to help people deal with the “infodemic” of fake news and social media manipulation. &lt;/strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;Undark,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://undark.org/2021/05/03/psychology-misinformation-public-square/&quot;&gt;Teresa Carr explores some of these attempts&lt;/a&gt;, ranging from online games to lessons on how to behave like fact-checkers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The country’s recent obsession with the Union flag could end up damaging social cohesion&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/british-flag-politics&quot;&gt;warns Amit Katwala&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;. While flags can act as a symbol of unity, research has found that they can also make outsiders feel less welcome. Other work has shown that, in some cases, the presence of a flag can increase feelings of nationalism and prejudice towards immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the not-too-distant future, our lives may return to something resembling the pre-2020 days&lt;/strong&gt;. But after more than a year of living under lockdowns and social distancing rules, many of us are likely to find it hard to resume “normal” life. At &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cave-syndrome-keeps-the-vaccinated-in-social-isolation1/&quot;&gt;Melba Newsome examines&lt;/a&gt; what some people are calling “cave syndrome”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two hundred years ago, Franz Joseph Gall popularised phrenology, the idea that patterns of bumps on our skulls predict our character. &lt;/strong&gt;In a &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt; video hosted at &lt;em&gt;Aeon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/videos/the-dangerous-nonsense-of-phrenology-shows-how-pseudoscience-takes-hold&quot;&gt;Claudia Hammond explores&lt;/a&gt; the history of an idea that was clearly pseudoscience, but which nevertheless contributed in some ways to modern psychology and neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patients can experience positive effects from taking a placebo, even when they know they’re being given an inert pill. &lt;/strong&gt;That’s the case for conditions ranging from depression and anxiety to arthritis and irritable-bowel syndrome&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;So how exactly do these “open-label” placebos work? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/unexplainable/22405880/placebo-mystery-open-label-pain-medicine&quot;&gt;Brian Resnick takes a look&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jealousy is a fairly common human emotion — and for a long time, it was presumed it truly was only human. Some &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781444323542.ch2&quot;&gt;have argued&lt;/a&gt; that jealousy, with its focus on social threat, requires a concept of “self” and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/01/27/a-promising-study-suggests-teachers-can-train-8-year-olds-in-theory-of-mind/&quot;&gt;theory of mind&lt;/a&gt; — being jealous of someone flirting with your partner, for example, requires a level of threat (real or imagined) to your relationship. This element of jealousy has been used to argue that animals, without such a sense of self, are therefore unable to experience it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620979149&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, suggests this might not be the case. Amalia P. M. Bastos and team from the University of Auckland find evidence that dogs may, in fact, be able to mentally represent the threatening social interactions that give rise to jealousy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42024&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some previous research has already suggested that dogs get jealous — one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27251-1&quot;&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found that dogs would move in between or push owners away from interactions with fake dogs. But that research didn’t provide conclusive evidence that the dogs were actually experiencing jealousy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the team recruited 18 dogs and their owners: all dogs had been in the household for at least six months, were non-aggressive and showed no signs of discomfort within the experimental setting, removing the possibility that they would move towards a fake dog out of aggression or fear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The owner sat behind a large barrier, wearing a blindfold and noise-cancelling headphones. The dogs were placed around five metres away, tied to a door frame attached to a force gauge in order to measure how hard they pulled on their leash.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the fake dog condition, a realistic-looking fake dog was placed next to the owner behind the barrier. The barrier was then moved across the room for five seconds in order to reveal the fake dog to the real dog. When the barrier was moved back, blocking the view of the fake dog, the owner was instructed to pet and talk to it as if it were real.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the cylinder condition, on the other hand, owners were shown petting and talking to a fleece cylinder behind the barrier. The realistic looking fake dog was still in the room, however, placed behind a separate, smaller barrier and revealed to the real dog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dogs in the fake dog condition pulled significantly harder on their leashes than those in the fleece cylinder condition, suggesting that the dogs were attempting to break up the interaction between their owner and a perceived rival. The fact that the fake dog was present during the cylinder trials is important, showing that the mere &lt;em&gt;presence&lt;/em&gt; of a rival wasn’t enough to invoke jealous behaviours: it was the actual interaction with the dog’s owner that led to increased jealous behaviour. When the dogs were later allowed to reach the fake dog, the team also found that the dogs engaged in genital and face sniffing  —  suggesting that they believed the fake dogs were real throughout the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the dogs seemed to show “signatures” of jealous behaviour similar to those in humans: they reacted to a social partner engaging with a social rival (the fake dog) but not another object (the fleece cylinder), and didn’t react when the rival was in the room but not engaging with their owner. And most strikingly, they reacted strongly even though they couldn’t directly see the interaction between the owner and rival. Together, this suggests that dogs do indeed experience some form of jealousy, and can even mentally represent the social interactions that give rise to jealous feelings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This insight is important for several reasons, not only confirming previous research on jealousy in dogs but suggesting that dogs may have more complex cognitive abilities than we might assume. This may indicate the ability to conjure other mental representations in different situations  —  and a much richer inner life than we currently understand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620979149&quot;&gt;Dogs Mentally Represent Jealousy-Inducing Social Interactions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Maria Psarrou will talk about a paper &quot;Fast Odour Dynamics Are Encoded in the Olfactory System and Guide Behaviour&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odours are transported in turbulent plumes, which result in rapid concentration
fluctuations that contain rich information about the olfactory scenery, such as
the composition and location of an odour source. However, it is unclear whether
the mammalian olfactory system can use the underlying temporal structure to
extract information about the environment. Here we show that ten-millisecond
odour pulse patterns produce distinct responses in olfactory receptor neurons.
In operant conditioning experiments, mice discriminated temporal correlations
of rapidly fluctuating odours at frequencies of up to 40 Hz. In imaging and
electrophysiological recordings, such correlation information could be readily
extracted from the activity of mitral and tufted cells the output neurons of
the olfactory bulb. Furthermore, temporal correlation of odour concentrations
reliably predicted whether odorants emerged from the same or different sources
in naturalistic environments with complex airflow. Experiments in which mice
were trained on such tasks and probed using synthetic correlated stimuli at
different frequencies suggest that mice can use the temporal structure of
odours to extract information about space. Thus, the mammalian olfactory system
has access to unexpectedly fast temporal features in odour stimuli. This endows
animals with the capacity to overcome key behavioural challenges such as odour
source separation, figure ground segregation and odour localization by
extracting information about space from temporal odour dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;A chemistry professor at Northeastern University in Boston, MA who has almost 70 papers flagged on PubPeer resigned yesterday, May 4, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On his blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://forbetterscience.com/2020/03/19/thomas-webster-to-save-the-world-with-covid-19-nanoparticles/&quot;&gt;For Better Science&lt;/a&gt; (Update May 5, at the bottom), Leonid Schneider shared an email from the Chair of the Department of Engineering, which states that Thomas J Webster has resigned from the university. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Webster has &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Thomas+J+Webster%22&quot;&gt;69 papers flagged on PubPeer&lt;/a&gt;, mostly for concerns about image irregularities. I reported 59 to the journals and institution in March 2020. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-2562&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of these papers, which appeared to have duplications of features within the same photo, were quietly corrected. Perhaps coincidentally, these had been published in the  Elsevier journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.elsevier.com/nanomedicine-nanotechnology-biology-and-medicine/editorial-board&quot;&gt;Nanomedicine : Nanotechnology, Biology, and Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, where Webster is an Associate Editor. See e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/582FCA40E662923EAC611828E80CBE&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The apparent duplications in the colorful image on the right below this text were &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C&quot;&gt;explained by the first author on PubPeer &lt;/a&gt;as  “&lt;em&gt;the voltage of the instrument is not insufficient in that time, so that the carbon membrane (which was bought homemade) on the copper screen may affect the background and the resolution of the picture, which leads to this fuzzy image, bringing you some identification troubles&lt;/em&gt;” —  sort of blaming me for seeing these duplications. You may remember that I awarded the journal a &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2020/11/15/nanomedicine-nanotechnology-biology-and-medicine-wins-third-this-image-is-fine-award/&quot;&gt;This Image Is Fine Award&lt;/a&gt; in November 2020. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The image got replaced with something less obnoxious, without the journal even blinking when the authors wrote &lt;em&gt;“there was an inadvertent mistake for Figure 3, B which appeared as a replicated image”&lt;/em&gt;. In my professional opinion, both images contain duplicated parts — and both papers should have been retracted. But the journal had a severe conflict of interest in both cases. One of the senior authors is an Associate Editor at the journal, so the papers were not handled according to COPE guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-2567&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;2567&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm.png?w=840&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;2664,1250&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.com/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3-15-32-pm/&quot; src=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-05-at-3.15.32-pm.png?w=1024&quot; /&gt;Two examples of papers with severe image concerns, published in a journal where one of the senior author serves on the Editorial Board. In both cases, the authors were allowed to replace these figures with a clean panel, and the paper got a correction. From: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/582FCA40E662923EAC611828E80CBE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://pubpeer.com/publications/582FCA40E662923EAC611828E80CBE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://pubpeer.com/publications/8994973E1DC6C384321CBAC47F273C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several other papers with image problems were published in Dove’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dovepress.com/journal-editor-international-journal-of-nanomedicine-eic5&quot;&gt;International Journal of Nanomedicine&lt;/a&gt;, where Webster is the founding Editor-in-Chief, and not surprisingly these have not been acted upon. It is always complicated to investigate such cases if one of the authors is the founding father of the journal. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the muddy corrections at the journals, it has to be said that Northeastern University appears to have handled this case appropriately and swiftly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As reported by For Better Science, the Webster lab was suspended in November 2020, and now in May 2021 Webster has left the university. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, only 8 of these 69 papers have been corrected so far (and as we have seen above, that was not always a good decision), while as of today zero papers have been retracted. I hope the university will contact the journals with the findings of their investigation, advising them which of these cases involved research misconduct. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness — in basic terms, the practice of being “present” in the moment and paying attention to one’s own thoughts and feelings — has seen something of a boom over the last few years. In the United States, the mindfulness business is set to reach a value of $2 billion by next year, while in the United Kingdom, lockdown &lt;a href=&quot;https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/wellbeing/mindfulness-apps-coronavirus-lockdown-explained-chilled-headspace-448667&quot;&gt;saw a spike in downloads for digital meditation offerings&lt;/a&gt; such as Headspace and Calm. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But is mindfulness all it’s cracked up to be? While it certainly has its benefits, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/14/the-mindfulness-conspiracy-capitalist-spirituality&quot;&gt;some argue&lt;/a&gt; that it encourages blind acceptance of the status quo, taking us so far into ourselves that we forget the rest of the world. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/xhyua/&quot;&gt;a new preprint&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;PsyArxiv&lt;/em&gt;, Michael Poulin and colleagues from New York’s University at Buffalo also find that mindfulness can decrease prosocial behaviours — at least for those who see themselves as independent from others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-42014&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first study was designed to look at the impact of mindfulness on prosocial activity, and in particular whether this depends on a person’s “self-construal”. In short, if someone has an independent self-construal they see the self as separate from others, rather than thinking more collectively and conceptualising themselves as part of a wider group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions, one oriented around mindfulness meditation, and the other focusing on a control meditation in the form of mind wandering. Those in the mindfulness condition listened to a tape designed to induce mindfulness through mindful breathing, while those in the mind wandering condition were instructed to “let your mind wander and think freely without needing to focus hard on anything in particular”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After listening to the tapes, participants read about a local poverty and homelessness charity, before being asked whether or not they wanted to stuff envelopes in support of the organisation. Participants who decided to take part were left to do so for as long as they wanted. The team also measured participants’ self-construal by asking them to indicate how much they identified with friends, family, and wider groups compared to how much they thought of themselves as independent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most participants (84%) stuffed at least some envelopes after the task, though the number varied significantly  —  some stuffed up to 158, while others did just one. People who participated in the mindfulness meditation stuffed 15% more envelopes than those who did the control mediation — if they had an interdependent self-construal. But for those with independent self-construals, mindfulness &lt;em&gt;decreased&lt;/em&gt; the number of envelopes stuffed by 15%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second study replicated the first: this time, however, the team attempted to manipulate participants’ self-construal. Participants were asked to go through a paragraph selecting all of the pronouns. In the independent condition, participants selected singular pronouns (“&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; went to the city”) and in the interdependent condition, they selected plural pronouns (“&lt;em&gt;we &lt;/em&gt;went to the city”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the second study took place online, participants were not asked to stuff envelopes, but instead to sign up (or not) for time slots to chat online with alumni donors to request financial support for the same charity. And similar to the results of the first study, those primed with independent self-construal were less likely to volunteer after listening to the mindfulness exercise, while those in the interdependent condition saw an increased likelihood of volunteering after the mindfulness task.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other research has found similar results; one 2017 study, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/17/mindfulness-training-does-not-foster-empathy-and-can-even-make-narcissists-worse/&quot;&gt;found that mindfulness did not have the empathy-boosting benefits&lt;/a&gt; that many of its adherents had claimed, at least in those high in narcissistic traits. This latter finding seems key: as in this study, it may not be that mindfulness decreases empathy or prosocial behaviours across the board, but only in combination with particular personality types. After all, interdependent participants saw an &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; in prosocial behaviours, not a decrease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developing a more nuanced view of the benefits of mindfulness, then, might be one way of dealing with this issue. Following its meteoric rise, mindfulness has often been positioned as a panacea, not only for anxiety or other mental health conditions but in other areas, too: productivity, creativity, personal relationships, and particular traits or habits. Rather than treating it as a wholesale good, however, it may be better to understand when mindfulness might be truly beneficial — and, importantly, for whom. &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emily Chenette, Editor-in-Chief, PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS empowers researchers to transform science by offering more options for credit, transparency and choice. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/submit-your-lab-and-study-protocols-plos-one/&quot;&gt;launch&lt;/a&gt; of Lab Protocols and Study Protocols in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year supported this crucial goal by bringing reproducibility and transparency to research, and enabling those who contributed to study design to receive credit for their contributions.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re delighted to share the news that two Study Protocols have now been published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249435&quot;&gt;Satoru Joshita and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, describes a protocol for studying the prevalence and etiology of portopulmonary hypertension in a cohort of Japanese people with chronic liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248791&quot;&gt;John Cole and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, provides the protocol for the Copy Number Variation and Stroke (CaNVAS) Risk and Outcome study. This study aims to identify copy-number variations that are associated with a risk of ischemic stroke in diverse populations. &lt;/p&gt;


      &lt;div class=&quot; block-image-text block-image-text--left&quot; id=&quot;block-image-text--block_6092e00c8ebdc&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__image  block-image-text__image--25&quot;&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;379&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/cole-john-head.jpg&quot; width=&quot;263&quot; /&gt;
                      &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__text&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Cole writes, “Very little is known about the genetics of stroke outcome. In CaNVAS, copy number variation (CNV) variation as associated with both stroke-risk and-outcome will be explored on a large scale basis. Providing the scientific community with the CaNVAS protocol early in the study will help identify other researchers interested in these efforts, with the goal to increase collaboration and scientific discovery regarding CNV throughout the project.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    


&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, by having their Study Protocols reviewed and published, these authors have had the opportunity to ensure that their study designs are robust and reproducible before the research is completed. They’re also contributing to reducing publication bias by sharing the study aims before the results are available. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in submitting your own Study Protocol for consideration, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-study-protocols&quot;&gt;Submission Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; have more information about the submission and review process. One author-friendly feature of Study Protocols is that they are eligible for expedited review if the study has received funding after peer review from an external funding source. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also encourage researchers to share their detailed, verified research methodology by publishing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-lab-protocols&quot;&gt;Lab Protocol&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;. This unique article type was developed in partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://protocols.io&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt;, and consists of two interlinked components: 1) a step-by-step protocol on protocols.io, with access to specialized tools for communicating methodological details and facilitating use of the protocol; and 2) a peer-reviewed &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; article contextualizing the protocol, with sections discussing applications, limitations and expected results. Several Lab Protocols are under review right now, and we look forward to publishing the first article soon! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thank you to our authors, reviewers, editors and readers for contributing to these article types and supporting Open Science at &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If somebody else has treated you badly, what are the best strategies for overcoming this, and moving on?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There has been, of course, an enormous amount of research in this field, in relation to everything from getting over a romantic break-up to coping with the after-effects of civil war. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-64856-001&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition&lt;/em&gt;, led by Saima Noreen at De Montfort University, specifically investigates how different types of forgiveness towards an offender can help people who are intentionally trying to forget an unpleasant incident.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41993&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, “intentional forgetting” involves actively trying to suppress memories of an unpleasant experience. Recent studies have suggested that this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(18)30177-3?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364661318301773?showall=true&quot;&gt;lessens the associated negative emotions&lt;/a&gt;. Forgiveness has been more extensively investigated, and there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255965714_Forgiveness_interventions_and_the_promotion_of_resilience_following_interpersonal_stress_and_trauma&quot;&gt;work finding that forgiving the perpetrator helps&lt;/a&gt; (though of course not all victims feel able or willing to forgive, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/invisible-illness/does-healing-from-trauma-require-forgiveness-e5906fdf0149&quot;&gt;forgiveness is not an essential component of recovery&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Noreen and her colleagues set out to explore possible interactions between intentional forgetting and “decisional” vs “emotional” forgiveness. Decisional forgiveness is making the decision to forgive the perpetrator, and not to seek revenge — indeed, even to make efforts to maintain a relationship — but while still bearing a grudge. In contrast, emotional forgiveness involves getting rid of negative emotions towards the perpetrator and replacing them with positive ones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In initial studies, the team presented online participants with this scenario: just as they are about to move in with their partner, they discover that their partner is having an affair. Participants were then encouraged to forget details  associated with this hypothetical unpleasant experience (e.g. a list of adjectives that described the offender). Some were also instructed to forgive the offender either through emotional forgiveness (to “wish that the offender experiences something positive or healing and to focus their thoughts and feelings on empathy”) or decisional forgiveness (“think of the offender as someone who has behaved badly and that you have resolved not to pay her/him back and to treat him/her in a positive, rather than a negative way”.)  Others had no forgiveness intervention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team found that participants in the emotional forgiveness group showed greater forgetting of the detail, though not the gist, of the offence than the other groups. These participants also reported feeling more psychological distance from the offence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These studies involved hypothetical offences, however. For the final online, two-stage study, the team recruited 360 fresh participants. In the first of two sessions, these people were guided to write in detail about a time in their life when someone close to them had done something that deeply offended, harmed or hurt them and that still left them feeling angry or resentful. Next, they rated various aspects of this experience, including the extent to which they had forgiven the perpetrator.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 7 and 11 days later, these participants then completed the second session. This included the same three-group forgiveness intervention as in the earlier studies. The team’s analysis revealed that for these participants, emotional, but not decisional, forgiveness was associated with greater forgetting of the detail of the original transgression (though again not the gist of it). It was also associated with a shift to reporting feeling more forgiveness for the perpetrator.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Collectively, our findings suggest that the act of emotional forgiveness leads to a transgression becoming more psychologically distant, such that victims will construe the event at a higher and more abstract level,” the team writes. (In other words, retaining the gist, but not all the detail). “This high-level construal, in turn, promotes larger intentional forgetting effects, which, in turn, promote increased emotional forgiveness,” they go on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This research does support some earlier suggestions that to function as a coping strategy, forgiveness should take an emotional form. And there are clear potential implications for strategies designed to help people recover psychologically from an offence. However, more work is clearly needed to explore this apparent “virtuous circle”, and to get a better handle on potential effects in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-64856-001&quot;&gt;Moving on or deciding to let go? A pathway exploring the relationship between emotional and decisional forgiveness and intentional forgetting.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;To image neurons in vivo with a large field of view, a large objective is necessary. This big piece of metal and glass is in indirect contact with the brain surface, with only water and maybe a cover slip in between. The objective touching the brain effectively results in local cooling of the brain surface through heat conduction (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/47324&quot;&gt;Roche et al., eLife, 2019&lt;/a&gt;; see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.00557.2012&quot;&gt;Kalmbach and Waters, J Neurophysiology, 2012&lt;/a&gt;). Is this a problem?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is: Cooling by only few degrees can result in a drop of capillary blood flow and some side-effects (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/47324&quot;&gt;Roche et al., eLife, 2019&lt;/a&gt;). And it has also been shown (in slice work) that minor temperatures changes can affect the activity of astrocytic microdomains (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006349520308493&quot;&gt;Schmidt and Oheim, Biophysical J, 2020&lt;/a&gt;), which might in turn affect neuronal plasticity or even neuronal activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a specific experiment, I wanted to briefly test how such a temperature drop affects my results. Roche et al. used a commercial &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oko-lab.com/live-cell-imaging/objective-heater&quot;&gt;objective heating device&lt;/a&gt; with temperature controller, and a brief email exchange with senior author &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurotree.org/beta/peopleinfo.php?pid=9038&quot;&gt;Serge Charpak&lt;/a&gt; was quite helpful to get started. However, the tools used by Roche et al. are relatively expensive. In addition, they used a fancy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omega.co.uk/pptst/5TC.html&quot;&gt;thermocouple&lt;/a&gt; element together with a specialized amplifier from National Instruments to probe the temperature below the objective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since this was only a brief test experiment, I was hesitant to buy expensive equipment that would maybe never be used again. As a first attempt, I wrapped a heating pad, which is normally used to keep the temperature of mice during anesthesia at physiological levels, around the objective; however, the immersion medium below the objective could only heated up to something like 28°C, which is quite a bit below the desired 37°C.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6792&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6792&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;heating_pad&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1000,606&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/heating_pad-2/&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heating_pad.jpg?w=1000&quot; /&gt;Heating pad, wrapped around a 16x water immersion objective. Not hot enough.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I got in touch with Martin Wieckhorst, a very skilled technician from my institute. He suggested a more effective heating of the objective by using a very simple solution. After a layer of insulation tape (Kapton tape, see picture below), we wrapped a constantan wire, which he had available from another project, in spirals around the objective body, followed again by a layer of insulation tape. Then, using a lab power supply, we just sent some current (ca. 1A at 10 V) through the wire. The wire acts as a resistor – therefore it is important that adjacent spirals do not touch each other – and produces simply heat that is taken up by the objective body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6794&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6794&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;constantan&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1000,641&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/constantan/&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/constantan.jpg?w=1000&quot; /&gt;Constantan wire wrapped in spirals around the objective body. Semi-transparent Kapton tape used for insulation makes the wires barely visible on this picture.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To measure the temperature below the objective, we needed a sensor as small as possible. A typical thermometer head would simply not fit into the space between objective and brain surface. We decided to use a thermistor or RTD (resistance temperature detectors). How can we read out the resistance and convert it into temperature? Fortunately, Martin found an old heating block which contained a temperature controller (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.watlow.com/-/media/documents/user-manuals/series-965-eng-c.ashx&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;). These controllers are typically capable to use information from standardized  thermistors of different kinds or thermocouples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we bought the sensor itself, a PT100 thermistor (I think it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn-reichelt.de/documents/datenblatt/B400/M310_EN.pdf&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) with a very small spatial footprint. The connection from the PT100 to the temperature controller is pretty straightforward once you understand the connection scheme based on three wires (&lt;a href=&quot;https://control.com/textbook/continuous-temperature-measurement/thermistors-and-resistance-temperature-detectors-rtds/&quot;&gt;explained here&lt;/a&gt;). This three-wire scheme serves to eliminate the effect of the electrical resistance of the cables on the measurement. Then, we dipped the head of the PT100 into non-corrosive hot glue in order to prevent a shortcut of the PT100 resistor once it dips into the immersion medium. The immersion medium is at least partially conductive and would therefore affect the measure resistance and also the measured temperature. Once we had everything set up, we checked the functionality of the sensor in a water bath, using a standard thermometer for calibration. Another way to perform this calibration would be an ice bath, which is stably at 0°C. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6796&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;6796&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;thermosensor&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg?w=640&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1000,666&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://gcamp6f.com/thermosensor/&quot; src=&quot;https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/thermosensor.jpg?w=1000&quot; /&gt;A repurposed heating block to read out a thermistor. We first looked up the data sheet of the built-in controller (bottom right) and then connected a PT100 thermosensor to its inputs. The PT100 sensor is located at the tiny end of the blue cable (inset), covered by a thin film of non-corrosive hot glue.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The contact surface of my objective with the immersion medium is mostly glass and a bit of plastic, therefore it took roughly 30-60 min until the temperature below the objective reached a stable value of around 37°C. In order to prevent that the heat is distributed throughout the whole microscope, we used a plastic objective holder that does not conduct heat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, I found this small project very instructive. First, I was surprised to learn how reliable and fast an objective heater based on simple resistive wire can be. Heating up the metal part of the objective up to &amp;gt;60°C within minutes was no problem. It took however much longer until the non-metal parts of the objective also reached the desired temperature. I was also glad to see that the objective (16x Nikon) was not damaged and its resolution during imaging was not affected by its increased temperature! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem of designing a very small temperature sensor was more complicated, also due to the standard three-wire scheme to measure with thermistors. However, all components that we used were relatively cheap, and I think that these temperature measurement devices are interesting tools that could be used also for other experiments, e.g., to monitor body temperature or to build custom-made temperature controllers of water bath temperature for slice experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not possible to reliably predict the emotions someone is experiencing based just on their facial expressions. &lt;/strong&gt;And yet tech companies are trying to do just that. At &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/04/artificial-intelligence-misreading-human-emotion/618696/&quot;&gt;Kate Crawford explores some of these attempts&lt;/a&gt; — and the contested research on which they are based.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41955&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/04/covid-19-brain-fog-inspires-search-causes-and-treatments&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelly Servick takes a look at&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; attempts to understand and treat the “brain fog” experienced by some COVID-19 survivors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short sessions of unconscious bias training are unlikely to produce any long-term changes in the workplace. &lt;/strong&gt;But many researchers believe that we’ve been too quick to simply dismiss these courses, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/apr/25/what-unconscious-bias-training-gets-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it&quot;&gt;writes David Robson&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Observer&lt;/em&gt;: instead, we should understand what they get wrong and what they get right, and use this knowledge to develop better solutions for combating bias.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is free will an illusion? Does it even matter? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/apr/27/the-clockwork-universe-is-free-will-an-illusion&quot;&gt;Oliver Burkeman explores&lt;/a&gt; what philosophy, psychology and neuroscience have to say in a long read at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have developed a method to predict whether a psychedelic compound will produce hallucinations&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01156-y&quot;&gt;reports Ariana Remmel&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. The technique involves using a fluorescent sensor to determine exactly how the molecule will bind to a particular serotonin receptor in the brain. The method could be useful for finding non-hallucinogenic psychedelics for the treatment of mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has the pandemic affected those living with obsessive compulsive disorder?&lt;/strong&gt; Although early on some researchers were worried that public health measures like hand washing could make certain symptoms worse, the data suggests that that’s not the case, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/no-ocd-in-a-pandemic-doesnt-necessarily-get-worse-with-all-that-extra-hand-washing-157961&quot;&gt;write Carey Wilson and Thibault Renoid&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;. However, the pandemic may have increased general feelings of anxiety and stress among some people with OCD, similar to effects on people with other mental health conditions.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, the Association of British Science is holding an &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.absw.org.uk/events/19-don-t-be-fooled-going-beyond-face-value-in-psychology&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;online event with psychologist Lisa DeBruine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; May&lt;/strong&gt;. DeBruine will be talking about the replication crisis and the work of the Psychological Science Accelerator. For a primer, look check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22360363/replication-crisis-psychological-science-accelerator&quot;&gt;Brian Resnick’s recent piece&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-33/october-2020/massive-collaboration&quot;&gt;Jon Brock’s story&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Psychologist &lt;/em&gt;from last year.&lt;/p&gt;

 Roll out of first open access books fully funded by Opening the Future

We're thrilled to announce that our Opening the Future library membership programme has reached the threshold needed to begin funding the first titles in open access.

The Opening the Future platform is a CEU Press and COPIM initiative, launched earlier this year to facilitate transitioning the entire monograph program of CEU Press into open access together with its partners Project MUSE, LYRASIS and Jisc. Within the model, which is a first of its kind, CEU Press provides access to portions of their highly-regarded backlist, to which members subscribe. The revenue from these subscriptions is allocated entirely to allow the frontlist to be OA from the date of publication.

Words in Space and Time: Historical Atlas of Language Politics in Modern Central Europe by Dr Tomasz Kamusella will be the first title to be published OA through the programme. The atlas, available this autumn, offers novel insights into the history and mechanics of Central Europe’s languages as products of human history and a part of culture. It includes forty-two annotated and interactive maps.

Further titles will be announced soon and advance notice will be given to avoid any doubledipping.

Opening the Future is a simple and cost-effective way for libraries to support OA books for HSS subjects especially. With 250 libraries, each participating at appropriate pricing tiers in the model, CEU Press can publish 25 OA books at a cost of 11 EUR / 13 USD / 10 GBP per monograph for each library (if we reach our targets).

“With the Opening the Future model, CEU Press and COPIM developed a fair pricing system in the true sense of the word “fair” that allows libraries of all sizes and budgets to support OA monograph publishing in a sustainable way,” said Curtis Brundy, Associate University Librarian for Scholarly Communication and Collections at Iowa State University, a member of the OtF programme.

“During the past five years, the move toward open access for all publicly-funded research publications has become a new norm and goal. CEU Press with its own OtF project trailblazes this new ground as a leader in this regard,” said Dr Tomasz Kamusella, Reader at the University of St. Andrews, UK.

More Information

For libraries or other institutions that want to support the move to immediate OA, without author-facing charges, more information can be found at https://ceup.openingthefuture.net/. For further details on the pricing and structure of the model, see the FAQs and resources web pages.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Author: Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, PLOS’ Director of Open Research Solutions&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Early career researchers again appear to be at the vanguard of open research, with them reporting more positive attitudes towards sharing of code compared to more experienced researchers – as found in PLOS research released as a&lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/f73a6/&quot;&gt; preprint this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the end of March 2021 &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008867&quot;&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; a more stringent policy on sharing code associated with articles published in the journal. This was in response to a desire of members of the journal’s community to go further to promote open science, which appears to be reflected in the community at large – determined through collaborative research between PLOS and the journal’s community of editors and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008725&quot;&gt;more than 40%&lt;/a&gt; of papers published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology &lt;/em&gt;voluntarily shared their code already, &lt;em&gt;requiring&lt;/em&gt; more authors to share more of their research outputs as a condition of publication is not a decision to be taken lightly by any journal. Therefore, to better understand the attitudes and experiences of the computational biology community in relation to code sharing, we designed a survey to help us understand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is a mandatory code sharing policy suitable for researchers in the community?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What proportion of researchers’ papers generate code?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What concerns do they have about code sharing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How common are these concerns?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How much would submissions to the journal be affected?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are there differences in different segments of researchers (regions, disciplines, career stages)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Supporting the editorial announcing the policy and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13366025&quot;&gt;survey dataset&lt;/a&gt; that were released in March, a more in-depth analysis of our survey of more than 200 researchers has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/f73a6/&quot;&gt;released as a preprin&lt;/a&gt;t. As well as supporting the journal’s plans, we hope this work will be a resource for other stakeholders considering adoption of new policies on sharing of code. Along with research data and protocols, sharing of code is important to help ensure research is reusable and reproducible but, as we discovered when developing the policy, there is limited evidence on the prevalence of code sharing – relative to other open research practices such as data sharing – and researchers’ experiences with sharing code and software.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors surveyed report that, on average, 71% of their research articles have associated code, and that for the average author, code has not been shared for 32% of these papers. A lot of researchers had not shared their code in the past due to practical or technical issues such as insufficient time, skills or systems dependencies, which — at least in principle — would not prevent compliance with a mandatory code sharing policy. Twenty two percent of respondents who had not shared their code in the past, however, cited intellectual property (IP) concerns — a legitimate issue that might prevent public sharing of code under a mandatory policy. In combination with these survey results and testing draft versions of the policy with researchers in the field, we concluded that an inclusive policy would need to permit exemptions in certain cases. However, the results also implied that more of the respondents’ previous publications could have shared code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Reasons given by respondents for not sharing code publicly in the past.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-18885&quot; height=&quot;433&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Figure-1.png&quot; width=&quot;1006&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another key finding was differences in levels of acceptance of a mandatory code sharing policy between research fields, and career stage (as determined by the number of previous publications respondents had published). Medical researchers reported being less likely to submit to the journal if it had a mandatory code sharing policy, as did researchers with more than 100 publications. Whereas, researchers with fewer than 20 published papers showed more positive responses towards submitting to the journal if it implemented a code sharing policy. Other studies have found greater affinity for open research amongst early career researchers, including a 2021 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JxnxXjJJ58?amp=1&quot;&gt;peer-reviewed survey of Early Career Researchers (ECRs) within the Max Planck society&lt;/a&gt;, which concluded ECRs seem to hold a generally positive view toward open research practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Respondents were asked “If PLOS Computational Biology required you to publicly share any computer code you created to interpret your results, how would this affect your likelihood to submit to the journal?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-18886&quot; height=&quot;249&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Figure-2.png&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/how-can-we-increase-adoption-of-open-research-practices/&quot;&gt;what we discovered about researchers’ needs and priorities for data sharing in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, respondents were satisfied with their ability to share &lt;em&gt;their own&lt;/em&gt; code but were less satisfied with their ability to access other researchers’ code. From this we infer that offering researchers new products or services to share code, at least in this community, in the absence of a stronger policy, would be unlikely to achieve the goal: of measurably increasing the availability of code with the journal’s publications. However, as with research data, we see opportunities for journals and publishers to increase findability and accessibility – and ultimately reuse – of code generated by researchers, which in turn can help realise more benefits of open research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the preprint &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/f73a6/&quot;&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;and survey dataset &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13366025&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The only absolute knowledge attainable by man is that life is meaningless,” wrote Leo Tolstoy in &lt;em&gt;A Confession&lt;/em&gt;, a succinct summing up of the nihilist worldview. Depressing as it may be, nihilism seems to be on the rise, with the importance of finding a meaningful worldview &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0027408&quot;&gt;steadily decreasing&lt;/a&gt; over the last decade or so.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But how do other people &lt;em&gt;view&lt;/em&gt; nihilists? This is the question posed by Matthew J. Scott and Adam B. Cohen of Arizona State University &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2021.1902922?src=&quot;&gt;in a new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;. They find that stereotypes of nihilists are overwhelmingly negative — and unlike stereotypes about atheists, people don’t seem to have any positive views about nihilists at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41939&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 464 participants viewed a short profile of either a fictitious man or woman, containing a picture and some information including occupation, favourite foods, hobbies, and preference for cats or dogs. The profile also outlined the person’s “pet philosophy”: they either had a nihilistic outlook (“We are here because of random events. Our lives have no purpose”) or a meaningful outlook (“We are all here for a reason. All of our lives serve a purpose”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants then rated how much the person embodied certain traits: the Big Five personality traits, “folk social value traits” which included “fun”, “energetic”, “educated”, and “trustworthy”, and the ability to fulfil social tasks including self-protection, being a good friend, attracting romantic partners, caring for family, and being interested in having children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Profiles that indicated life had a purpose were rated as more agreeable, conscientious, outgoing, and open-minded than nihilist profiles, which were in turn considered more neurotic. Similarly, the folk social value traits were all more closely associated with meaningful profiles than they were with nihilist profiles. Nihilists were also considered less competent in all social tasks except for self-protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also found that participants viewed nihilists as less religious, more depressed, and less likely to plan for the future — and that these perceptions could go some way to explaining why they had more negative views of nihilists than of those with a more meaningful outlook. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second study, involving 312 undergraduate participants, replicated the first, and came to many of the same conclusions. This time, the team also found that people had negative views of nihilists no matter what their own beliefs were on the meaning of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In three final studies, instead of using profiles of people who were or weren’t nihilists, the team showed participants profiles of people who were described as religious or non-religious, depressed or happy, or good or bad at future planning. Each of these factors was associated with negative judgements: among other findings, non-religious profiles were considered less socially competent and less conscientious; depressed profiles were seen as less extraverted and agreeable, and less able to avoid disease, attract romantic partners and look after children; and those with lower levels of future-planning were seen as less conscientious, less virtuous, and less intelligent, and less likely to be able to care for themselves and others. Together, the results of the final studies suggests that these three factors are indeed the key reason nihilists are negatively stereotyped.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results don’t paint a rosy picture when it comes to views of nihilists. Unlike &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/01/americans-simultaneously-hold-both-positive-and-negative-stereotypes-about-atheists/&quot;&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; on atheism, which found both positive and negative stereotypes of the non-religious, there also seems to be very little upside to the results — compared to people who think life has meaning, nihilists were viewed more negatively across the board.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking more closely at different kinds of nihilism might produce different results, however — the team uses the example of someone who finds the accumulation of wealth meaningless, which may come with more positive stereotypes. It’s also perfectly possible that someone might believe life itself has no inherent purpose but has nonetheless developed their own sense of meaning. Looking more closely at people’s personal webs of meaning may reveal more nuanced attitudes, challenging broader stereotypes of how a “nihilist” thinks, feels, and behaves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2021.1902922?src=&quot;&gt;Stereotypes of nihilists are overwhelmingly negative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/Refugee-health-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), like cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, represent the primary cause of mortality worldwide. An increasing volume of NCDs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) now accounts for the majority of recent surges in the global NCD burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, increasing humanitarian crises in LMICs have resulted in the global forced displacement of people reaching record highs, with the average length of displacement now greater than 20 years. Until recently, the problem of NCDs in conflict-affected populations was largely neglected. However, with growing awareness of the challenges NCDs represent in humanitarian settings, clinical guidance has been developed for chronic NCD care in LMICs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, the non-governmental organization (NGO) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Médecins Sans Frontières&lt;/em&gt; (MSF)&lt;/a&gt; has supported the Jordanian health system by providing multidisciplinary, primary level NCD care to Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanians living in Irbid, Jordan. This week in &lt;em&gt;BMC Health Services Research&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-021-06333-3&quot;&gt;Ansbro &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;describe their experiences with MSF, adapting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.re-aim.org/about/what-is-re-aim/&quot;&gt;RE-AIM framework&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate MSF’s program of NCD care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RE-AIM is a framework consisting of five elements, &lt;em&gt;Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance&lt;/em&gt;. The framework was originally developed to encourage program planners, evaluators, funders, and policy-makers to be more attentive to essential program elements, to improve sustainable adoption, and promote the implementation of effective, generalizable, evidence-based interventions. In this study, through the use of mixed methods, Ansbro &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; examined the RE-AIM five key elements of the MSF Syrian refugee NCD program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_12355&quot; style=&quot;width: 410px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12355 size-full&quot; height=&quot;363&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/RE-AIM_resized-e1619620846606.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Image Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2014.00143/full&quot;&gt;Ory &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; (2015)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reach, Effectiveness, and Adoption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most areas of the program were viewed as acceptable to patients, staff, and stakeholders. Although the care was free, patients were burdened with indirect costs, like paying for transport, to attend clinics, potentially outweighing the benefits of ‘free’ care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program achieved good clinical outcomes for treating patients with hypertension and diabetes. However, more research in the future that uses longer follow-up periods is needed to understand the prevalence or outcomes of major complications of NCDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key challenge for implementation was the impact of Syrian patients’ experiences of war, loss, and social suffering on their engagement with NCD care. Staff also shared concerns that they could not manage medical problems in isolation from the psychosocial issues patients faced and they felt ill-equipped to handle patients’ war-related trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients and staff also reported that the referral pathways for specialist services were troublesome and confusing. Funding for specialist referral pathways was limited, even though MSF managed to secure additional funding. This highlights the need for future programs to securely implement specialist referral pathways, ensuring they are designed to be affordable and accessible from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key challenge for maintaining the program was cost. High costs were partly responsible for the program’s limited coverage and scope. However, there is room for adaptations. For example, MSF introduced nurse task sharing, which could lead to cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another challenge here is the availability of highly qualified family medicine specialists, for the management of patients with complex needs. While MSF had access to a large number of highly qualified Jordanian staff on this occasion, this is often not the case in all humanitarian crisis settings. This issue is difficult to address, but the authors propose potential workarounds, like telemedicine, as a possible solution for future programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-12357 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;175&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/Refugee-_unsplash_strip.jpg&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research in humanitarian crisis settings is extremely difficult. Not only do governments and humanitarian organizations face significant challenges in effectively tackling NCDs in LMICs, but the evaluation of interventions in humanitarian settings is equally as challenging. Still, this study demonstrated that RE-AIM is a valuable tool to guide complex interventions in humanitarian crisis settings. Ansbro &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; bridge a knowledge gap in the delivery of care in humanitarian settings, however, more research is urgently needed to strengthen responses to NCDs in humanitarian crisis settings. Future programs need to focus on simplifying care models, reducing costs, and harnessing telehealth resources.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Muhammad Yaqoob will talk about a paper &quot;Learning Compositional Sequences with Multiple Time Scales through a Hierarchical Network of Spiking Neurons&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sequential behaviour is often compositional and organised across
multiple time scales: a set of individual elements developing on short
time scales (motifs) are combined to form longer functional sequences
(syntax). Such organisation leads to a natural hierarchy that can be
used advantageously for learning, since the motifs and the syntax can
be acquired independently. Despite mounting experimental evidence for
hierarchical structures in neuroscience, models for temporal learning
based on neuronal networks have mostly focused on serial methods.
Here, we introduce a network model of spiking neurons with a
hierarchical organisation aimed at sequence learning on multiple time
scales. Using biophysically motivated neuron dynamics and local
plasticity rules, the model can learn motifs and syntax independently.
Furthermore, the model can relearn sequences efficiently and store
multiple sequences. Compared to serial learning, the hierarchical
model displays faster learning, more flexible relearning, increased
capacity, and higher robustness to perturbations. The hierarchical
model redistributes the variability: it achieves high motif fidelity
at the cost of higher variability in the between-motif timings.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/28/passion-is-linked-to-greater-academic-achievement-but-in-some-cultures-more-than-others/"/>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Passion” is a word that often crops up on job descriptions and in interviews; articles proliferate online explaining how to adequately express your passion to potential employers. On the whole, passionate people — those who have a strong interest in a particular topic, who are confident in themselves and who dedicate themselves to what they’re doing — are thought of in a positive light, and considered likely to achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to predicting achievement, how important is passion really? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/11/e2016964118&quot;&gt;According to Xingyu Li from Stanford University&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/11/e2016964118&quot;&gt;and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, writing in&lt;em&gt; PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, passion may be less important in certain cultures — and the fact that passion is often seen as the key to achievement may reflect a “distinctly Western model of motivation”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-41921&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The chief factor explored in the study was how individualistic a society was: in individualistic cultures, the team argues, people are more motivated by pursuing paths related to their passions, while those in collectivistic cultures are more likely to see themselves as part of an interdependent network, often fulfilling obligations to others rather than focusing on their own interests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data was gathered from a large international survey focusing on education, which included over 1.2 million participants from nearly sixty different countries. The survey measured academic achievement in maths, science and reading during several closed-book tests, and the team also examined the individualism or collectivism of each culture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Passion itself is hard to measure across cultures — some participant languages, including Mandarin, have no direct translation for the word as understood in the Western world. Instead, passion was measured through self-report answers on various different factors: passionate students were those who were strongly and independently motivated and who showed high levels of enjoyment, interest and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In science subjects, passion &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;positively correlated with academic achievement: those with higher levels of enjoyment, interest and efficacy also had higher test scores. But the strength of this correlation wasn’t the same across cultures: those in individualistic societies such as the US, Australia, and the UK showed a stronger link between passion and achievement than did those in more collectivistic societies such as Colombia or Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results were also mirrored in achievement in both mathematics and in reading — again, high-achieving participants from more individualistic societies were also more likely to have high levels of passion, whilst high-achieving participants from collectivistic societies were not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In order to check whether any other cultural differences could predict the link between passion and achievement, the team also looked at eight further factors that vary between cultures, including how likely people are to avoid uncertainty, whether they value simple survival over self-expression, and how indulgent they are. However, only differences in individualism vs. collectivism could explain the association between passion and achievement across cultures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s clear from the results that passion isn’t the only thing that motivates people to achieve their goals — indeed, the team also found that parental support was a crucial factor in achievement in collectivistic societies. And these findings could help with the development of educational support programmes that cater to a wider range of individuals. Rather than developing support that focuses solely on self-regulation and passion, for example, institutions could take a wider view of what motivates students to do well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to note that one type of motivation is no better than another. Although motivation from others could be seen as more extrinsic, the team writes, it “need not feel like coercive pressure from the outside”: rather than feeling overbearing, such motivation can be a source of “empowerment, persistence and resilience”. While for many students passion is key, it’s certainly worth considering the other factors that might make people tick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/11/e2016964118&quot;&gt;Passion matters but not equally everywhere: Predicting achievement from interest, enjoyment, and efficacy in 59 societies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Where are the olivary nuclei?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The olivary nuclei, which consist of the inferior olivary nucleus and superior olivary nucleus, are found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/brainstem&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brainstem&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The inferior and superior olivary nuclei are distinct in function. The inferior olivary nucleus is typically subdivided into the &lt;em&gt;principal olive, medial accessory olive, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;dorsal accessary olive&lt;/em&gt;, and is thought to play an important role in movement, coordination, and movement-related learning. The superior olivary nucleus consists of the &lt;em&gt;lateral superior olive&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;medial superior olive,&lt;/em&gt; as well as a number of surrounding nuclei known as the &lt;em&gt;periolivary nuclei&lt;/em&gt;. The superior olivary nuclei are thought to be involved in hearing, and specifically with identifying the location of sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The inferior olivary nuclei receive movement-related information from several sources, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/spinal-cord&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spinal cord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/motor-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;motor cortex&lt;/a&gt;. This includes information about current movement, body position, muscle tension, and intention. The inferior olivary nuclei use this information to communicate with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebellum&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cerebellum&lt;/a&gt; to fine-tune movements and aid in movement-related learning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The superior olivary nuclei receive projections from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cochlea&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cochlear&lt;/a&gt; nuclei that carry information about hearing. Neurons leave the superior olivary nuclei to extend to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/inferior-colliculus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inferior colliculus&lt;/a&gt;, which is an important part of the auditory system. The superior olivary nuclei receive information from both ears, and that information is compared to detect differences in qualities like intensity and to determine the location of a sound in the environment. The information is then sent to the inferior colliculus and processed further before being sent on to other regions like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thalamus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebral-cortex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cerebral cortex&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, neurons in the superior olivary nuclei project back to the cochlear nuclei. These projections are thought to be involved in negative feedback mechanisms that help to inhibit auditory stimuli that are deemed less important, such as background conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;References:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Paul MS, M Das J.

 &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2731&quot;&gt;Stevenson and Kording&lt;/a&gt; (2011), the authors estimated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://stevenson.lab.uconn.edu/scaling/&quot;&gt;every 7.4 years, the number of neurons we can record with doubles&lt;/a&gt;. Think of it as Moore’s law for brain recordings. Since then, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stevenson.lab.uconn.edu/scaling/&quot;&gt;Stevenson has updated the estimate&lt;/a&gt;, which now stands at 6 years. Could it be that progress itself is accelerating? &lt;/p&gt;

(2021)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/anne-urai/largescale_recordings&quot;&gt;under a CC-BY license&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MatteoCarandini/status/1386746176939102218&quot;&gt;Matteo Carandini raised a question&lt;/a&gt;: why should progress be log-linear anyway? Technological phenomena have been argued to follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change&quot;&gt;a double-exponential curve&lt;/a&gt;: the pace of progress itself accelerates over time. This is only noticeable when we look over a very long time horizon, for instance, when we look at computation per dollars over more than a century:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Doubling times&quot; height=&quot;528&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png/640px-Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png&quot; width=&quot;753&quot; /&gt;image &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moore%27s_Law_over_120_Years.png&quot;&gt;CC BY Steve Jurvetson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But we have 60 years to look at, so we can make these inferences! I took the data in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14662&quot;&gt;Urai et al. (2021)&lt;/a&gt; – generously released under a CC-BY license – and fit a Bayesian Poisson regression model over time (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/patrickmineault/bayesian-doubling-times&quot;&gt;code here&lt;/a&gt;). I fit only the electrophysiology data. It’s clear here that early times are underfit by the line. The doubling time estimated here is shorter than what has been noted in the literature – 4.5 years. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7621&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7621&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-8&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;775,554&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-8-2/&quot; height=&quot;269&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-8.png?w=775&quot; width=&quot;377&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A log-linear model of progress in electrophysiology&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On a technical note, a Poisson regression model will tend to give larger weight to higher numbers – hence, it focuses on fitting the right-hand side of the graph, while the linear regression model that’s conventionally used gives equal weight everywhere. With an accelerating trend, that means the Poisson regression model give a shorter doubling time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can do one better – fit a double-exponential model. This is only a few lines of code in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.pymc.io/&quot;&gt;PyMC3&lt;/a&gt; – a miracle of automatic differentiation and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Here’s what that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7617&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7617&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-6&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;779,527&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-6-2/&quot; height=&quot;276&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-6.png?w=779&quot; width=&quot;408&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can see visually this is a much better fit, and it implies something pretty dramatic: progress itself is accelerating. That means that doubling time itself has changed over time – and it currently stands at 3.6 years under this model [95% CI 3.5-3.7].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results project a 1M neuron average recording capability by 2045 – of course, this discounts ceiling effects and potential paradigm shifts, which could adjust these bounds far upward or downward. What about optical methods? It turns out that the Poisson model works poorly because of overdispersion. I used a negative binomial to model the noise in the curve. I tried to let the overdispersion parameter be free, but I was getting convergence problems. Hence I fixed it to 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7623&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7623&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image-9&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;783,527&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-9/&quot; height=&quot;257&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image-9.png?w=783&quot; width=&quot;383&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implied doubling rate is a little less than 2 years. These numbers could swing wildly as we add more data, but we see that the doubling rate for imaging is at least twice the current rate for electrodes. This is due to the market pressures in cellphone sensors and telecommunications (fiber optics and LiDAR), making good sensors very cheap. Many in neurotech have taken note, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.fb.com/imagining-a-new-interface-hands-free-communication-without-saying-a-word/&quot;&gt;including Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, which is building light-based BCIs, and Paradromics, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.209403v1&quot;&gt;adapting some of the fabrication methods from imaging sensors&lt;/a&gt; to electrophysiology. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thus, this generalized Moore’s law of recordings is likely to continue decreasing in doubling time over the foreseeable future. Does this mean recording from every cell in the brain ($10^{11}$ cells) in the next 25 years? Probably not with electrodes – but if progress with light-based sensing continues at the same pace, perhaps. There is the vexing issue of scatter – &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AdamMarblestone/status/1387018520001748995&quot;&gt;and some of the people in this thread have some ideas on how to solve this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the exact course of progress, I think that 7 years is far too long a doubling time – perhaps 3.5 years for ephys, 2 years for imaging. The future ain’t what it used to be, and it’s coming far faster than we’ve perhaps imagined. What will we do with all this data? There’s some great hints in the Urai paper. An interesting research question si how holographic the brain is – perhaps we will get most of the understanding with far less than 100% coverage. Regardless, I think Adam Calhoun put it best:&lt;/p&gt;

These are doubling times are nevertheless shorter than the ones reported previously in the literature so far, so the larger point still stands: the future is happening faster than we thought just a few years ago. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ihstevenson/status/1387439844641628161&quot;&gt;Read the thread here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;PLOS announces new journals&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-18866&quot; height=&quot;630&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/PLOS-Blogs-New-journal-announcment3-1.gif&quot; width=&quot;1120&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are extremely excited to announce the imminent launch of &lt;strong&gt;five new journals&lt;/strong&gt;, our first new launches in fourteen years. These new journals are unified in addressing global health and environmental challenges and are rooted in the full values of Open Science:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/climate&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Climate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Sustainability and Transformation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/water&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Digital Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Global Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, before we go on, let’s address this: “Yet more journals?” (Yes, we heard you…!)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. We set out, with our original &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/publish/submit/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;seven journals&lt;/a&gt;, to transform research communication by making research content openly accessible. &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Over the eighteen years since our first journal launch&lt;/a&gt; we’ve helped prove the viability of Open Access which, despite the occasional disagreement about how best to achieve it, is now a mainstream notion. We changed the publishing landscape via &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, and this new type of “mega-journal” now features at almost every publisher and in every research field. We helped focus the conversation about peer review on rigor and transparency, and more people now understand how impact-seeking should never be at the expense of these notions. And, via open data policies, open peer review options, protocols, preregistration, preprint facilitation, etc., we’ve worked towards Open Science at a scale and in ways that increase the transparency and rigor of the &lt;strong&gt;entire research communication process&lt;/strong&gt;, not just our journals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All this is to say that we do not take lightly the responsibility of introducing new journals into the world. While we don’t believe the long-term future of research communication is always going to be the journal as we know it today, we do appreciate the impacts that journals can still have, and the new &lt;strong&gt;communities of practice &lt;/strong&gt;they can empower. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we are launching these five journals in the spirit of them being additional &lt;strong&gt;change-making vehicles&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve invited key members of the PLOS Leadership Team along with our CEO, Alison Mudditt, to field specific questions, below: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Why launch new journals at this point in PLOS’ journey?” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Niamh O’Connor, Chief Publishing Officer, PLOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re a nonprofit, driven by our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/dei/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;, and we need to adapt to continue to deliver on it. Even though Open Access is now widely adopted, and Open Science is advancing, there are still key voices missing. We are expanding our global footprint in locally responsible ways to get closer to researchers. Researchers have always driven our mission forward, and in order for us to have a meaningful impact we need to include the broadest range of their voices, globally. This way, we ensure the co-creation of paths to Open Science that work for diverse communities and do not simply extend existing power structures. These new journals create new and diverse communities of practice, and ensure that they are at the forefront of shaping how we address the most pressing health and environmental issues facing our society. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, all these journals will be underpinned by our existing, and new, institutional business models that move beyond the APC to ensure more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access publishing. Our existing institutional models are our &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Community Action Publishing (CAP)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flat Fee agreement&lt;/a&gt; models. We’ll talk more about our brand new models when the journals open for submissions, suffice to say that they are also not based on APCs. With all this said, author fee-based models will still be available for those authors who prefer or need them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What are the special characteristics of these new journals?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan Shanahan, Publishing Director, PLOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As Niamh says, our next phase of work is not just about Open Access. These new journals not only complement and naturally extend the existing PLOS suite of journals, but will hardwire a lens of social responsibility into sharing research. Via these new journals we can work together to address the most pressing ‘Openness’ issue specific to each field, and enable the researchers addressing these challenges, everywhere, to have the broadest impact. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In full alignment with the proposed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science&lt;/a&gt;, these titles will ensure diversity and equity of representation at all levels – editors, editorial boards, reviewers, authors – and will actively seek out research from under-represented communities. The journals will play a part in broader efforts to create a more equitable system of knowledge-sharing, accelerating and increasing the benefits of scientific endeavour for global society as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new journals all focus on some of the world’s most globally-relevant issues, to which locally-relevant research can, and must, become more visible. This approach will directly challenge the unfortunate norm that most ‘global’ forums remain dominated by research from Western Europe and North America.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“How will these journals contribute to the increased adoption of Open Science practices?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Veronique Kiermer, Chief Scientific Officer, PLOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“PLOS has always led on key Open Science matters, we are experimenters, but we’re also striving to be better listeners. We know a rigid approach to Open Science won’t foster equitable participation from all communities. As a publisher, we’ve never been driven by tradition, but by a willingness to question the status quo and an eagerness to explore how we can understand and improve the system. We’ll continue to investigate and test new ways of sharing, assessing, and recognizing research. We’ll be partnering with leaders across research communities, and the Open Science communities, to enact change. Not every solution will be journal-shaped, but all our journals will be shaped by Open Science, enabling those who publish with us to join communities of practice. We can use our newly expanded journal portfolio to influence norms and advance Open Science practices in considered and appropriate ways. We stand firm on any policies like open data that promote rigor and advance trust in research, but we want to understand the specific challenges that such policies represent for new communities, and work with them to find solutions that empower them, in their contexts, to practice Open Science. Overall, we want to further empower new communities to join us and inform us, working more tightly together towards ever more trust in science.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“How does this expansion of the portfolio fit into PLOS’ wider aims for the future?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alison Mudditt, Chief Executive Officer, PLOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“PLOS has grown, times have changed, and how we deliver our mission has to evolve. Science is a global, collaborative enterprise. Challenging times help us see where we are and where we need to be. Global collaboration, transparency, and trust in science (and policies…and interventions…)  have all become recurring themes. We’re also coming to terms with how we, as a society, need to do a lot more to address systemic barriers to inclusion. How we think of ourselves as an organization, especially a research communication organization, isn’t separate from everything else going on in the world today. We have always worked to raise the bar for Openness. To continue this work we need to continue to grow – but not just in the traditional business sense, and not just in counting the number of journals we publish: we also need to, and have concrete plans to, spread our roots deeper, create more global hubs for PLOS, absorb researchers’ local practices more fully into our business, and, as others commented before me, ensure that any journal we publish is informed by local communities at a global scale, challenging problems, and rebuilding the system better.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch these spaces!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have Editors in place, we have dedicated staff, and the journals will open for submissions a little later this year. All updated information will appear on the respective journal websites (linked from the list above) as the journals take shape. Visit them often for submission guidelines, how our editorial boards are developing, how to apply to be a member of the board, where to follow them on social media, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/1GkvF8JqjjU/"/>
		<id>https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18831</id>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS note:&lt;/strong&gt; We are delighted to share this announcement by the MDAR Working Group &lt;strong&gt;(M&lt;/strong&gt;aterials, &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;esign, &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;nalysis, &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;eporting)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;of a new framework for transparent reporting in the life sciences. PLOS has always put emphasis—through editorial policies and submission guidelines—on complete and transparent reporting to facilitate the analysis, trust, reproduction and reuse of the research we publish. We’ve supported and participated in the MDAR Working Group by sharing our experience and helping to develop and test the new reporting framework. We hope that the MDAR Framework will help bring consistency to journals reporting guidelines and make it easier for authors to adopt transparency norms. The MDAR Framework is consistent with what is practiced at PLOS and we will work with our editorial boards to explore the most effective ways to implement it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Incomplete or imprecise reporting of life sciences research contributes to challenges with reproducibility, replicability, and biomedical applications. For the last three years we – a group of journal editors and researchers – have been working together to develop a new framework for transparent reporting of life sciences research. This framework has just been &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2103238118&quot;&gt;published &lt;/a&gt;in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MDAR Framework establishes the four domains – research Materials, Design, Analysis, and Reporting – in which we define both a set of basic minimum requirements, and best practice recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We were motivated to develop the MDAR Framework as part of our own and others’ attempts to improve reporting to drive research improvement and ultimately greater trust in science. Existing tools, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines&quot;&gt;ARRIVE &lt;/a&gt;guidelines, guidance from &lt;a href=&quot;https://fairsharing.org/&quot;&gt;FAIRSharing&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.equator-network.org/&quot;&gt;EQUATOR Network&lt;/a&gt;, speak to important sub-elements of biomedical research. This new MDAR Framework aims to be  more general and less deep, and therefore complements these important specialist guidelines.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous approaches have led to improved reporting, but often at considerable cost to both authors’ and editors’ time. A recent period of experimentation has resulted in a thorough but fragmented landscape of reporting guidelines for life science journals. A drive for efficiency  inspired us to learn from each other’s experiences and to harmonize the most effective practices. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MDAR Framework provides flexibility along with broad applicability. The standard articulation of expectations across different journals will make it easier for: (i) authors to better understand what is expected of them, and (ii) for more journals to adopt an established approach rather than develop it from scratch. Journals can choose a level of implementation appropriate to their needs, enabling greater adoption potential. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also hope that the MDAR Framework will be helpful for other organizations such as funders, who can signal reporting expectations early and therefore have an effect at the time the studies are designed, and tool/software developers, who can devise means of facilitating compliance for authors and journals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside the framework, the project provides a checklist (for authors, journals or reviewers) as an optional implementation tool, and an explanation and elaboration document. The checklist was piloted on over 289 manuscript submissions across 13 journals, seeking feedback from authors and editors actually using the checklist. Our team analysed agreement between observers, sought feedback from outside experts, and revised the framework in the light of this experience. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The full set of MDAR resources will be maintained and updated as a community resource, in a Collection on the Open Science Framework. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are sharing this update on the MDAR Framework through coordinated posts on working group member platforms. Working group members have been free to add any additional context as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

During the last 13 years of his life, Warhol put &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29125003&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thousands of collected objects&lt;/a&gt; into 610 cardboard boxes. These &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warhol.org/timecapsule/time-capsules/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Time Capsules&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were never sold as art, but they were meticulously cataloged by museum archivists and displayed in a major exhibition at the Andy Warhol Museum. “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2013/11/02/242174661/dead-bees-nail-clippings-and-priceless-art-in-warhols-time-capsules&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Warhol was a packrat&lt;/a&gt;. But that desire to collect helped inform his artistic point of view.” Yet Warhol was aware of his compulsion, and it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/27949117?seq=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;disturbed him&lt;/a&gt;: “I'm so sick of the way I live, of all this junk, and always dragging home more.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Where does the hobby of collection cross over into hoarding, and who makes this determination? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Artists get an automatic pass into the realm of collectionism, no matter their level of compulsion. The Vancouver Art Gallery held a &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20140812083317if_/http://couplandexhibition.org/home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;major exhibition&lt;/a&gt; of the works of Canadian writer and artist &lt;a href=&quot;https://coupland.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Douglas Coupland&lt;/a&gt; in 2014. One of the sections consisted of a room filled with 5,000 objects collected over 20 years and carefully arranged in a masterwork called &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2014/06/welcome-to-douglas-couplands-brain.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Brain&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here's what the collection looked like prior to assembly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NxxVGLP_HY4/YIYc8sMgKWI/AAAAAAAANS8/XnbPxcYbkgYMZGvee6UTNH-TKPm1lqyCgCLcBGAsYHQ/s736/Coupland%2527s%2BBrain.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;552&quot; data-original-width=&quot;736&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NxxVGLP_HY4/YIYc8sMgKWI/AAAAAAAANS8/XnbPxcYbkgYMZGvee6UTNH-TKPm1lqyCgCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h300/Coupland%2527s%2BBrain.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span face=&quot;Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Materials used in the &lt;i&gt;The Brain&lt;/i&gt;, 2000–2014&lt;/b&gt;, mixed-media installation with readymade objects.

Collectors may be passionate, but their obsessions/compulsions do not hinder their everyday function (or personal safety). According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/addictiondisorders/Citation/2003/02020/Collectors,_Accumulators,_Hoarders,_and_Hoarding.3.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Halperin and Glick (2003)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/div&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;“Characteristically, collectors organize their collections, which while extensive, do not make their homes dysfunctional or otherwise unlivable. They see their collections as adding a new dimension to their lives in terms of providing an area of beauty or historical continuity that might otherwise be lacking.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pcn.12853&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;differential diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; for the DSM-5 classification of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519704/table/ch3.t29/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hoarding Disorder&lt;/a&gt; vs. non-pathological Collecting considers order and value of primary importance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aTjB9ohcFdE/YIYk2P8safI/AAAAAAAANTE/tH5C3J4rWk8fC9M7wlVNWOi2CjpeMOW6QCLcBGAsYHQ/s703/Hoarding%2Bor%2BCollecting%2Bdifferential%2Bdiagnosis.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;558&quot; data-original-width=&quot;703&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aTjB9ohcFdE/YIYk2P8safI/AAAAAAAANTE/tH5C3J4rWk8fC9M7wlVNWOi2CjpeMOW6QCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Hoarding%2Bor%2BCollecting%2Bdifferential%2Bdiagnosis.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fig. 2 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pcn.12853&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nakao &amp;amp; Kanba, 2019&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;If possessions are well organized and have a specific value, the owner is deﬁned as a ‘collector.’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Medical conditions that cause secondary hoarding are excluded from Hoarding Disorder.

This process entailed flying across the country five times in a total of 20 different planes in the midst of a pandemic.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Although my mother showed some elements of  hoarding, she didn't meet clinical criteria. She had various collections of objects (e.g., glass shoes, decorator plates, snuff bottles, and ceremonial masks), but what really stood out were her &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;accumulations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — organized but excessive stockpiles of useful items such as flashlights, slippers, sweatshirts, kitchen towels, and watches (although most of the latter were no longer useful).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n2mt9g-qM_I/YIY5jkQbSKI/AAAAAAAANTU/qI0Uu0aTlfA8N0pz3E6jjhPxzsI-IDOuQCLcBGAsYHQ/s864/10%2Bpairs%2Bof%2Bunworn%2Bgardening%2Bgloves.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;767&quot; data-original-width=&quot;864&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n2mt9g-qM_I/YIY5jkQbSKI/AAAAAAAANTU/qI0Uu0aTlfA8N0pz3E6jjhPxzsI-IDOuQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/10%2Bpairs%2Bof%2Bunworn%2Bgardening%2Bgloves.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;Ten pairs of unworn gardening gloves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;During the year+ of COVID sheltering-in-place, some people wrote books, published papers, started nonprofits, engaged in fundraising, held Zoom benefit events, demonstrated for BLM, home-schooled their kids, taught classes, cared for sick household members, mourned the loss of their elder relatives, or endured COVID-19 themselves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I dealt with the loss of a parent, along with the solo task of emptying 51 years of accumulated belongings from her home. To cope with this sad and lonely and emotionally grueling task, I took photos of my mother's accumulations and collections. It became a mini-obsession unto itself. I tried to make sense of my mother's motivations, but the trauma of her suffering and the specter of an unresolved childhood were too overwhelming.

It's a misguided effort when the goal is framed so simplistically (or monolithically).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, whose brain are we trying to explain? Yours? Mine? The brain of a monkey, mouse, marsupial, monotreme, mosquito, or mollusk? Or &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; with its 306 neurons? “Yeah yeah, we get the point,” you say, “stop being so sarcastic and cynical. We're searching for core principles, first principles.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;What does “core principle” mean?&lt;/p&gt;— Andrew Pruszynski (@andpru) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andpru/status/1314266663508992017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 8, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In response to that tweet, definitions of “core principle” included:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0&quot;&gt;Basically: &lt;/span&gt;a formal account of why brains encode information and control behaviour in the way that they do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fundamental theories on the underlying mechanisms of behavior. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;[Maybe “first principles” would be better?]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set of rules by which neurons work?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's return to the problem of explanation. What are we trying to explain? Behavior, of course [&lt;i&gt;a very specific behavior&lt;/i&gt; most of the time]: X behavior in your model organism. But we also want to explain thought, memory, perception, emotion, neurological disorders, mental illnesses, etc. Seems daunting now, eh? Can the same core principles account for all these phenomena across species? I'll step out on a limb here and say &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;NO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, then snort for asking such an unfair question. Best that your research program is broken down into tiny reductionistic chunks. More manageable that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what counts as an “explanation”? We haven't answered that yet. It depends on your goal and your preferred level of analysis (à la &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Marr_(neuroscientist)#Levels_of_analysis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Marr's 3 levels of analysis, from 'Vision'&quot;&gt;three levels&lt;/a&gt; of David Marr): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;computation – algorithm – implementation&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xD9x2oI-UDU/WPWWX-BD9KI/AAAAAAAAMHg/9f0vOZq9YkEkYrIsC2o5GsTjdnv9polmwCLcB/s1600/Marr%2Band%2Bthe%2Bhummingbird%2B%2528A%2529.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xD9x2oI-UDU/WPWWX-BD9KI/AAAAAAAAMHg/9f0vOZq9YkEkYrIsC2o5GsTjdnv9polmwCLcB/s320/Marr%2Band%2Bthe%2Bhummingbird%2B%2528A%2529.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;from &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.12.041&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Neuroscience Needs Behavior: Correcting a Reductionist Bias&quot;&gt;Krakauer et al. 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, what counts as “explanation”?

 Abstract:  Background:

There now exists many alternatives to direct journal access, such as podcasts, blogs, and news sites for physicians and the general public to stay up-to-date with medical literature. Currently however, there is a scarcity of literature that investigates these readership characteristics of open access medical news sites and how they may have shifted with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).

Objective:

The current study aimed to employ readership and survey data to characterize open access medical news readership trends in relation to COVID-19 in addition to overall readership trends regarding pandemic related information delivery.

Methods:

Anonymous aggregate readership data was obtained from 2 Minute Medicine® (www.2minutemedicine.com), an open-access, physician-run medical news organization that has published over 8000 original physician-written text and visual summaries of new medical research since 2013. In this retrospective observational study, the average article views, actions (defined as the sum of views, shares, and outbound link clicks), read times, and bounce rate (probability to leave a page in &amp;lt;30s) were compared between COVID-19 articles published between January 1 to May 31, 2020 (N = 40) to non-COVID-19 articles (N = 145) published in the same time period. A voluntary survey was also sent to subscribed 2 Minute Medicine readers to further characterize readership demographics and preferences scored by Likert Scale.

Results:

COVID-19 articles had significantly more median views than non-COVID-19 articles (296 vs. 110, U = 748.5, P &amp;lt; 0.001). There were no differences in average read times or bounce rate. Non-COVID-19 had more median actions than COVID-19 articles (2.9 vs. 2.5, U = 2070.5, P &amp;lt; 0.05). On a Likert scale of 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), survey data revealed that 66% (78/119) of readers Agreed or Strongly Agreed that they preferred staying up to date with emerging literature surrounding COVID-19 using sources such as 2 Minute Medicine versus direct journal access. A greater proportion of survey takers also indicated open access news sources to be one of their primary means of staying informed (71.7%) than direct journal article access (50.8%). A lesser proportion of readers indicated reading one or less full length medical study following introduction to 2 Minute Medicine compared to prior (16.9% vs. 31.8%, P &amp;lt; 0.05).

Conclusions:

There is a significantly increased readership in one open-access medical literature platform during the pandemic, reinforcing that open-access physician-written sources of medical news represent an important alternative to direct journal access for readers to stay up to date with medical literature.</content>

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever walked past a baker’s shop and immediately felt hungry thanks to the lovely aroma from freshly baked bread?  Smell plays an integral part in how we taste our food; if it smells good, then chances are, it’s going to taste good too. Here, Lasekan et al. looked into how the aroma of the popular bagel changed due to differences in cold fermentation time.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12348&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/bagel-1434064-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dough A (control) was allowed to develop for an hour before cooking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dough B was also allowed to develop for an hour initially but was then kneaded and placed in a chiller for 48 hours before cooking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dough C was treated similarly to Dough B, but the chilling time was reduced to 24 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key aroma-active compounds were collected via solvent assisted flavor evaporation and then characterized by a process called aroma extract dilution analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed all bagels had similar roasty, malty, buttery, baked potato-like, smoky and biscuit-like notes. However, the odor notes in the long, cold fermented bagels were more intense than those produced by the control bagels.  These findings provide a basis for more research into the effect of cold fermentation on bakery products in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-021-02618-y?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;BMC Pediatrics: Vaccinated mother gives birth to baby with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well established that newborn babies can be protected from a number of potentially fatal viruses, such as tetanus or diphtheria, though the vaccination of their mother during pregnancy; the antibodies are passed from mother to fetus though the placenta.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12349&quot; height=&quot;199&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/vaccine-6165772_1920-300x199.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With vaccine rollouts now underway in many countries, it would be hoped that a similar protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) would occur for babies born to mothers vaccinated against the virus responsible for the disease (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has indeed been shown to be the case, as demonstrated by an exciting new case study presented by pediatricians at Florida Atlantic University. The baby, a healthy baby girl, is the first infant known to have been born to a vaccinated mother with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies detected in her cord blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-021-06272-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;BMC Health Services Research:  The influence of politics on healthcare systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an age where our healthcare systems are under intense pressure, it is important to look at the services offered and implement change when needed.  Clarke and colleagues from the University of Birmingham recently performed a systematic review in order to discover how the use of “political skill” can contribute to changes in health services from both within and across organizations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12350&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/politics-2361943_1920-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review involved the analysis of 62 papers published over the last 40 years and from diverse areas of research.   The findings pointed towards political skill certainly having an impact, with changes implemented via five “thematic dimensions” which include performance, awareness, influence, stakeholder engagement and influence on policy processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-021-00536-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;BMC Psychology: Does walking through a doorway always make you forget?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands up everyone who has walked into a room and then forgotten why you were there. Interestingly, this is a well-documented phenomenon called the &lt;strong&gt;doorway effect&lt;/strong&gt;, which literally refers to how memory can be affected by passing through a doorway or other boundary.  Research into this effect has demonstrated that people can forget items of recent significance when they pass through a physical boundary (such as walking from one room to another), imagining that they have done so (i.e. metaphysical boundary) or even when moving from one desktop window to another on a computer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-12351&quot; height=&quot;196&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/idea-3338440_1920-300x196.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study recently published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, a team of researchers from the Queensland Brain Institute (University of Queensland) attempted to replicate the doorway effect with the use of both virtual and physical environments. The team ran four experiments that measured participants hot and false alarm rates to memory probes for items placed in either the same or previous room. Two experiments used highly immersive virtual reality, one used passive video watching and experiment 4 involved physically moving from one room to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of these experiments showed that there was, in fact, no significant effect of doorways on a person’s memory. These findings cast doubts on how common the doorway effect actually is and also on the finding of previous studies looking into the phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to recognize the significant growth and advancement of robotic surgery over the past few decades, &lt;em&gt;BMC Surgery&lt;/em&gt; is welcoming original submissions on &lt;strong&gt;robotic surgery&lt;/strong&gt;. The collection will be edited by an international team of Guest Editors. The collection is open for submissions until 1st April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2021-04-21T10:37:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Volker Steuber will talk about a paper &quot;Bursting Neurons Signal Input Slope&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brief bursts of high-frequency action potentials represent a common
firing mode of pyramidal neurons, and there are indications that they
represent a special neural code. It is therefore of interest to
determine whether there are particular spatial and temporal features
of neuronal inputs that trigger bursts. Recent work on pyramidal cells
indicates that bursts can be initiated by a specific spatial
arrangement of inputs in which there is coincident proximal and distal
dendritic excitation (Larkum et al., 1999). Here we have used a
computational model of an important class of bursting neurons to
investigate whether there are special temporal features of inputs that
trigger bursts. We find that when a model pyramidal neuron receives
sinusoidally or randomly varying inputs, bursts occur preferentially
on the positive slope of the input signal. We further find that the
number of spikes per burst can signal the magnitude of the slope in a
graded manner. We show how these computations can be understood in
terms of the biophysical mechanism of burst generation. There are
several examples in the literature suggesting that bursts indeed occur
preferentially on positive slopes (Guido et al., 1992; Gabbiani et
al., 1996). Our results suggest that this selectivity could be a
simple consequence of the biophysics of burst generation. Our
observations also raise the possibility that neurons use a burst
duration code useful for rapid information transmission. This
possibility could be further examined experimentally by looking for
correlations between burst duration and stimulus variables.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;You’ve painstakingly mapped out your research goal: to answer that unanswered question. You’ve conducted your experiments, analyzed the results and written your paper. Now it’s off to a journal. And the process begins. PLOS editors have seen it all and want to help get your paper published as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What does the journal office look for, and what are the potential pitfalls? More importantly, how can you ensure that your manuscript passes journal checks and moves on to peer review quickly? Here, PLOS staff discuss a few of the most common reasons why a manuscript is rejected during the initial technical check, and how to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a bit of background, after a manuscript is submitted to a scientific journal it undergoes a series of technical and ethical checks. Submissions that pass this initial screening go on to editorial assessment and peer review. Submissions that don’t meet requirements, or don’t provide enough information, may be returned to the authors for clarification. This can extend review times and even lead to a manuscript being rejected without review. Below are 5 checks and tips on how to smoothly get past them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check #1: Sense check&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quite simply, does the manuscript make sense as a submission? Is it a scientific article? Are all the typical parts of an article (abstract, introduction, methods, results/discussion, figures citations) all present? Is the language clear and understandable?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to pass it: &lt;/strong&gt;Make sure that your manuscript is complete, and that the writing is clear and unambiguous. Note that it doesn’t have to be perfect at this stage, just precise enough for fellow researchers in your field to understand and evaluate your work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resource/how-to-edit-your-work/&quot;&gt;Read PLOS’ guide to editing your work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check #2: Journal fit and scope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


      &lt;div class=&quot; block-image-text block-image-text--left&quot; id=&quot;block-image-text--block_606e20e8e3d0d&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__image  block-image-text__image--25&quot;&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Kendall-765x1024.jpg&quot; width=&quot;765&quot; /&gt;
                      &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__text&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Journals tend to specialize in particular subjects and types of studies. “The biggest reason we reject without review is scope.” Explains Kendall McKenzie, Managing Editor of &lt;em&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/journal-information#loc-scope&quot;&gt; “&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/journal-information#loc-scope&quot;&gt;Our scope page&lt;/a&gt; breaks down the diseases and categories of research we’re interested in, and even specifically states the kinds of things we don’t consider.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to pass it:&lt;/strong&gt; It comes down to submitting the right manuscript to the right publication. Carefully investigate the journal’s scope before submitting to ensure that your manuscript has a good chance of publication. If your particular article is on the edge of the journal’s expressed scope, or if you’re just not sure, search the journal for similar articles; if there are no comparable publications, your study is likely out of scope.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;→ &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/resource/how-to-choose-journal/&quot;&gt;Read PLOS’ guide to choosing a journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check #3: Acceptance criteria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


      &lt;div class=&quot; block-image-text block-image-text--left&quot; id=&quot;block-image-text--block_606e2137e3d0e&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__image  block-image-text__image--25&quot;&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Laura-1024x1024.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;
                      &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__text&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Laura Simmons, Managing Editor of &lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics &lt;/em&gt;agrees. “In addition to scope, our Editors in Chief and Section Editors may reject without review if a submission is lacking in biological or mechanistic insight (i.e. if it is too descriptive), or if the research doesn’t represent a significant advance in the field.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to pass it:&lt;/strong&gt; This one is all about doing your research. Different journals have different criteria for publication. Consult the journal website and consider whether your study fulfills the requirements and mission of the journal. Does the journal publish the type of research your study describes? Will your article appeal to the readers the journal serves? If not, consider a more specialized publication that focuses specifically on the type of research you are conducting, or, alternatively, a journal with a broader, more inclusive scope.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check #4: Plagiarism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


      &lt;div class=&quot; block-image-text block-image-text--left&quot; id=&quot;block-image-text--block_606e2181e3d0f&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__image  block-image-text__image--25&quot;&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; src=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/Emma.jpg&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; /&gt;
                      &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__text&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Most journals run an automated check that looks for similarities between your manuscript and previously published works. If the manuscript scores above a certain threshold, members of the journal staff will take a closer look at your manuscript to ensure that any direct quotes are framed within quotation marks and properly cited. “Overall the most common issue we see is authors reusing their own methods section, introduction, or conclusion from previous or related studies,” explains &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; Publishing Editor Emma Stillings. Authors don’t always realize that “you have to cite everyone, even yourself, to avoid any delay in the peer review process.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to pass it:&lt;/strong&gt; Any direct quotes &lt;em&gt;must &lt;/em&gt;be framed within quotation marks and properly attributed. That includes your own prior works. Try to avoid reusing text, and especially copy-pasting from your other papers. Check to make sure that any summaries or allusions are properly cited as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check #5: Complete and consistent ethical, funding, data, and other statements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the statements in the submission form are unclear, lacking detail, or otherwise incomplete, the process will pause while the journal office contacts the authors for more information. Similarly, if the statements within the manuscript are different from those in the submission system, the journal office will work with the authors to reconcile them before the manuscript can advance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to pass it:&lt;/strong&gt; Label and save the paperwork from the early part of your research process: funding information, committee approval documents, permits, permission forms, patient disclosure statements, study designs, and any other materials. You may need them to complete your submission form. When you are ready to submit, proofread carefully to ensure that everything in your manuscript is up-to-date and clear. Double check to make sure that any placeholder text has been replaced with the final version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final words of wisdom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


      &lt;div class=&quot; block-image-text block-image-text--left&quot; id=&quot;block-image-text--block_606e2261e3d10&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__image  block-image-text__image--25&quot;&gt;

                      &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;block-image-text__text&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It’s so important to familiarize yourself with a journal before submitting. What’s the scope of the journal? What article types do they publish? Are you adhering to the guidelines for that particular article type? Making sure you’re informed about what type of work the journal publishes and how, can go a long way in deciding where to submit and speeding your manuscript through the initial submission stages.” &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:eclancy@plos.org&quot;&gt;Eileen Clancy&lt;/a&gt;, Managing Editor of &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2021-04-16T18:52:49+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;Early convolutional neural net (CNNs) architectures like the Neocognitron, LeNet and HMAX were inspired by the brain. But how much like the brain are modern CNNs? I made a pretty strong claim on Twitter a few weeks ago that the early visual processing is nothing like a CNN:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot; data-carousel-extra=&quot;{&amp;quot;blog_id&amp;quot;:3084329,&amp;quot;permalink&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/xcorr.net\/2021\/04\/16\/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net\/&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;CNNs are better models of vision than transformers. But you know what's funny? Early vision is nothing like a CNN. There are no mechanisms to tie weights from one neuron to another. Resolution varies with eccentricity. Features maps vary across space. So why do they look similar? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/RMLRHJTS4U&quot;&gt;https://t.co/RMLRHJTS4U&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Patrick Mineault (@patrickmineault) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/patrickmineault/status/1377685962067746820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In typical Twitter fashion, my statement was a little over-the-top, and it deserved a takedown. What followed was a long thread of replies from Blake Richards, Grace Lindsay, Dileep George, Simon Kornblith, members of Jim DiCarlo’s lab, and even Yann LeCun. The different perspectives are interesting, and I’m curating them here. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My position, in brief, is that weight sharing and feature maps – the defining characteristics of modern CNNs – are crude approximations of the topography of the early visual cortex and its localized connection structure. Whether this distinction matters in practice depends on what you want your models to accomplish – I argue that for naturalistic vision, it can matter a lot. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are several defining characteristics of modern CNNs:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hierarchical processing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Selectivity operations (i.e the ReLU)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pooling operations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Localized receptive fields&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feature maps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight sharing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where did these ideas come from?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hubel and Wiesel (1962) described simple and complex cells in the cat primary visual cortex. Simple cells respond best to a correctly oriented bar or edge. Complex cells, on the other hand, are not sensitive to the sign of the contrast of the bar or edge, or its exact location. They hypothesized that simple cells are generated by aggregating the correct LGN afferents selective for light and dark spots, followed by the threshold nonlinearity of the cells. Complex cells were hypothesized to be generated by pooling from similarly tuned simple cells. They later expanded these ideas: perhaps first-order and second-order hypercomplex cells are created by the repetition of the same pattern. Thus, hierarchy, selectivity, pooling and localized receptive fields were all hypothesized to be taking place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot; data-carousel-extra=&quot;{&amp;quot;blog_id&amp;quot;:3084329,&amp;quot;permalink&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/xcorr.net\/2021\/04\/16\/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net\/&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Adapted from (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962). | Download Scientific Diagram&quot; height=&quot;363&quot; src=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tomaso-Poggio-2/publication/265923351/figure/fig2/AS:669389284200460@1536606250398/Adapted-from-Hubel-and-Wiesel-1962.ppm&quot; width=&quot;466&quot; /&gt;Annotated figures from Hubel &amp;amp; Wiesel (1962)&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fukushima (1980) adapted many of these ideas in a self-organized hierarchical neural network called the Neocognitron. In the S-layers, neurons weight the input from previous layers via localized receptive fields, followed by a ReLU nonlinearity. In C-layers, inputs from the previous are pooled linearly, followed by a sigmoid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Neocognitron also introduces what may be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; defining features of modern CNNs: parallel feature maps (here called planes) and weight sharing. This is most clearly seen in the selectivity operation for S-layers, which is a convolution over the set of local coordinates &lt;img alt=&quot;S_l&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_l&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; /&gt;, followed by a ReLU:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason behind the introduction of parallel feature maps and weight sharing is not very clear in the original paper, and in fact in section 3 the paper casts doubt on how realistic these assumptions are as a model of vision:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the basic hypotheses employed in the neocognitron is the assumption that all the S-cells in the same S-plane have input synapses of the same spatial distribution, and that only the positions of the presynaptic cells shift in parallel in accordance with the shift in position of individual S-cell’s receptive fields. It is not known whether modifiable synapses in the real nervous system are actually self-organized always keeping such conditions. Even if it is assumed to be true, neither do we know by what mechanism such a self-organization goes on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So why introduce these features at all?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Topography conquers all&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fukushima however links localized receptive fields with the idea of localized topography:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;[…] orderly synaptic connections are formed between retina and optic tectum not only in the development in the embryo but also in regeneration in the adult amphibian or fish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is one of the enduring facts of visual neuroscience: inputs from the retina are preserved topologically as they make their way to the LGN, V1, and onwards to extrastriate cortex. Visual angle and log radius are mapped from the retina to V1 in development, guided by chemical gradients. The progression of the maps reverse as we go up the visual hierarchy (in fact, areas are defined by this very reversal in direction). What’s remarkable is how precise the topography is: Hubel and Wiesel estimated that in primary visual cortex, neighbouring cells varied in receptive field center by less than half a receptive field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot; data-carousel-extra=&quot;{&amp;quot;blog_id&amp;quot;:3084329,&amp;quot;permalink&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/xcorr.net\/2021\/04\/16\/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net\/&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;FIG. 1.&quot; height=&quot;-587&quot; src=&quot;https://journals.physiology.org/cms/10.1152/jn.01202.2003/asset/images/large/z9k0070439721001.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;-305&quot; /&gt;From Ringach (2004)&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s another fact of life in cortex, which is that horizontal wiring is expensive. If a neuron integrates from localized inputs, and those inputs are retinotopically organized, that neuron will have a localized receptive field. If you assume that the synaptic pattern is localized and random then for every cell, there must be other similarly tuned cells somewhere else in the visual field. My postdoc advisor Dario &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.01202.2003&quot;&gt;Ringach introduced a model (2004)&lt;/a&gt; for how simple cells in primary visual cortex can occur from such sparse localized connections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That covers feature maps. However, if the input statistics to primary visual cortex are stationary, then a self-supervised criterion could refine a randomly initialized V1 feature map, effectively letting the input do the weight tying – a subtle point brought up by Blake Richards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Non-stationarities at the large scale&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I hope to have convinced you that the link between CNNs, first introduced by Fukushima, and early visual processing in the brain is quite subtle. Whether a CNN is a good or a bad model of early visual processing depends on what phenomenon we care to model. If we’re talking about core visual recognition in the parafovea – which is what the majority of the quantification comes from – the match is quite good. At larger spatial scales, however, I would argue that the match is compromised by two facts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, spatial resolution is not constant as a function of space. A CNN on a Cartesian grid doesn’t scale with eccentricity. This issue has received some attention lately, and foveating CNNs are starting to be considered – see &lt;a href=&quot;https://openreview.net/forum?id=2_Z6MECjPEa&quot;&gt;this recent paper from Arturo Deza and Talia Konkle for example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot; data-carousel-extra=&quot;{&amp;quot;blog_id&amp;quot;:3084329,&amp;quot;permalink&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/xcorr.net\/2021\/04\/16\/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net\/&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/26196&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;211&quot; src=&quot;https://iiif.elifesciences.org/lax/26196%2Felife-26196-fig9-v1.tif/full/1500,/0/default.jpg&quot; width=&quot;459&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spatial frequency tuning correlates with spatial tuning. From Arcaro and Livingstone (2017)&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the eyes foveate towards interesting targets – e.g. faces – which mean that statistics are highly nonstationary different as a function of space. The ground looks very different from the sky. Hands tend to be in the lower half of the visual field, and numerous visual areas have only partial maps of the visual field. There’s overrepresentation of radial orientations, more curvature selectivity in the fovea, no blue cones in the fovea, etc. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s a picture to illustrate this. If VGG19 is a good model of primary visual visual cortex, then it follows that maximizing predicted activity in primary visual cortex could be done by maximizing an unweighted sum of VGG19 subunits, a la DeepDream. If you do that for layer 7 of VGG19, you get the picture on the left. However, we can use fMRI to estimate a matrix, via ridge regression that maps VGG19 to an fMRI subspace, and then optimize a weighted sum of VGG19 subunits, giving us the picture on the right. This image highlights some of the known spatial biases in primary visual cortex – shifts in prefered spatial frequency as a function of eccentricity, radial bias, curvature bias in the fovea – which are not apparent in an unweighted VGG19. So at the very least, the brain’s image manifold is rotated and rescaled compared to the VGG19 image manifold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Margaret Livingstone has a very interesting line of research (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl_YTcec9Z0&quot;&gt;talk here&lt;/a&gt;) highlighting the close link between spatial biases and the development of object and face recognition modules in high-level visual cortex. More generally, if we’re interested in how vision is organized for action – ecological vision in the tradition of Gibson – then whether a network has captured, e.g. the fact that the bottom half of the visual field has very different affordances than the top half matters. If you applied a unsupervised criterion to learn features from natural images without weight sharing, those features would vary quite a bit across space – unlike in a CNN. This point was also raised by Dileep George.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Weight sharing is not strictly necessary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LeCun (1989) demonstrates the use of backpropagation to train a convolutional image recognition network. There’s a beautiful figure that highlights the effect of adding more and more constraints, in particular in going from a fully-connected 2-layer network (net2) to a high-capacity convolutional neural net (net5):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot; data-carousel-extra=&quot;{&amp;quot;blog_id&amp;quot;:3084329,&amp;quot;permalink&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/xcorr.net\/2021\/04\/16\/is-early-vision-like-a-convolutional-neural-net\/&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7584&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7584&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1496,1026&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/image-8/&quot; height=&quot;326&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=1024&quot; width=&quot;476&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;From LeCun (1989)&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LeCun (1989) clarifies that weight sharing is a clever trick that decreases the number of weights to be learned, which in the small data limit is practically important to obtain good test set accuracy. We are a long ways from 1989 in terms of dataset size, and unsupervised learning could learn untied feature maps, as pointed out by Yann LeCun in the Twitter thread. But would currently existing benchmarks favor ANNs-with-local-receptive-field-but-untied-weights?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;The leaderboard is the message&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s turn back to the claim that early visual cortex is like a particular CNN. As Wu, David and Gallant (2006) put it:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;an important long-term goal of sensory neuroscience [is] developing models of sensory systems that accurately predict neuronal responses under completely natural conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brain-score.org/&quot;&gt;Brain-Score&lt;/a&gt; is an embodiment of this idea – benchmark, across many different datasets and ventral stream areas, the ability of many different CNNs to explain brain activity. The leaderboard is pretty clear that the VGG19 architecture outperform alternatives in explaining average firing rate – even when these alternatives are better at classifying images in ImageNet. That’s an interesting finding – VGG19 is shallower and has larger receptive fields than more modern CNNs, so perhaps its performance on this benchmark is because of that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Grace Lindsay pointed out that:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;[…] when the results were first coming out that trained convolutional neural networks are good predictors of activity in the visual system some people had the attitude of “that’s not interesting because obviously anything that does vision well will look like the brain”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting is that we now have architectures that solve object recognition which are very different from CNNs, namely visual transformers (ViT). They are architecturally different from brains, and they while they perform well on ImageNet, they underperform in predicting single neuron responses. So now we have a clear example of a disconnect between ImageNet performance and similarity to the brain, and that strengthens the claim that core object recognition is like a CNN.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So on the one hand, the data from BrainScore says that CNNs are the best models of core object recognition, yet there are pretty stark ways in which early visual processing is unlike a CNN, some of which I’ve mentioned already, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07092&quot;&gt;others which have been highlighted in Grace Lindsay’s excellent review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Would Brain-Score, in theory, rate better a model which respects the distinction between excitation and inhibition (Dale’s law)? That seems unlikely, since there are no cell type annotations in the datasets. Would it rate better a foveated model, or one that doesn’t have weight sharing? Again, unlikely, since as Tiago Marques points out, for technical reasons, most datasets are taken in the parafovea. In any case, the metric used to score the models is rotation invariant, so it wouldn’t be able to tell these cases apart. As Simon Kornblith points out, choices of metrics are not falsifiable. The right approach for choosing metrics is the axiomatic one, as demonstrated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00414&quot;&gt;Simon’s CKA paper&lt;/a&gt;: the modeller or the community decides what the right metric is based off of design criterias that represent what they think is interesting about the data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Does that mean we should ignore Brain-Score? No! I really like Brain-Score – I wish there were many more Brain-Score-like leaderboards! Comparing on lots of datasets prevents cherry picking – there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2017/02/16/an-introduction-to-meta-analysis/&quot;&gt;robustness in the meta-analytic approach&lt;/a&gt;. What I’m excited about is the possibility of Brain-Scores – a constellation of leaderboards that benchmark different models according to rules which match on modeler’s interests. I’ve been involved in proto-community-benchmark efforts like the neural prediction challenge and spikefinder before, and the technological barriers to run such a leaderboard have been lowered by commoditized cloud infra. The value proposition is also becoming clearer, and I am excited to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurallatents.github.io/&quot;&gt;more of these efforts pop up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In brief:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Convolutional neural nets assume shared weights&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This assumption is not valid at large spatial scales&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Large spatial scales matter if you care about naturalistic foveated vision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s a useful assumption in the low-data regime, which we’re not in&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The current benchmarks are not sensitive to this issue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s possible and desirable to create new benchmarks which are sensitive to this, and I hope to do that in the future!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

Until now, no studies have examined the contribution of developing countries to authors, editors or research in high-ranking neurology journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for research in neurology cannot be understated. Globally, neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability, yet &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(19)30411-9&quot;&gt;low and middle-income countries bear almost 80% of the burden of neurological disorders&lt;/a&gt;. As the population continues to grow, the degree of burden will continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorship and editorial board representation from developing countries in neurology journals is exceedingly rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess representation in neurology journals, we conducted a cross-sectional study of all research articles published in 2010 and 2019 in the five highest ranked peer-reviewed neurology journals: &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Neurology, Acta Neuropathologica, Nature Reviews Neurology, Brain&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Annals of Neurology&lt;/em&gt;. Using this data, we determined the extent of contributions of authors, editors, and research from developing countries, as well as the degree of international research collaboration between developed and developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that authorship and editorial board representation from developing countries in neurology journals is exceedingly rare, and this has not changed in the past decade. First authorship was attributed to authors from developing countries in only 2% of research articles in 2010 and 3% in 2019. The lack of representation in research extends to the editorial boards of the selected journals, none of which had a board member from a developing country. Unsurprisingly, the primary data of these publications originated largely from developed countries with advanced research facilities, namely the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;National and international research bodies are well placed to reduce this disparity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tackling underrepresentation in research is no simple feat. Nevertheless, our results highlight that there is an urgent need for strategies to support high-quality locally-driven biomedical research in developing countries. Local researchers in developing countries benefit from exposure to greater research opportunities, education, and training. This is beneficial to developing countries as they are able to direct socially and culturally relevant research that is readily applicable to local healthcare systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National and international research bodies are well placed to reduce this disparity through greater representation via international collaborations which strengthen the quality of research in developing countries. By fostering high-quality and culturally relevant research, local healthcare systems are able to readily apply these findings to meet the neurological needs of their population.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This morning a professor at a US university warned me that they had gotten an email from a person pretending to be me. The email came from &lt;strong&gt;elisabeth_bik@yeah.net&lt;/strong&gt;, and was signed with my name. But that is not my email address! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The email sent to the professor flagged a scientific paper as “The following article is fake. The impact on society is very bad”. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should feel flattered, but it is quite disturbing that people pretend to be me. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So here is a quick warning that there are Elisabeth Bik impersonators using fake email addresses. My correct email address is eliesbik at gmail dot com and if an email comes from any other address that is not me! &lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about a paper &quot;Organization of Cell Assemblies in the Hippocampus&quot; and will briefly
presnt how this subject can be approached with topological data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurons can produce action potentials with high temporal precision. A
fundamental issue is whether, and how, this capability is used in
information processing. According to the &quot;cell assembly&quot; hypothesis,
transient synchrony of anatomically distributed groups of neurons
underlies processing of both external sensory input and internal
cognitive mechanisms. Accordingly, neuron populations should be
arranged into groups whose synchrony exceeds that predicted by common
modulation by sensory input. Here we find that the spike times of
hippocampal pyramidal cells can be predicted more accurately by using
the spike times of simultaneously recorded neurons in addition to the
animals location in space. This improvement remained when the spatial
prediction was refined with a spatially dependent theta phase
modulation. The time window in which spike times are best predicted
from simultaneous peer activity is 10-30,ms, suggesting
that cell assemblies are synchronized at this timescale. Because this
temporal window matches the membrane time constant of pyramidal
neurons, the period of the hippocampal gamma oscillation and the time
window for synaptic plasticity, we propose that cooperative activity
at this timescale is optimal for information transmission and storage
in cortical circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line-block&quot;&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/measles-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite widespread coverage with a highly efficacious vaccine, pockets of under vaccinated populations and imported cases can result in sizable measles outbreaks. And even though measles was declared &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/measles/elimination.html&quot;&gt;eliminated in the United States&lt;/a&gt; more than 20 years ago, the country has faced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html&quot;&gt;series of large measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in the years since, particularly over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-10652-9&quot;&gt;our study&lt;/a&gt; just published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, we conducted interviews with individuals from state and local health departments and health systems from across the country who responded to measles outbreaks in 2017-19, representing outbreaks that account for more than 75% of all US measles cases over that period. Our principal aim was to capture firsthand operational experiences in order to generate evidence-based lessons that can inform preparedness activities for future outbreaks of measles and other highly transmissible diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study took place under the umbrella of a larger initiative, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outbreakobservatory.org/about-1/#mission&quot;&gt;Outbreak Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, which seeks to address the operational challenges and barriers faced during outbreak responses and disseminate lessons to facilitate future preparedness and response efforts. Outbreak responses tend to be busy times that do not lend themselves to documenting operational knowledge acquired during the response. Outbreak Observatory aims to provide a forum to aggregate those lessons so that other jurisdictions can put them into practice without having to learn them firsthand. Previous Outbreak Observatory studies—including on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305139&quot;&gt;2017-18 US hepatitis A epidemic&lt;/a&gt; and the impact of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/infection-control-and-hospital-epidemiology/article/preparedness-and-response-to-an-emerging-health-threatlessons-learned-from-candida-auris-outbreaks-in-the-united-states/8A4AD3D3F0C26821C652723765985BFB&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida auris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wmpllc.org/ojs/index.php/jem/article/view/2753&quot;&gt;2017-18 influenza season&lt;/a&gt; on US health systems—identified lessons that reach beyond those individual responses to inform broader outbreak and epidemic preparedness. As highlighted by the complexities of the COVID-19 pandemic response, it is critical to share the wealth of operational experience held by frontline responders to improve outbreak response readiness and capacity in advance of future communicable disease events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for the smaller outbreaks, health departments faced considerable challenges conducting routine outbreak response activities, such as contact tracing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants in our study on US measles outbreaks called attention to a number of resource and operational gaps during their response operations that apply directly to the COVID-19 pandemic. While some of these outbreaks were quite large, none even remotely compared to the scale of the US COVID-19 epidemic. Even for the smaller outbreaks, health departments faced considerable challenges conducting routine outbreak response activities, such as contact tracing. These gaps became front-page news with COVID-19, as health departments around the country struggled to implement effective &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/health/coronavirus-testing-labs-workers.html&quot;&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03518-4&quot;&gt;contact tracing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02478-z&quot;&gt;other surveillance operations&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic. Additionally, most health departments interviewed in this study indicated that they did not have the resources available to conduct &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2021/03/02/biden-promises-enough-covid-19-vaccines-all-americans-end-of-may/&quot;&gt;mass vaccination operations&lt;/a&gt; in response to the outbreak. Rather, they relied heavily on healthcare providers and pharmacists in the community to administer the vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health preparedness funding has decreased steadily over the past decade or longer, and health departments are unable to maintain the programs and personnel required to respond to even minor outbreaks, let alone major epidemics or pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have observed during the COVID-19 response—first with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/03/etruenorth-tiny-company-running-covid-19-company/&quot;&gt;mass testing clinics&lt;/a&gt; and currently with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2102535&quot;&gt;vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;—health departments need considerable external resources to stand up large-scale responses for major epidemics. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tfah.org/report-details/publichealthfunding2020/&quot;&gt;Public health preparedness funding has decreased steadily&lt;/a&gt; over the past decade or longer, and health departments are unable to maintain the programs and personnel required to respond to even minor outbreaks, let alone major epidemics or pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the outbreaks included in this study, many of which occurred largely in insular communities—eg, racial/ethnic minorities, immigrants, orthodox religious communities—COVID-19 has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html&quot;&gt;disproportionately impacted vulnerable racial and ethnic minority communities&lt;/a&gt;. Public health and healthcare organizations faced significant barriers to encouraging vaccination among the affected communities, and we are currently observing similar challenges as the availability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines scales up and eligibility groups expand. During the measles outbreaks, health officials often relied on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tmj4.com/news/coronavirus/most-trusted-voices-are-local-doctors-clergy-wh-press-secretary-psaki-talks-vaccine-hesitancy-and-access-in-tmj4-exclusive&quot;&gt;community healthcare providers&lt;/a&gt;, particularly those that serve vulnerable and insular communities, to engage with the affected community. Additionally, trusted community leaders—including religious leaders, business owners, and community-based organizations—played a critical role as trusted voices to disseminate accurate information regarding protective measures, including vaccination. It requires substantial time and resources to develop these relationships, however, and it can be very difficult to do so in the midst of an outbreak or epidemic response. Health departments that had previously established relationships (e.g., from previous outbreaks) found it easier to leverage these community leaders to make a positive impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, most outbreak research focuses on the disease epidemiology or clinical care or is limited to after-action reports that focus on organizational challenges and may never be published publicly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, most outbreak research focuses on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clinicalkey.com/#!/content/playContent/1-s2.0-S1201971218345466&quot;&gt;disease epidemiology or clinical care&lt;/a&gt; or is limited to after-action reports that focus on organizational challenges and may never be published publicly. It is critical to understand the operational experiences of frontline responders, including public health and healthcare organizations, and to translate those experiences into evidence-based lessons that can inform other preparedness efforts. Without these lessons, the jurisdictions repeat the same mistakes and must learn those lessons firsthand. And the challenges, barriers, and shortcomings identified during smaller outbreaks will only be exacerbated during larger events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to document and disseminate these operational experiences, like Outbreak Observatory and others, support the development of programs and policies that can enable sustainable public health preparedness capacity that is needed for a range of communicable disease events, from smaller outbreaks to larger health emergencies like COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If you haven’t heard about Clubhouse yet… well, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolis/2021/01/26/the-latest-silicon-valley-unicorn-clubhouse-raises-100-million-and-also-raises-attention-to-the-importance-of-audio-based-social-networking/?sh=581771e823a6&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the latest Silicon Valley unicorn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; popular new chat hole for thought leaders. I heard about it for the first time a few months ago, and was kindly offered an invitation (Club house is invitation only!) so I could explore what it is all about. Clubhouse is an app for audio based social networking, and the content is, as far as I can tell, a mixed bag. I’ve listened to a handful of conversations hosted on the app.. topics include everything from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/everyone-wants-invite-clubhouse-crypto&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/01/26/forget-about-san-francisco-and-silicon-valley-miami-is-planning-on-being-the-next-great-tech-hub/?sh=7aceb2ea466e&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;. It was interesting, at times, to hear the thoughts and opinions of some of the discussants. On the other hand, there is a lot of superficial rambling on Clubhouse as well. During a conversation about genetics I heard someone posit that biology has a lot to learn from the fashion industry. This was delivered in a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZBKX-6Gz6A&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;you are hearing something profound&lt;/a&gt;” manner, by someone who clearly knew nothing about either biology or the fashion industry, which is really too bad, because the fashion industry is quite interesting and I wouldn’t be surprised at all if biology has something to learn from it. Unfortunately, I never learned what that is. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the regulars on Clubhouse is &lt;a href=&quot;https://noorsiddiqui.com/about/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Noor Siddiqui&lt;/a&gt;. You may not have heard of her; in fact she is officially “not notable”. That is to say, she used to have a Wikipedia page but it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Noor_Siddiqui&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deleted on the grounds that there is nothing about her that indicates notability&lt;/a&gt;, which is of course notable in and of itself… a paradox that says more about Wikipedia’s gatekeeping than Siddiqui (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Mathematics&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Russell 1903&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/littmath/status/1380003729445896194?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Litt 2021&lt;/a&gt;). In any case, Siddiqui was recently part of a Clubhouse conversation on “&lt;a href=&quot;https://ios.joinclubhouse.com/event/PD4qybXo&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;convergence of genomics and reproductive technology&lt;/a&gt;” together with Carlos Bustamante (advisor to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medcitynews.com/2017/12/luna-dna-will-give-bitcoins-genomic-data/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cryptocurrency based Luna DNA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cdbustamante/status/1380991720431742978?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;soon to be professor of business technology&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Miami) and Balaji Srinivasan (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tim.blog/2021/03/24/balaji-srinivasan/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bitcoin angel investor and entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt;). As it happens, Siddiqui is the CEO of a startup called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orchidhealth.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Orchid Health&lt;/a&gt;“, in the genomics and reproductive technology “space”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/orchid-launches-reports-to-help-couples-have-healthy-babies-by-quantifying-genetic-risk-301261496.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The company promises&lt;/a&gt; to harness “population genetics, statistical modeling, reproductive technologies, and the latest advances in genomic science” to “give parents the option to lower a future child’s genetic risk by creating embryos through in IVF and implanting embryos in the order that can reduce disease risk.” This “product” will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://mendelspod.com/podcasts/orchid-health-first-world-offer-whole-genome-couples-report/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;available later this year&lt;/a&gt;. Bustamante and Srinivasan are early “&lt;a href=&quot;https://guides.orchidhealth.com/post/announcing-orchid&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;operators and investors&lt;/a&gt;” in the venture. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Orchid is not Siddiqui’s first startup. While she doesn’t have a Wikipedia page, she does have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://noorsiddiqui.com/about/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; where she boasts of having (briefly) been a Thiel fellow and, together with her sister, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techtimes.com/articles/14126/20140827/google-glass-has-a-place-in-the-medical-industry-with-a-new-app.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;starting a company&lt;/a&gt; as a teenager. The idea of the (briefly in existence) startup was apparently to help the now commercially defunct &lt;a href=&quot;https://screenrant.com/google-glass-smart-glasses-what-happened-explained/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Glass&lt;/a&gt; gain acceptance by bringing the device to the medical industry. According to Siddiqui, Orchid is also not her first dive into statistical modeling or genomics. She notes on her website that she did “AI and genomics research”, specifically on “deep learning for genomics”. Such training and experience could have been put to good use but…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polygenic risk scores and polygenic embryo selection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Orchid Health claims that it will “safely and naturally, protect your baby from diseases that run in your family” (the slogan “have healthy babies” is prominently displayed on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orchidhealth.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;company’s website&lt;/a&gt;). The way it will do this is to utilize “&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/news/orchid-blooms-with-4-5m-seed-for-preconception-test-to-determine-genetic-risks/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;” to screen embryos created through in-vitro fertilization (IVF) for “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orchidhealth.com/embryo&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;breast cancer, prostate cancer, heart disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;“. What this means in (a statistical geneticist’s) layman’s terms is that &lt;strong&gt;Orchid is planning to use polygenic risk scores derived from genome-wide association studies to perform polygenic embryo selection for complex diseases&lt;/strong&gt;. This can be easily unpacked because it’s quite a simple proposition, although it’s far from a trivial one- the statistical genetics involved is deep and complicated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;single-gene disorder&lt;/a&gt; is a health problem that is caused by a single mutation in the genome. Examples of such disorders include Tay-Sachs disease, sickle cell anaemia, Huntington’s disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and many other diseases. A “complex disease”, also called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multifactorial_diseases&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;multifactorial disease&lt;/a&gt;, is a disease that has a genetic component, but one that involves multiple genes, i.e. it is&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;not a single-gene disorder. Crucially, complex diseases may involve effects of environmental factors, whose role in causing disease may depend on the genetic composition of an individual. The list of diseases on Orchid’s website, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, heart disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease are all examples of complex (multifactorial) diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To identify genes that &lt;em&gt;associate &lt;/em&gt;with a complex disease, researchers perform &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;genome-wide association studies&lt;/a&gt; (GWAS). In such studies, researchers typically analyze several million genomic sites in a large numbers of individuals with and without a disease (used to be thousands of individuals, nowadays hundreds of thousands or millions) and perform regressions to assess the marginal effect at each locus. I italicized the word associate above, because genome-wide association studies do not, in and of themselves, point to genomic loci that cause disease. Rather, they produce, as output, lists of genomic loci that have varying degrees of association with the disease or trait of interest. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygenic_score&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Polygenic risk scores&lt;/a&gt; (PRS), which &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/broadinstitute/status/1354804918264098817?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Broad Institute claims to have discovered&lt;/a&gt; (narrator: they were not discovered at the Broad Institute), are a way to combine the multiple genetic loci associated with a complex disease from a GWAS. Specifically, a PRS &lt;img alt=&quot;\hat{S}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7BS%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=545454&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; /&gt; for a complex disease is given by&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\hat{S} = \sum_{j=1}^m X_j \hat{\beta}_j,&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7BS%7D+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5Em+X_j+%5Chat%7B%5Cbeta%7D_j%2C&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=545454&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;where the sum is over &lt;img alt=&quot;m&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=545454&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; /&gt; different genetic loci, the &lt;img alt=&quot;X_j&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_j&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=545454&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; /&gt; are coded genetic markers for an individual at the &lt;img alt=&quot;m&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=545454&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; /&gt; loci, and the &lt;img alt=&quot;\hat{\beta}_j&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cbeta%7D_j&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=545454&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;c=20201002&quot; /&gt; are weights based on the marginal effects derived from a GWAS.  The concept of a PRS is straightforward, but the details are complicated, in some cases subtle, and generally non-trivial. There is debate over how many genomic loci should be used in computing a polygenic risk score given that the vast majority of marginal effects are very close to zero (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/28/R2/R143/5555564&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Janssens 2019&lt;/a&gt;), lots of ongoing research about how to set the weights to account for issues such as bias caused by&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_disequilibrium&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; linkage disequilibrium&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.09.001&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vilhjálmsson et al. 2015&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.22050&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shin et al. 2017&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.22245&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Newcombe et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09718-5&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ge et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12653-0&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lloyd-Jones et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?rev=2&amp;amp;id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008271&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pattee and Pan 2020&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?rev=2&amp;amp;id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008271&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Song et al. 2020&lt;/a&gt;), and continuing discussions about the ethics of using polygenic risk scores in the clinic (&lt;a href=&quot;https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-021-00829-7&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lewis and Green 2021&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While much of the discussion around PRS applications centers on applications such as determining diagnostic testing frequency (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-018-0418-5&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wald and Old 2019&lt;/a&gt;),  polygenic embryo selection (PES) posits that polygenic risk scores should be taken a step further and evaluated for embryos to be used as a basis for discarding, or selecting, specific embryos for in vitro fertilization implantation. The idea has been widely criticized and critiqued (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)31210-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867419312103%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Karavani et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;). It has been described as unethical, morally repugnant, and concerns about its use for eugenics have been voiced by many. Underlying these criticisms is the fact that the technical issues with PES using PRS are manifold.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor penetrance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The term “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrance&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;penetrance&lt;/a&gt;” for a disease refers to the proportion of individuals with a particular genetic variant that have the disease. Many single-gene disorders have very high penetrance. For example, F508del mutation in the CFTR gene is 100% penetrant for cystic fibrosis. That is, 100% of people who are homozygous for this variant, meaning that both copies of their DNA have a deletion of the phenylalanine amino acid in position 508 of their CFTR gene, will have cystic fibrosis. The vast majority of variants associated with complex diseases have very low penetrance. For example, in schizophrenia, the penetrance of “high risk” &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; copy number variants (in which there are variable copies of DNA at a genomic loci) was found to be between 2% and 7.4% (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/19/17/3477/677022&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vassos et al 2010&lt;/a&gt;). The low penetrance at large numbers of variants for complex diseases was precisely the rationale for developing polygenic risk scores in the first place, the idea being that while individual variants yield small effects, perhaps in (linear) combination they can have more predictive power. While it is true that combining variants does yield more predictive power for complex diseases, unfortunately the accuracy is, in absolute terms, very low. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reason for low predictive power of PRS is explained well in (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-018-0418-5&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wald and Old 2020&lt;/a&gt;) and is illustrated for coronary artery disease (CAD) in (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S073510972035155X?via%3Dihub&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rotter and Lin 2020&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/rotterandlin.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14722&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;14722&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;rotterandlin&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/rotterandlin.png?w=490&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/rotterandlin.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/rotterandlin.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1698,1302&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2021/04/12/the-amoral-nonsense-of-orchids-embryo-selection/rotterandlin/&quot; height=&quot;458&quot; src=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/rotterandlin.png?w=1024&quot; width=&quot;599&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issue is that while the polygenic risk score distribution may indeed be shifted for individuals with a disease, and while this shift may be statistically significant resulting in large odds ratios, i.e. much higher &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; risk for individuals with higher PRS, the proportion of individuals in the tail of the distributions who will or won’t develop the disease will greatly affect the predictive power of the PRS. For example, Wald and Old note that PRS for CAD from (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0183-z&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Khera et al. 2018&lt;/a&gt;) will confer a detection rate of only 15% with a false positive rate of 5%. At a 3% false positive rate the detection rate would be only 10%. This is visible in the figure above, where it is clear that control of the false positive right (i.e. thresholding at the extreme right-hand side with high PRS score) will filter out many (most) affected individuals. The same issue is raised in the excellent review on PES of (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-020-01019-3&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lázaro-Muńoz et al. 2020&lt;/a&gt;). The authors explain that “even if a PRS in the top decile for schizophrenia conferred a nearly fivefold increased risk for a given embryo, this would still yield a &amp;gt;95% chance of not developing the disorder.” It is worth noting in this context, that diseases like schizophrenia are not even well defined phenotypically (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178120305047?casa_token=gKO_3q8Fr5gAAAAA:cvtDCj7tY2Pj6ZFcpLS3KgGN0MnnNlxcgU5rsL0P-DhIOdYQD6wIU2GBAWFuT6Ou51njyLqs_A&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mølstrøm et al. 2020&lt;/a&gt;), which is another complex matter that is too involved to go into detail here.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a recent tweet, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/noor_siddiqui_/status/1357768845818232834&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Siddiqui describes natural conception as a genetic lottery&lt;/a&gt;, and suggests that Orchid Health, by performing PES, can tilt the odds in customers’ favor. To do so the false positive rate must be low, or else too many embryos will be discarded. But a 15% sensitivity is highly problematic considering the risks inherent with IVF in the first place (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g252&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kamphuis et al. 2014&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14698&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;14698&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;image&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=490&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1098,734&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/image-3/&quot; height=&quot;349&quot; src=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/image.png?w=1024&quot; width=&quot;522&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be concrete, an odds ratio of 2.8 for cerebral palsy needs to be balanced against the fact that in the Khera et al. study, only 8% of individuals had an odds ratio &amp;gt;3.0 for CAD. Other diseases are even worse, in this sense, than CAD. In atrial fibrillation (one of the diseases on Orchid Health’s list), only 9.3% of the individuals in the top 0.44% of the atrial fibrillation PRS actually had atrial fibrillation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315686&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Choi et al 2019&lt;/a&gt;).As one starts to think carefully about the practical aspects and tradeoffs in performing PES, other issues, resulting from the low penetrance of complex disease variants, come into play as well. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.05.370478v2.full&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lencz et al. 2020&lt;/a&gt;) examine these tradeoffs in detail, and conclude that “the differential performance of PES across selection strategies and risk reduction metrics may be difficult to communicate to couples seeking assisted reproductive technologies… These difficulties are expected to exacerbate the already profound ethical issues raised by PES… which include stigmatization, autonomy (including “choice overload”, and equity. In addition, the ever-present specter of eugenics may be especially salient in the context of the LRP (lowest-risk prioritization) strategy.” They go on to “call for urgent deliberations amongst key stakeholders (including researchers, clinicians, and patients) to address governance of PES and for the development of policy statements by professional societies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pleiotropy&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;predicaments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I remember a conversation I had with &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9F2LPg4AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nicolas Bray&lt;/a&gt; several years ago shortly after the exciting discovery of CRISPR/Cas9 for genome editing, on the implications of the technology for improving human health. Nick pointed out that the development of genomics had been curiously “backwards”. Thirty years ago, when human genome sequencing was beginning in earnest, the hope was that with the sequence at hand we would be able to start figuring out the function of genes, and even individual base pairs in the genome. At the time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.mit.edu/1992/genome-1209&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the human genome project was billed as&lt;/a&gt; being able to “help scientists search for genes associated with human disease” and it was imagined that “greater understanding of the genetic errors that cause disease should pave the way for new strategies in diagnosis, therapy, and disease prevention.” Instead, what happened is that genome editing technology has arrived well before we have any idea of what the vast majority of the genome does, let alone the implications of edits to it. Similarly, while the coupling of IVF and genome sequencing makes it possible to select embryos based on genetic variants today, the reality is that we have no idea how the genome functions, or what the vast majority of genes or variants actually do.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/1_5fr1lgixepynapdocu98ca.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14725&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;14725&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;1_5Fr1LgIxEpYNApdOCu98cA&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/1_5fr1lgixepynapdocu98ca.jpeg?w=490&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/1_5fr1lgixepynapdocu98ca.jpeg?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/1_5fr1lgixepynapdocu98ca.jpeg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;500,224&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2021/04/12/the-amoral-nonsense-of-orchids-embryo-selection/1_5fr1lgixepynapdocu98ca/&quot; height=&quot;194&quot; src=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/1_5fr1lgixepynapdocu98ca.jpeg?w=500&quot; width=&quot;434&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One thing that is known about the genome is that it is chock full of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pleiotropy&lt;/a&gt;. This is statistical genetics jargon for the fact that variation at a single locus in the genome can affect many traits simultaneously. Whereas one might think naïvely that there are distinct genes affecting individual traits, in reality the genome is a complex web of interactions among its constituent parts, leading to extensive pleiotropy. In some cases pleiotropy can be &lt;em&gt;antagonistic&lt;/em&gt;, which means that a genomic variant may simultaneously be harmful and beneficial. A famous example of this is the mutation to the beta globin gene that confers malaria resistance to heterozygotes (individuals with just one of their DNA copies carrying the mutation) and sickle cell anemia to homozygotes (individuals with both copies of their DNA carrying the mutation). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the case of complex diseases we don’t really know enough, or anything, about the genome to be able to truly assess pleiotropy risks (or benefits). But there are some worries already. For example, HLA Class II genes are associated with Type I and non-insulin treated Type 2 diabetes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/105/3/e245/5715056&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jacobi et al 2020&lt;/a&gt;), Parkinson’s disease (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jneurology.com/articles/shared-human-leukocyte-antigen-hla-coverage-in-dementia-and-parkinsons-disease.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;James and Georgopolous 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which also describes an association with dementia) and Alzheimer’s (&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12017-020-08612-4&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wang and Xing 2020&lt;/a&gt;). PES that results in selection against the variants associated with these diseases could very well lead to population susceptibility to infectious disease. Having said that, it is worth repeating that we don’t really know if the danger is serious, because we don’t have any idea what the vast majority of the genome does, nor the nature of antagonistic pleiotropy present in it. Almost certainly by selecting for one trait according to PRS, embryos will also be selected for a host of other unknown traits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thus, what can be said is that while Orchid Health is trying to convince potential customers to not “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/noor_siddiqui_/status/1357768845818232834&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;roll the dice&lt;/a&gt;“, by ignoring the complexities of pleiotropy and its implications for embryo selection, what the company is actually doing is in fact&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;rolling the dice for its customers (for a fee).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Population problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orchidhealth.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Orchid Health’s selling points&lt;/a&gt; is that unlike other tests that “look at 2% of only one partner’s genome…Orchid sequences 100% of both partner’s genomes” resulting in “6 billion data points”. This refers to the “couples report”, which is a companion product of sorts to the polygenic embryo screening. The couples report is assembled by using the sequenced genomes of parents to simulate the genomes of potential babies, each of which is evaluated for PRS’ to provide a range of (PRS based) disease predictions for the couples potential children. Sequencing a whole genome is a lot more expensive that just assessing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a panel. That may be one reason that most direct-to-consumer genetics is based on polymorphism panels rather than sequencing. There is another: the vast majority of variation in the genome occurs at a known polymorphic sites (there are a few million out of the approximately 3 billion base pairs in the genome), and to the extent that a variant might associate with a disease, it is likely that a neighboring common variant, which will be inherited together with the causal one, can serve as a proxy. There are rare variants that have been shown to associate with disease, but whether or not they explain can explain a large fraction of (genetic) disease burden is still an open question (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?rev=2&amp;amp;id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008222&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Young 2019&lt;/a&gt;). So what has Siddiqui, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://mendelspod.com/podcasts/orchid-health-first-world-offer-whole-genome-couples-report/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;touts the benefits of whole-genome sequencing in a recent interview&lt;/a&gt;, discovered that others such as 23andme have missed? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It turns out there is value to whole-genome sequencing for polygenic risk score analysis, but it is when one is performing the genome-wide association studies on which the PRS are based. The reason is a bit subtle, and has to do with differences in genetics between populations. Specifically, as explained in (&lt;a href=&quot;https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-018-0610-x&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;De La Vega and Bustamante, 2018&lt;/a&gt;), variants that associate with a disease in one population may be different than variants that associate with the disease in another population, and whole-genome sequencing across populations can help to mitigate biases that result when restricting to SNP panels. Unfortunately, as De La Vega and Bustamante note, whole-genome sequencing for GWAS “would increase costs by orders of magnitude”. In any case, the value of whole-genome sequencing for PRS lies mainly in identifying relevant variants, not in assessing risk in individuals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issue of population structure affecting PRS unfortunately transcends considerations about whole-genome sequencing. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/psychgenetics/Fulltext/2018/10000/Polygenic_risk_score_for_schizophrenia_is_more.2.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Curtis 2018&lt;/a&gt;) shows that PRS for schizophrenia is more strongly associated with ancestry than with the disease. Specifically, he shows that “The PRS for schizophrenia varied significantly between ancestral groups and was much higher in African than European HapMap subjects. The mean difference between these groups was 10 times as high as the mean difference between European schizophrenia cases and controls. The distributions of scores for African and European subjects hardly overlapped.” The figure from Curtis’ paper showing the distribution of PRS for schizophrenia across populations is displayed below (the three letter codes at the bottom are abbreviations for different population groups; CEU stands for Northern Europeans from Utah and is the lowest).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/original.00041444-201810000-00002.f1-2.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14719&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;14719&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Original.00041444-201810000-00002.F1-2&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/original.00041444-201810000-00002.f1-2.jpeg?w=490&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/original.00041444-201810000-00002.f1-2.jpeg?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/original.00041444-201810000-00002.f1-2.jpeg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;498,500&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2021/04/12/the-amoral-nonsense-of-orchids-embryo-selection/original-00041444-201810000-00002-f1-2/&quot; height=&quot;-105&quot; src=&quot;https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/original.00041444-201810000-00002.f1-2.jpeg?w=498&quot; width=&quot;-105&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dependence of PRS on population is a problem that is compounded by a general problem with GWAS, namely that Europeans and individuals of European descent have been significantly oversampled in GWAS. Furthermore, even within a single ancestry group, the prediction accuracy of PRS can depend on confounding factors such as socio-economic status (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/48376&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mostafavi et al. 2020&lt;/a&gt;). Practically speaking, the implications for PES are beyond troubling. The PRS scores in the reports customers of Orchid Health may be inaccurate or meaningless due to not only the genetic background or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_admixture&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;admixture&lt;/a&gt; of the parents involved, but also other unaccounted for factors. Embryo selection on the basis of such data becomes worse than just throwing dice, it can potentially lead to unintended consequences in the genomes of the selected embryos. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0379-x&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Martin et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;) show unequivocally that clinical use of polygenic risk scores may exacerbate health disparities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People pathos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact that Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are jumping aboard a technically incoherent venture and are willing to set aside serious ethical and moral concerns is not very surprising. See, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/theranos-response-to-wsj-doubts-about-new-technology-2015-10&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Theranos&lt;/a&gt;, which was supported by its investors despite concerns being raised about the technical foundations of the company. After a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;critical story &lt;/a&gt;appeared in the Wall Street Journal, the company put out a statement that &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Bad stories]…come along when you threaten to change things, seeded by entrenched interests that will do anything to prevent change, but in the end nothing will deter us from making our tests the best and of the highest integrity for the people we serve, and continuing to fight for transformative change in health care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-investors-duped-by-the-theranos-fraud-never-asked-for-one-important-thing-2018-03-19&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;did bother a few investors at the time&lt;/a&gt;, many stayed the course for a while longer. Siddiqui uses similar language, brushing off criticism by complaining about paternalism in the health care industry and gatekeeping, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/orchid-launches-reports-to-help-couples-have-healthy-babies-by-quantifying-genetic-risk-301261496.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stating that&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re in an age of seismic change in biotech – the ability to sequence genomes, the ability to edit genomes, and now the unprecedented ability to impact the health of a future child.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her investors, many of whom got rich from cryptocurrency trading or bitcoin, cheer her on. One of her investors is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase&lt;/a&gt;, who believes “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/orchid-launches-reports-to-help-couples-have-healthy-babies-by-quantifying-genetic-risk-301261496.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Orchid is] a step towards where we need to go in medicine.&lt;/a&gt;” I think I can understand some of the ego and money incentives of Silicon Valley that drive such sentiment. But one thing that disappoints me is that scientists I personally held in high regard, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.stanford.edu/jan-liphardt&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jan Liphardt&lt;/a&gt; (associate professor of Bioengineering at Stanford) who is on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orchidhealth.com/careers#scientists&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scientific advisory board&lt;/a&gt; and Carlos Bustamante (co-author of the paper about population structure associated biases in PRS mentioned above) who is an investor in Orchid Health, have associated themselves with the company. It’s also very disturbing that Anne Wojcicki, the CEO of 23andme whose team of statistical geneticists understand the subtleties of PRS, still went ahead and invested in the company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Orchid Health’s polygenic embryo selection, which it will be offering later this year, is unethical and morally repugnant. My suggestion is to think twice before &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10JnJomtaCrGi0HE8r2EnwGvPzE4vJWAMHUR0HMXQcIg/viewform?edit_requested=true&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sending them three years of tax returns&lt;/a&gt; to try to get a discount on their product.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/vaccine-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managing the spread of infectious diseases has taken on heightened significance over the last year, as COVID-19 swept the world. Terms like ‘contact tracing’ and ‘vaccine trials’ have become hot discussion topics for the general population, not just those who work in public health or medical research. But the research I want to share here was research conducted before coronavirus was even ‘a thing’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2019, we set out to uncover what the top priorities are when dealing with a &lt;em&gt;measles&lt;/em&gt; outbreak, particularly in a region where there might be lower than average vaccination rates. We conducted a multi-round survey (an interactive method known as a Delphi survey) with a range of Australian health professionals who are responsible for managing and responding to a disease outbreak: public health officials, infectious disease experts, immunization program staff, and others involved in delivering vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal was to find out what they see as the priority issues when trying to contain an outbreak. We asked our participants to imagine a measles outbreak in a hypothetical region known for its low levels of childhood vaccination coverage. We asked them what practical issues and challenges they would face, and what they would need from non-vaccinating members of the community to effectively manage the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study we undertook is part of a broader project called UPCaV for short – ‘Understanding, Parenting, Communities and Vaccination’. This project has been examining vaccine refusal and hesitancy in Australia from a range of different perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all parents who refuse vaccines for their children are “anti-vaxxers”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An earlier phase of the project involved in-depth interviews with Australian parents who refuse some or all vaccines for their children. Some of the findings from that phase have been published by Wiley et al (2020). Parents reported feeling stigmatized, bullied, disrespected and misunderstood. Notably, not all parents who refuse vaccines for their children are “anti-vaxxers”, a label that has become increasingly used in media reporting and one that tends to close down conversation rather than open it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to combat misinformation, while considered important by the people we surveyed, was deemed a longer-term strategy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that stood out the most for me from our Delphi survey, was that trying to combat misinformation, while considered important by the people we surveyed, was deemed a longer-term strategy. Trying to change the minds of vaccine-refusers was not considered a priority during an outbreak, nor was offering vaccination. Participants’ first priority was to contact potentially infected people and isolate vulnerable members of the community in order to halt the spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I found compelling in our findings, were the responses to a question about what strategies are most successful for countering mistrust among non-vaccinating parents during an outbreak. Recurring responses to this question were the need for patience and calm education. Panellists suggested it was important to highlight to parents the serious complications that can arise from measles. And they suggested that it is important not to get into arguments with non-vaccinating members of the community, but instead to offer reassurance, provide accurate information and to acknowledge different beliefs. These comments were exciting to see because they align so well with previous research I’ve been involved with, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.talkingaboutimmunisation.org.au/&quot;&gt;Sharing Knowledge About Immunisation&lt;/a&gt; (SKAI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following two quotes from participants struck a chord with me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Reassurance, patience, education may help with those people that are still ‘sitting on the fence’ about vaccination.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Recognizing and acknowledging people’s beliefs, however conveying facts and not getting drawn into a discussion or arguments.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these participants were talking about an imagined measles outbreak, their perspectives have significance for how we respond to other disease threats and how we communicate effectively with diverse populations. As I write this (April 2021), the COVID-19 vaccines have begun to be rolled out in Australia. While the questions in our survey were about measles, the implications for how best to manage the threat of disease, while also communicating in an open, thoughtful and compassionate way, especially with people who might be feeling nervous about vaccinations, is timely.&lt;/p&gt;

An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/170863&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;influential paper&lt;/a&gt; by David E. Bell considered the implications of disappointment, a psychological reaction caused by comparing an actual outcome to a more optimistic expected outcome, as in playing the lottery. Equations for regret, disappointment, elation, and satisfaction have been incorporated into economic models of financial decision-making (e.g., variants of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prospect theory&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial choices comprise one critical aspect of decision-making in our daily lives.

EIGHTY-FIVE PERCENT.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world would be easier to navigate if we could base our decisions on an abundance of data and well-tuned weighting functions accessible to the human brain. Right? Like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/994181&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;computational model of trust and reputation&lt;/a&gt; or a model of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hawkrobe/status/1376710875524919304&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;how people choose to allocate effort in social interactions&lt;/a&gt;. Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm out of my element here, so this will limit my understanding of these models. Which brings me to a more familiar topic: meta-commentary on interpretation (and extrapolation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Computational Decision-Making&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;I'm thinking  about writing a blog post entitled, &quot;Overinterpreting Computational  Models of Decision-Making&quot;. And by &quot;overinterpreting&quot; I mean claiming  results from a binary probabilistic decision-making task have  implications for individualized cognitive behavioral therapies.&lt;/p&gt;— sarcastic_f (@sarcastic_f) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarcastic_f/status/1371242065837748227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My motivation for writing this post was annoyance. And despair. A study on probabilistic decision-making under uncertain and volatile conditions came to the conclusion that people with anxiety and depression will benefit from focusing on past successes, instead of failures. Which kinda goes without saying. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/61387&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paper in &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was far more measured and sophisticated, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/12/22/in-shaky-times-focus-on-past-successes-if-overly-anxious-depressed/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The more chaotic things get, the harder it is for people with clinical anxiety and/or depression to make sound decisions and to learn from their mistakes. On a positive note, overly anxious and depressed people’s judgment can improve if they focus on what they get right, instead of what they get wrong...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...researchers tested the probabilistic decision-making skills of more than 300 adults, including people with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. In probabilistic decision making, people, &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;often without being aware of it&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, use the positive or negative results of their previous actions to inform their current decisions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unaware shall become aware. &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/12/22/in-shaky-times-focus-on-past-successes-if-overly-anxious-depressed/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Further advice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“When everything keeps changing rapidly, and you get a bad outcome from a decision you make, you might fixate on what you did wrong, which is often the case with clinically anxious or depressed people...” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...individualized treatments, such as cognitive behavior therapy, could improve both decision-making skills and confidence by focusing on past successes, instead of failures...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final statement on individualized CBT could very well be true, but it has nothing to do with the outcome of the study (&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/61387&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gagne et al., 2021&lt;/a&gt;), wherein participants chose between two shapes associated with differential probabilities of receiving electric shock (Exp. 1), or financial gain or loss (Exp. 2).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VZS_oP9_w44/YGUu7EowltI/AAAAAAAANSU/Nt4ey7X5uVogq4qiv19AGPYvzFygKvMggCLcBGAsYHQ/s856/decision-making%2Bunder%2Bvolatility.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;381&quot; data-original-width=&quot;856&quot; height=&quot;178&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VZS_oP9_w44/YGUu7EowltI/AAAAAAAANSU/Nt4ey7X5uVogq4qiv19AGPYvzFygKvMggCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h178/decision-making%2Bunder%2Bvolatility.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;With that out of the way, I will say the experiments and the computational modeling approach are impressive. The theme is probabilistic decision-making under uncertainty, with the added bonus of volatility in the underlying causal structure (e.g., the square is suddenly associated a higher probability of shocks). People with anxiety disorders and depression are generally intolerant of  uncertainty. Learning the stimulus-outcome contingencies and then  rapidly adapting to change was predictably impaired. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does this general finding differ for learning under reward vs. punishment? For anxiety vs. depression? In the past, depression was associated with altered learning under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17586866&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reward&lt;/a&gt;, while  anxiety was associated with altered learning under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15885654&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;punishment&lt;/a&gt; (including in the authors' &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25730669&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;own work&lt;/a&gt;). For reasons that were not entirely clear to me, the authors chose to classify symptoms using a bifactor model designed to capture “internalizing psychopathology” common to both anxiety and depression vs. symptoms that are unique to each disorder [ &lt;i&gt;but see&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1047840X.2020.1853461&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fried (2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) ]&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800180;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, high scores on the common internalizing factor were associated with impaired adjustments to learning rate during the volatile condition, and this held whether the outcomes were shocks, financial gains, or financial losses. Meanwhile, high scores on anxiety-unique or depression-unique symptoms did not show this relationship. This was determined by computational modeling of task performance, using a hierarchical Bayesian framework to identify the model that best described the participants' behavior:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We fitted participants’ choice behavior using alternate versions of simple reinforcement learning models. We focused on models that were parameterized in a sufficiently flexible manner to capture differences in behavior between experimental conditions (block type: volatile versus stable; task version: reward gain versus aversive) and differences in learning from better or worse than expected outcomes. We used a hierarchical Bayesian approach to estimate distributions over model parameters at an individual- and population-level with the latter capturing variation as a function of general, anxiety-specific, and depression-specific internalizing symptoms. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've been living in a very uncertain world for more than a year now, often in a state of loneliness and isolation. Some of us have experienced loss after loss, deteriorating mental health, lack of motivation, lack of purpose, and difficulty making decisions. My snappish response to the press release concerns whether we can prescribe individualized therapies based on the differences between the yellow arrows on the left (“resilient people”) compared to the right (“internalizing people” — i.e., the anxious and depressed), given that the participants may not even realize they're learning anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-87TJ1MSMXCM/YGVHQRC0-MI/AAAAAAAANSc/h74SjsZGZzgce73aSxA4SoFNjc-o0-VGgCLcBGAsYHQ/s709/good%2Boutcome%2Bvolatile.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;709&quot; data-original-width=&quot;697&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-87TJ1MSMXCM/YGVHQRC0-MI/AAAAAAAANSc/h74SjsZGZzgce73aSxA4SoFNjc-o0-VGgCLcBGAsYHQ/w394-h400/good%2Boutcome%2Bvolatile.png&quot; width=&quot;394&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Footnote&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800180;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I will leave it to Dr. Eiko Fried (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1047840X.2020.1853461&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;) to explain whether we should accept (or reject) this bifactor model of “shared symptoms” vs. “unshared symptoms”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bell DE.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/person-2244036_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-harm is often the result of a complex interplay of genetic- biological, psychological and environmental factors. Bullying is one aspect that can increase the risk of self-harm. However not all adolescents who experience bullying harm themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bullies are also at risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not only being the victim of bullying that is related to self-harm, but also being a bully aggressor. In fact, in our study we found that adolescents who are both bullies and are bullied by their peers (the bully-victims), were the group most vulnerable to self-harm. They were six times more likely to self-harm than adolescents who weren’t bullies or bullied&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible that the “bully-victims” have the broadest range of adjustment problems, presenting difficulties common to both bullies and victims. An earlier study found that many of the bully-victims first have a history of being bullied, and then begin to bully peers later in adolescence. Thus, they suffer from both emotional and behavioral problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is there a relationship between self-harm and bullying behavior?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both bullying victimization and self-harm are associated with emotional problems such as anxiety and depression. In our study we found that emotional problems and parental conflicts were important factors for the association between the bullied adolescents and self-harm, and between the bully-victims and self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study showed that school behavioral problems also accounted for some of the relationship between self-harm and the bullies, and self-harm and bully-victims. This confirms the idea that the act of bullying is part of a broader concept of conduct behavioral problems with aggressive and delinquent behaviors, school failure, and drop out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parental support and school well-being&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;School well-being (including support from teacher) was protective of self-harm for the bullies and the bully-victims&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we see that those who are bullied and/or bullies may be more likely to engage in self-harm, we know that not everyone who is bullied or bullies self-harms. We therefore investigated what might protect against self-harm amongst the bullies, bullied and bully-victims. We found that although parental support had a protective effect on self-harm among boys and girls in general, it was especially important for those who are bullied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows that the willingness to talk to and seek help from parents during a difficult time like bullying, may protect against self-harm among adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were surprised to also find that school well-being (including support from teacher) was protective of self-harm for the bullied and the bully-victims. Our result appears to be the first to investigate the buffering effect of school well-being on bullying behavior and self-harm among adolescents. This is an important result for the prevention of self-harm. Schools, parents, and health care professionals should be aware of the importance of school well-being for adolescents who are being bullied, in terms of identifying those at risk of self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How frequent is self-harm?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study showed that fifteen percent of participating adolescents reported engaging in self-harm during the last year. This is consistent with earlier studies finding the 12-month prevalence rate to be between 10 to 19% around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3348041/&quot;&gt;the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who participated in the study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data we used in this study was the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ungdata.no/english/&quot;&gt;Ungdata&lt;/a&gt;” that is a cross-sectional, large, national survey, designed for adolescents. A total of 14 093 adolescents aged 12 to 19 years, from different parts of Norway, participated in the study; this was 87% of those invited to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data was collected at one point in time and therefore we do not know if the bullying occurred prior to self-harm. However, previous longitudinal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890856713001834&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that bullying increased the risk of self-harm and not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we measured self-harm and bulling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We measured self-harm by asking if the adolescents had tried to harm them self in the past 12 months. Bullied was measured by asking adolescent if they had been teased, threatened, or frozen out by other young people in school, free time, online, or on their mobile phones. Bullying other peers was measured by asking if they had taken part in teasing, threatening or freezing out out other young people at school, free time, online or by mobile phone. We created a new variable to measure those both being bullied and who bully others (the bully-victims), by combining the variables “Bullied” and “Bullying other peers”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of parental support and school well-being may buffer the harmful relationship between bullying behavior and self-harm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a strong link between bullying and self-harm. Interventions to address bullying may reduce self-harm. Our findings also suggest that high levels of parental support and school well-being may buffer the harmful relationship between bullying behavior and self-harm. Addressing these factors may be important in reducing the risk of self-harm among those experiencing bullying.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/IQFg2gChmhg/"/>
		<id>https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18771</id>
		<updated>2021-03-31T04:59:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; has adopted an enhanced &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/code-availability&quot;&gt;code sharing policy&lt;/a&gt; for all papers submitted from 30 March 2021. The change, announced in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008867&quot;&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt;, comes in response to community needs and support for initiatives which drive Open Science practices. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Community drivers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Code sharing is not new to many of our authors. Research shows that 41% of papers in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; already share code voluntarily (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008725&quot;&gt;Boudreau &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; 2021&lt;/a&gt;), demonstrating the community’s willingness to make their work both rapidly available and methodologically transparent. This creates a strong foundation for implementing a stronger policy and also works towards establishing code sharing as a normal research behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; defines “open” as more than the availability of a research article. Our authors, editors, and readers see data and code sharing as tools to boost reproducibility and transparency. Sharing code alongside data will allow others to check and reproduce work and ultimately drive new discoveries. Requiring authors to share their code (unless there are good reasons not to) works towards making the research published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; as robust as possible for the benefit of the whole research community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In developing &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/code-availability&quot;&gt;the policy&lt;/a&gt; we sought views from researchers in the computational community on the barriers they face when sharing code (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13366025&quot;&gt;Harney &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. 2021&lt;/a&gt;). We then tested our policy text with researchers to help inform its design and content. This has allowed us to respond to researcher needs, for example by allowing exemptions to the policy for those with legitimate legal or ethical constraints on sharing. In this way, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; continues to be shaped by policies the community has helped define, and Open Science values that reflect the way they want to communicate research. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Open Science at PLOS&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Open Science is one of our founding principles at PLOS. Enhancing the code sharing policy at one of our journals in response to community needs is just one step we are making to increase the adoption of Open Science practices. We aim to empower researchers to share their good practices because we believe communities are best placed to define their own needs. The computational biology community is shaping the future of research communication by leading the way in practices that make science more open and equitable for all. However, we do offer guidance and help to those who need it, for example, by detailing best practice for code sharing alongside our policy text. No matter how researchers choose to make their work Open, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; provides options to support researcher needs and the platform to influence broader change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Collaboration with the community and responding to their needs is part of our approach to Open Science, regardless of how that community is defined. We will be closely monitoring the reaction to the code sharing policy at &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; and exploring what an enhanced policy could mean for other communities that we serve. &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content&quot;&gt;Neuromatch Academy 2020&lt;/a&gt; is a three-week online summer school in computational neuroscience that took place in July of 2020. We created interactive notebooks covering all aspects of computational neuroscience – from signals and models of spikes to machine learning and behaviour. We hired close to 200 TAs to teach this material to 1,700 students from all over the world in an inverted classroom setting. Over 87% of students that started the class finished it, a number unheard of in the MOOC space. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08973&quot;&gt;we have a preprint out&lt;/a&gt;, and NMA has been covered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02347-9&quot;&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(21)00074-0/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email&quot;&gt;the Lancet&lt;/a&gt;. So how did we do it? Building something that goes from 0 to several hundred volunteers working tirelessly is a huge endeavor, and I’m sure a lot of the readers of this blog coming from an academic background have trouble even imagining how you can get something like that off the ground. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rdgao.com/blog/2020/09/16/&quot;&gt;Richard Gao wrote a great post&lt;/a&gt; on how it felt to be flying in this anarchist hacker spaceship as it was being built. I wanted to share some thoughts with you that I hope will be helpful if you ever want to create an experience at this scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;A little background: my stint into teaching&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After my time at Facebook, I wanted to focus on the academic route. I became interested in teaching and taught an introductory CS class at a local college, building my materials from scratch. I thought, rather naively, that since I knew CS, this would be fairly straightforward. But preparing course materials materials for beginners is anything but easy. One issue is the curse of expertise: if you know a subject pretty well it becomes harder to explain it to a novice. For example, here’s my explanation of globals in Python:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python has two scopes: module and function. You have read access to module variables inside of a function. However, if you want to write to a module variable it, you need to use the global keyword. Unless the variable is a reference type… If a variable is a dict or a list, for example, you can change its contents inside a function even if it’s a module variable. That’s because Python has pass-by-ref semantics for complex types. You see, default pass-by-ref semantics for complex types were originally introduced in fourth generation languages to get rid of the difficulty of granular pass-by-value or pass-by-ref semantics in languages like C. […many rambling minutes later…]. In any case, don’t use globals if you can avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although this explanation is technically correct, it doesn’t fit with novice students’ current development, and giving that explanation is more likely to make them feel inadequate than enlightened. It takes a tremendous amount of attention to detail, radical empathy and craftsmanship to understand the adult learner’s motivations – both intrinsic and extrinsic – and to create materials that engage them at the right level. And creating this stuff takes a huge amount of time! By the time I finished the class, I was ready to throw away the material I created. At the same time, it felt quixotic to take half a year off to craft the perfect materials for a class that was going to be taken by ~15 students a semester. The lack of good materials meant that I had to spend much of my time in class on adjusting materials dynamically – at the end of the day, I was completely exhausted. Surely, there must be a better way!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response to the global pandemic, Chris Piech and Mehran Sahami decided to offer the first half of the  introductory Stanford CS class to students at large, an experiment called &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Code in Place&lt;/a&gt;. Over 800 section leaders signed up to give 6 weeks of instruction on core computational concepts in Python. Here was a completely different approach to teaching a subject: very high quality materials crafted over years at Stanford – &lt;a href=&quot;https://compedu.stanford.edu/karel-reader/docs/python/en/chapter1.html&quot;&gt;including a robot-control environment in Python called Karel&lt;/a&gt; – given in a hybrid setting, with the section leader (aka TA) holding Q&amp;amp;A sessions and solving test problems with students in an inverted classroom setting. And it worked! Students were engaged and stuck around, and they worked on self-directed projects to continue their learning. What I found is that by not having to focus so much on materials prep and the fallout from having so-so materials, I had more time to connect with the students on an emotional, social level – understanding what they’re stuck on, where they’re coming from, what their motivations are, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks into Code In Place, I came across Konrad Kording’s Twitter post looking for NMA volunteers. By that time, they had a core team – Megan in the Exec role, Sean as finance guru, Brad as ops, Konrad as dreamer, Gunnar and Paul on curriculum. They had just gotten started, they needed people with technical skills. I took on the technical chair, things escalated, and within a few weeks I was CTO and along with many other, was doing NMA full time. My time in industry proved to be an asset  – working with short deadlines, focusing on shipping, and managing relationships with a large interdisciplinary team. Pretty soon, I was helping coordinate dozens of volunteers, a growth experience that I didn’t know I was ready for. So &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2020/02/18/how-i-got-a-job-in-industry/&quot;&gt;if you’re wondering whether industry is right for you&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to build big things and manage big collaborations in the future, I think it’s a great place to get that experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Deciding what to build&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you first get started on a large project like this, you get overwhelmed with ideas about what it is that you’re trying to build. One framework for orienting your thoughts are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism&quot;&gt;Heilmeier questions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the risks?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How much will it cost?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How long will it take?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you can answer these questions, you know what you’re building, and you can get a team to congregate around those ideas. This isn’t very different, conceptually, from writing a grant. For us, it was really the fundraising document that formalized a lot of our early brainstorming The answer to these questions could be written simply as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’re building an online, 3-week intensive summer school in computational neuroscience. It will be cheap (100$ or less to attend) and accessible to all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Traditional summer schools offer a great experience and the chance to create life-long scientific networks, but they are elitist and expensive. MOOCs are cheap and accessible to all but a vanishingly small percentage of people actually complete them because they don’t foster belonging. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We create high-quality videos and interactive notebooks and we deliver them in pods of students matched to TAs. We offer the close-knit experience of traditional summer schools with the accessibility of MOOCs in a new hybrid model. People are bored and alone because of COVID so we have a unique opportunity to show that this online inverted classroom model can work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ll bring cheap high-quality education to thousands of people and will set the standard for open source educational materials for years to come. We can bring the model to many other areas of science.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Execution risk and legal risk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1500$ for each TA, and we’re aiming for 200 TAs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’re launching July 13th&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ll track attendance, completion metrics, students surveys, website statistics, etc. to have a 360 view of our impact. Our core metric is completion of the class and we aim for 80% completion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within each committee, you can take Heilmeier’s questions and consider their relevance to your  committee’s duties. The curriculum committee’s goal might be to create high-quality materials for the class, while the technical committee might aim to deliver 99% uptime during the class. The point is to try to have clarity on your goals so that when crunch time happens you can prioritize.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Running on enthusiasm&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was really enthusiastic about taking what I learned from Code in Place and bringing that to computational neuroscience. The core team had been thinking about a new kind of summer school for years before NMA got started and they were ready to tap into their network to jump start the effort. In the early days, being enthusiastic about the project and having a great story to tell are instrumental in finding volunteers. We’re democratizing education! We’re bringing grad-level education to underserved communities! We’re doing something no one’s ever done! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I volunteer at a soup kitchen, and one thing they emphasized during our training is that a volunteer’s time is a  gift. You have to have a pipeline that translates a volunteer’s enthusiasm into action, otherwise you’re refusing to accept that gift, and that’s frustrating for the volunteer. At first, we would bring new people into our slack workspace and expected them to find their way. We realized pretty soon that having people in the slack is just the first step – you need to have a plan to retain volunteers. This became especially true as the slack workspace shot up to hundreds, sometimes thousands of messages a day. Empathize with those poor people just joining in being bombarded with way too much information! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the technical committee, what worked well to engage new volunteers is to do a task triage. There’s a backlog of stuff that needs to be done – update the website, crank out some forms, clean up the github page, prepare the forum, etc. In a synchronous meeting, you go through the backlog and people volunteer to take on different tasks. That means your committee head needs to have tasks partly groomed beforehand. They pull up the Kanban board during the meeting and fill it in – we used &lt;a href=&quot;http://quire.io/&quot;&gt;quire&lt;/a&gt;, but Asana or even just a Google doc could work equally well. Everybody gets a chance to pitch in, and confusion about the scope of each task can be resolved during the meeting. It’s also a big team-building exercise: you get to see other people pitch in. We applied this method to build several efforts, including bootstrapping the technical team, the video editing team, the waxers team (see later), community managers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you prefer the asynchronous route, Github tasks with a good-for-first-timers tag can be useful. Regardless of the software you use, you want to embody openness: you want tasks to be done to be radically transparent and for volunteers to feel maximal agency. This is a common model for open source communities that can be fruitfully adapted to education.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Running like clockwork&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Assigning tasks of different sizes and priority as a backlog grooming session is great to engage new volunteers, but you will also need to do time-sensitive tasks. For time-sensitive things, you need a Gantt chart with a detailed day-by-day breakdown of tasks to be done with somebody accountable for each task (the single-threaded owner). I was taught the arcane art of Gantt charts by my colleagues Keith and Frances at Facebook, alums of Fitbit and the Apple hardware team. Let me tell you something, if you want to get stuff done on time, somebody that knows how to ship hardware will make it happen – when you build consumer products, you have to ship them on time, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an online summer school, that means having deadlines for student admissions, TA applications, first drafts of content, second drafts of content, reviews, editing, posting on github, etc. for every single day of content. The deadlines should be visible to everybody, and the people responsible for them should be accountable. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emdupre&quot;&gt;Elizabeth DuPre&lt;/a&gt; pointed me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_4EX4dPppA&amp;amp;ab_channel=StrangeLoopConference&quot;&gt;this talk by the creator of Elm&lt;/a&gt; – in open source projects, the right culture doesn’t just happen by accident, culture happens because norms are defined and reinforced. “Deadlines matter” is a norm that is different than what most people are used to in the context of giving instruction. If you’re giving your own class, you can keep editing your slides up to 2 minutes before the class. You can’t do that at NMA – your slides will be reviewed, your video recording will be edited, your video will be captioned, etc. – if you hand in your slides late, everybody down the pipeline suffers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want deadlines to matter you have to will them into existence by making them a norm inside of an organization and reinforcing that by making them visible to everybody. Keeping track of these deadlines eventually led to a daily cadence of standups, which I ran – ironic because I always hated standups in industry. Konrad once called me “a little German” for my insistence on deadlines, which is very funny since I’m almost absurdly disorganized in my personal life.  Being inside of a big org is different. &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractualism/&quot;&gt;It’s an embodiment of a deeper principle of contractualism&lt;/a&gt; – we define and agree on what we owe to each other and bind ourselves to that, and that’s what defines morality within our community. The upside of that is the contract is multilateral. When we couldn’t get the ideal matching method between TAs and students to work on time, but we had a “good enough” version that was working, I could say to others that we have to ship the good enough version today, because we agreed to it; it gave me cover, even though it was an unpopular decision. That kind of clarity in planning and expectations avoids a lot of friction later on. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;You need good tools to work productively with each other&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month&quot;&gt;The Mythical Man-Month&lt;/a&gt;, Fred Brooks claims that “adding [more programmers] to a late software project makes it later”. When you have dozens of contributors to an open-source education curriculum, how do you avoid that? You need good tools. One of the first things that the technical team worked on was a smoke test for notebooks. We were worried that one of the notebooks that we use for teaching might break. Notebooks are designed for exploration and can be pretty brittle – a simple cell execution order inconsistency can break a notebook. If multiple people are editing and pushing notebooks, it’s almost guaranteed that a notebook will break at some point. If a notebook is broken, an individual TA might not have enough context to diagnose the problem, and we would have to broadcast to our 200 TAs a fix, which would be stressful for TA and student alike.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So we started with a really simple smoke test, written by Marco. When you push notebooks to Github, the continuous integration kicks in, runs your notebook from scratch, and check whether it runs. From these humble beginnings, Michael Waskom built an intricate continuous integration (CI) pipeline to check that the code runs, that the style is consistent, and to generate versions of the notebooks for students and TAs, etc. This is the thing that allowed the editors to push better versions of the notebooks on a regular basis, and proved invaluable during a time crunch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we used an online video editing tool (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wevideo.com/&quot;&gt;WeVideo&lt;/a&gt;) rather than an offline one because it allowed multiple people to contribute to video editing. That allowed Tara to oversee a dozen video editors and reassign tasks when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;You need good organization to work productively with each&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to get a lot of people to contribute lots of content is to have them work in silos. Each of our instruction days was more or less independent of the others, so it made sense to have different people work on each independently. The downside to this approach is that it makes for a jumbled experience for the student. Novice learners, who don’t yet have proficiency in a subject, can easily be thrown off by a change in notation, nomenclature, or tone. Day leaders created one pagers far ahead of the content so we could diagnose missing prerequisites, incompatible learning objectives and big bumps in difficulty throughout the days. But that wasn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biggest contributors to a smooth experience for the students were pre-pods and waxers. When I was giving an introductory CS class, I could see the looks of confusion on student’s faces. I could adjust the content in realtime (a high-wire experience, do not recommend). Ideally I would have had another test classroom run through the content in real time to give me detailed notes so I could improve the content before I gave the class in front of the actual students. That’s exactly what we did with pre-pods: we hired a dozen TAs to test the content 3 weeks before the real class (pods before the real ones; hence pre-pods). They gave 360 feedback at the micro level (e.g. typos) and macro level (e.g. changes in difficulty from day to day) which could then be taken into account by the content creators. It’s not adversarial like peer review can sometimes feel – everybody is on the same side. It’s similar to UI/UX testing, where you put your product in front of naive users and watch them destroy it from the other side of the one-way mirror so you can make a better product. &lt;a href=&quot;https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/design-thinking/steps/introduction/&quot;&gt;This kind of design thinking&lt;/a&gt; – ship early, ship often, iterate – can be applied to all aspects of open source education.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other thing we realized is that writing good notebooks is really hard: it requires the confluence  understanding the content (domain knowledge in comp neuro), programming, and radical empathy towards the learner (caring about androgogy). You also need an understanding of the house style,  context across days, and knowing the quirks of the Github CI. We needed a dedicated team to polish content, the waxers (we call them editors outside of NMA, but internally the name stuck). Waxers had to have the most stressful job of all, and I would often see messages exchanged on slack at 3-4 in the morning about content that needed to be ready for the next day. But it worked! The notebooks were a highlight of the NMA experience, and they will keep giving value to the community for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ella, Michael, Tara, Madineh and I presented our pipeline for the content in this talk:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jetpack-video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Making decisions under uncertainty&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How do you make decisions swiftly and effectively in a big org? We had hundreds of volunteers; &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/9fp4v/&quot;&gt;134 authors on the curriculum paper alone&lt;/a&gt;. 134 very smart people cannot all be of the same opinion at the same time in the face of uncertainty. The first step to make decisions effectively is to separate decision making and execution. It’s very easy to leave a lot of decisions to be implicit until it’s crunch time. It happened a couple of times that I made a medium-scale decision or encouraged other people to make medium-scale decisions during a daily standup meeting. Big mistake. A lot of people affected by the decisions weren’t in the room; they felt unheard and now burdened to go to a daily meeting to stay in the loop. Don’t do that – take bigger decisions in separate planning meetings. Every software methodology has some notion of a planning meeting, whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model&quot;&gt;waterfall&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)&quot;&gt;scrum&lt;/a&gt; or whatever – by the end of that meeting you should be clear about what to do for the next week or month. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One thing that can sap a lot of energy at these meetings is having circular arguments: revisiting the same question in subsequent meetings even though you thought you had come to an agreement. Sometimes, one person thinks a decision was made, while another thinks things were still under discussion. Write down decisions in meeting notes, share them with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some orgs in the for-profit sector are hierarchical, so that disagreements get resolved top-down. That doesn’t really work in the non-profit sector, where people are there on a volunteer basis. In non-profit and in open source communities, many orgs thus use consensus-based decision making. I think pure consensus-based decision making is very difficult to get right. I’m a member of a not-for-profit makerspace that’s built on anarchist principles. We use consensus-based decision-making, and it gets rowdy: flame wars on our message board are not infrequent, whether it’s about resource allocation and who gets the space when and whose responsibility it is to take the trash out. Pure consensus-based decision making can have an insidious effect that people that are not in agreement with the majority are left isolated as “difficult” and “not a team player”. That can breed resentment, which leads to personality clashes, which leads to dysfunction: decision making grinds to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s an alternative to pure consensus-based decision making: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit&quot;&gt;disagree and commit&lt;/a&gt;. You replace the norm that consensus must be reached with an alternative norm:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;everybody’s opinion should be understood &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;decisions are made based on majority or supermajority&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;it’s ok to disagree with a decision but we all bound ourselves to the decision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make sure that you understand somebody’s opinion – especially an opinion you don’t agree with –  you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://constantrenewal.com/steel-man/&quot;&gt;Steel Man technique&lt;/a&gt;. You restate the strongest version of their argument and engage with that. Oftentimes that will resolve whatever argument you had in the first place, or prepare you to build a hybrid solution. If you don’t come to a resolution, at least everyone will understand that they have been heard and understood. Decisions can take place in realtime in a synchronous meeting, or through a polling app in Slack (if a poll, put a deadline on it so it doesn’t drag on; in either case, quorum should be reached). If somebody disagreed with the decision, the norm says that that’s good and healthy, as long as they commit to the decision like everyone, so it doesn’t breed resentment in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Be the change you wish to see&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My manager at Facebook often talked about positive risk: if you shoot for the moon, sometimes you can actually overshoot and accomplish more than you intended. That always sounded like nonsense to me – &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law&quot;&gt;I’m a firm believer in Murphy’s law&lt;/a&gt; – but I had a chance to witness things going unexpectedly right at NMA. We planned many things, and delivered on what we planned, but perhaps our greatest success was fairly unexpected: pods worked. When we put students together with TAs, and had them interact closely for hours at a time in peer programming, they created bonds. Those bonds tapped into the students’ intrinsic motivation to be part of a community, and they felt belonging. When the going got tough, and they felt overwhelmed, they tapped into that support network to keep them going one more day. That’s how 87% of students managed to finish the class. One TA described the students tearing up on the last day and staying up till late in the morning to say goodbyes. Yes, materials are important, but in androgogy you also need to answer students’ emotional needs. That’s the biggest differentiator between NMA and a MOOC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building that experience required a ton of time from many dedicated and passionate people, people that wanted to make a difference. Sometimes emotions ran high and I butted heads – I can be a difficult person and that’s something I need to work on. Sometimes we had legitimate disagreements, but oftentimes we were just stressed and sleep-deprived, and we were able to apologize and move on. We were able to deliver a great experience, produce a new model for online learning, and we created bonds with each other that will follow us for a long time. Should you decide to embark on a expansive adventure like that? In the words of Edwin Land (stolen from Jack Gallant’s email signature):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t undertake a project unless it is manifestly important and nearly impossible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Edwin Land&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank the organizers, Megan, Brad, Gunnar, Konrad, Paul, Kate, Carsen, Xaq, Aina, Athena, Eric, John, Alex, Yiota, Emma and Beth; the waxers Michael, Madineh, Ella, Matt, Richard, Jesse, Byron, Saeed, Ameet, Spiros; everybody that contributed to technical, Titipat, Jeff, Marco, Arash, Adam, Natalie, Guga, and Tara; and everyone who contributed, whether a few hours or weeks at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Our ongoing partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://protocols.io/&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt; led to a new and exciting &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE &lt;/em&gt;article type, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/what-we-publish#loc-lab-protocols&quot;&gt;Lab Protocols&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a new avenue to share research in-line with the principles of Open Science. This two-part article type gives authors the best of both platforms: protocols.io hosts the step-by-step methodology details while &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; publishes a companion article that contextualizes the study and orchestrates peer review of the material. The end result is transparent and reproducible research that can help accelerate scientific discovery. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Read our interview with protocols.io CEO and co-founder Dr. Lenny Teytelman where he discusses what triggered the concept for the company, how researchers can benefit from this collaboration and how his team settled on such an adorable racoon logo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For those who are unfamiliar, what is protocols.io? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is a platform for developing and sharing reproducible methods. It serves both researchers needing secure and private collaboration and those aiming to share their knowledge publicly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the inspiration behind protocols.io? Did you have any particular experiences or issues as a researcher that led to you believing protocol sharing was an under-supported element of the scientific community? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was a year and a half of my postdoc that went into correcting just a single step of the microscopy methods that I was using. Instead of a microliter of a chemical, the step needed five, and instead of a fifteen-minute incubation with it, it needed an hour. The problem is that this isn’t a new technique but is a correction of a previously-published method. That means I didn’t get any credit for that year and a half, and everyone using this method was either getting misleading results or had to spend one or two years rediscovering what I know—rediscovering what I’d love to share with them, but didn’t have a good way of doing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the experience that led to my obsession with creating a central place to facilitate the sharing of such knowledge, within research groups and companies and broadly with the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As authors of &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; began to share methods, we realized that all researchers and disciplines had a need for a dedicated tool for proper method sharing… We now warmly welcome methods from all fields and disciplines, including psychology, social sciences, clinical, chemistry, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;– Lenny Teytelman, CEO and co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://protocols.io&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protocols.io launched in 2014 — how were the first few years? How were you able to make yourself known and show that your product is worthwhile and secure for researchers? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oh, you just touched on a painful topic. I actually gave a talk at a conference in 2018, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKJwKXZsmi4&quot;&gt;The harsh lessons from 4 years of community building at protocols.io&lt;/a&gt;. The first years were surprisingly rough. As an academic with zero entrepreneurial experience, I naively expected that once we build the platform, I’d tell my scientist friends that it exists, and through word of mouth, it would go viral. Turns out that it is not how new initiatives work. There is a lot of dedicated work needed to build the trust and visibility and simply let researchers know that you exist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It took the support of publishers, societies, funders, and Open Science and reproducibility champions to climb out of obscurity. Speaking of that support, the 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://theplosblog.plos.org/2017/04/protocols-io-tools-for-reproducibility/&quot;&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; between PLOS and protocols.io was critical in helping the research community learn about protocols.io.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has the platform evolved since then? What elements have been consistent and what have been some major changes? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our vision and mission have not really changed since 2014, but thanks to the constant feedback of the research community and a brilliant CTO and co-founder Alexei Stoliartchouk listening to that input, the product has grown from a rudimentary website to a powerful tool with amazing functionality to support the sharing of the method details and to help in the daily work of the researcher. For a fun comparison of where we were at launch in February 2014, take a look at our Kickstarter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1881346585/protocolsio-life-sciences-protocol-repository&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the early changes was in scope, a year after we launched. We initially thought that this is a platform for experimental wetlab scientists, but soon after launch, requests started to come to expand it to support computational/bioinformatics workflows. And then in 2017, there was another expansion in scope, catalyzed by that same 2017 partnership with PLOS. As authors of &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; began to share methods, we realized that all researchers and disciplines needed a dedicated tool for proper method sharing. This actually led us to change our welcome page from “Repository for Life Science Methods” to “Repository for Research Methods.” We now warmly welcome methods from all fields and disciplines, including psychology, social sciences, clinical, chemistry, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important is the new PLOS ONE Lab Protocol article type to the journey and mission of protocols.io? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon after our launch, when I realized that things don’t just “go viral”, I began to think a lot about incentives. It occurred to me some time in 2015 that it would be amazing if researchers had a way of turning their protocols into peer reviewed papers. I was looking at the &lt;em&gt;F1000Research&lt;/em&gt; model and wondering if we could add peer review to protocols.io. The problem was that our scope was so broad, we would need thousands of academic editors to be able to support the peer review — essentially we’d have to build &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;. Then, in 2017 when we started working with PLOS, I realized, “We don’t have to build &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;! It already exists; we just need to partner!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while this partnership is a big deal for protocols.io, I am particularly excited about it because of what it can do for reproducibility and Open Science. As I said when we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stm-publishing.com/plos-announces-two-new-peer-reviewed-article-types-for-plos-one/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the launch, “We’re thrilled to extend our partnership with PLOS by launching this new modular article type. This will provide authors with all of the benefits of rigorous peer review, plus a dynamic and interactive platform to present their protocols, with support for videos and precise details that are important for adopting and building upon the published methods.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What type of research does not need to be as fast as possible? Do malaria or pediatric cancer patients somehow have the luxury of time? Can our planet afford delays in climate research? Open and rapid sharing as we see today for COVID-19 must be the norm, not an exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;– Lenny Teytelman, on the importance of Open Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS and protocols.io have similar mission statements and nearby offices: how did this collaboration with PLOS start? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many people assume that our collaboration with PLOS is a consequence of me being co-advised as a graduate student by Professor Michael Eisen, co-founder of PLOS. That actually is not the case. It is true that as soon as I realized in 2012 that something like protocols.io needs to be built, I called Professor Eisen, described the idea, and said, “PLOS should build such a platform.” But he replied, “PLOS is a publisher, not a software developer. You need to build it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So in fact, it is the Chief Science Officer of PLOS, Dr. Veronique Kiermer, who is the key early lead on the PLOS/protocols.io connection. Dr. Kiermer was the founding editor of &lt;em&gt;Nature Methods&lt;/em&gt; and has a passion for reproducibility and a deep appreciation for the essential role that protocols play in the research cycle. We met at an Open Access mixer in San Francisco when she had just moved to PLOS. As I showed her what we had built, she asked countless questions of “can it do this and that” and I showed her the “yes” answers right on my phone. She got excited and said, “This is exactly what I always dreamed of. We should do something together!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has the COVID-19 pandemic taught you about the importance of Open Science and supporting collaborative research opportunities? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ve been stunned by the extent of rapid sharing and collaborative spirit in the research world, united against the COVID-19 pandemic. It is how you ideally imagine science working. It is how science should work. We’ve seen a remarkable level of rapid method sharing in the SARS-CoV-2 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/coronavirus-method-development-community/publications?sort=views&quot;&gt;group&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s not just the methods; researchers are sharing data, preprints, code in precisely the way that accelerates and amplifies everyone’s efforts around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am simultaneously inspired by what I see and frustrated that this isn’t yet the norm. I’ve been watching the world and publishers declare in 2015 that rapid sharing and immediate Open Access are essential for Ebola research. Then the same in 2016 for Zika. Then 2019 for all research related to the opioid crisis. In 2020 and 2021 it’s COVID-19. It’s frustrating that we make exceptions for pandemics and crises and then go back to the traditional stunted way of sharing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What type of research does not need to be as fast as possible? Do malaria or pediatric cancer patients somehow have the luxury of time? Can our planet afford delays in climate research? Open and rapid sharing as we see today for COVID-19 must be the norm, not an exception.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next for protocols.io? (How can you continue to help scientists adopt Open Science activities?) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The beautiful part of our growth (we have over 9,000 public protocols now and have been roughly doubling every year since our launch), is that with increased sharing and researchers on protocols.io we also have received more feedback and requests than ever. As more requests and suggestions come in, our appetite for improving and enhancing the platform only increases. It’s kind of like with research itself – each answer leads to more questions and more thirst for experiments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are also genuinely excited about the &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; Lab Protocols and we look forward to the first papers being published and to the future developments in this partnership. We’re just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bonus Question: How did you decide on the cute raccoon logo? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Mohammad Hassan Tayarani Najaran will talk about a paper &quot;How to Exploit Fitness Landscape Properties of Timetabling Problem: A New Operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fitness landscape of the timetabling problems is analyzed in this
paper to provide some insight into the properties of the problem. The
analyses suggest that the good solutions are clustered in the search
space and there is a correlation between the fitness of a local
optimum and its distance to the best solution. Inspired by these
findings, a new operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms is
proposed which, during the search process, collects information about
the fitness landscape and tried to capture the backbone structure of
the landscape. The knowledge it has collected is used to guide the
search process towards a better region in the search space. The
proposed algorithm consists of two phases. The first phase uses a tabu
mechanism to collect information about the fitness landscape. In the
second phase, the collected data are processed to guide the algorithm
towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm clusters the
good solutions it has found in its previous search process. Then when
the population is converged and trapped in a local optimum, it is
divided into sub-populations and each sub-population is designated to
a cluster. The information in the database is then used to
reinitialize the q-individuals, so they represent better regions in
the search space. This way the population maintains diversity and by
capturing the fitness landscape structure, the algorithm is guided
towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm is compared
with some state-of-the-art algorithms from PATAT competition
conferences and experimental results are presented.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/SoB1zL-x4PY/"/>
		<id>https://theplosblog.plos.org/?p=18747</id>
		<updated>2021-03-17T14:04:02+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;On February 17, 2021, FTI Consulting released the report: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publishers.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FTI-Report-for-Publishers-Association-1.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Economic assessment of the impact of the new Open Access policy developed by UK Research and Innovation&lt;/a&gt;” (full title) prepared for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publishers.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Publisher’s Association&lt;/a&gt; (PA) of the UK.  While we are not setting out to provide an extensive review and analysis of this report, we do want to generally refute the assertion that OA via the UKRI policy is economically damaging, and we’ll provide some references that support this position.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Open Access and Open Research are an opportunity&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The FTI/PA report asserts that the impact of the new UKRI policy could lead to a loss in revenue to “UK-based journals” and have a broader negative impact on UK competitiveness, economic growth and position as a “global research hub.” This assessment appears to use impact on traditional publication models as the basis for this conclusion. A problem here, however, is that it is considering the scholarly publishing industry as somehow separate from the broader economic impact of making research open. Previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publishers.org.uk/publications/publishings-contribution-to-research-and-innovation/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reports &lt;/a&gt;from the PA itself have shown that the link to the economy is much broader than this depiction. The UK’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-research-and-development-roadmap/uk-research-and-development-roadmap&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;R&amp;amp;D roadmap&lt;/a&gt; clearly embraces open research and rapid open dissemination as not just good for science and health (especially during the current pandemic) but as a core part of “a world-leading system that unlocks innovation and growth throughout all parts of the economy.” Open Access enables this entire ecosystem to operate more efficiently and cost-effectively. When coupled with Open Research, it brings the additional benefits of &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1913039116&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increasing trust in science&lt;/a&gt;, ever more important during these difficult times. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Open Research (of which Open Access is one part) offers even greater opportunity both in terms of discovery and economic growth. For example, the European Data Portal’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.europeandataportal.eu/sites/default/files/the-economic-impact-of-open-data.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report &lt;/a&gt;on the economic impact of open data identifies the potential for 15.7% growth across a range of sectors – including scientific &amp;amp; technical, communication, transport, finance, health, retail and agriculture – and significant cost savings across the economy. We believe that a focus on Open Research, and all the efficiencies it brings, is worth considering for the UK economy especially in light of the combined impacts of the pandemic and Brexit (whatever one’s position on Brexit is).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Open Access is the fastest growing publishing model. A recent report from the scholarly analytics firm, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dimensions.ai/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dimensions&lt;/a&gt;, shows that “in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dimensions.ai/blog/open-access-surpasses-subscription-publication-globally-for-the-first-time/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2020 […]more outputs were published through Open Access channels than traditional subscription channels globally&lt;/a&gt;.” The report further show that the majority of the growth in OA is fueled by Gold OA, i.e. OA supported by some kind of business or sustainability model. It is ever more futile, in our opinion, to take such a critical and isolated position against UKRI policy when one can argue that OA is an outcome that will simply continue to happen. It is far more beneficial, as the policy itself proposes, to establish the UK as an early adopter, leader, and beneficiary of OA and its opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Publishers can and should lead&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The benefits of OA, the opportunities created by OA, and the desire for OA by the public and funders like UKRI, are clear. Contrary to Section 4.44 of the report, which mischaracterizes PLOS as publishing “at cost”, it is entirely possible to maintain value for authors, funders, and  institutions while operating a sustainable, surplus-generating business model. PLOS believes that publishers globally should be leading the efforts to devise and develop the next generation of business models that are able to support their operations in an Open Access context. This will, of course, require deep, and sometimes difficult, work by transitioning publishers. But we strongly believe this work is not outside the acceptable effort level of conscientious members of the scholarly publishing industry that have been aware of Open Access, and its benefits, for at least the last 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank the UKRI for its efforts to hear from stakeholders in the scholarly  publishing community, and beyond, regarding the proposed policy. We understand it is a discussion rife with passionate viewpoints and unseen complexities, and so we would like to ensure that one point is clear: to successfully set up the most efficient,  frictionless Open Access ecosystem, we should leverage the &lt;em&gt;existing &lt;/em&gt;budgets and infrastructures of scholarly publishing but with OA as the outcome. This way, Open Access is not viewed as a destructive force, or something external and different that traditional publishers are not part of, but simply as the new way to publish and communicate research that all publishers can facilitate. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;–PLOS&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">
 &lt;p&gt;arXiv is updating its name change policy to provide registered authors with more control over their online identities. This approach, which reduces barriers to changing public records, fosters diversity and reflects our inclusive ethos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv now offers the following name change options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In full text works: the author name can be changed in the PDF and/or LaTeX source where it appears in the author list, acknowledgments, and email address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In metadata: the name and email address can be changed in the author list metadata and in the submission history metadata for all existing versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In user accounts: the name, username, and email address can all be changed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not currently able to support name changes in references and citations of works. Also, arXiv cannot make changes to other services, including third party search and discovery tools that may display author lists for papers on arXiv. arXiv will continue to evaluate and adapt its policies as best practices evolve, and to allow users to directly manage their identity, while maintaining discoverability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv began discussing this issue in 2018 at the request of arXiv community members. We then consulted with arXiv’s advisory boards, in addition to librarians, publishers, and diversity experts. This latest update is an outgrowth of this work and reflects arXiv’s support for name changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv’s new policy aligns with guiding principles recently provided by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://publicationethics.org/news/update-cope-guidance-regarding-author-name-changes&quot;&gt;Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)&lt;/a&gt;, a global organization that aims to integrate ethical practices as a normal part of the publishing culture worldwide. The group expects to release more complete guidance on the issue later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to request a name change, please contact us &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/support/general_help&quot;&gt;through our user support portal&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:help@arxiv.org&quot;&gt;help@arxiv.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/WKD-2021-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, 11 March 2021, &lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology&lt;/em&gt; is celebrating World Kidney Day. This awareness campaign started in 2006 as a joint effort of the &lt;em&gt;International Society of Nephrology&lt;/em&gt; and the I&lt;em&gt;nternational Federation of Kidney Foundations&lt;/em&gt; with the goal of increasing awareness of kidney disease worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Themes over the years have highlighted the impact of risk factors of diabetes and obesity and focus on transplantation, and the health of women and children. This year, the theme will be the year of “Living Well with Kidney Disease” with the goal of patient empowerment and life participation. This is a striking reset in priorities. There has been a tremendous focus on outcomes as measured by lab values and hospitalizations rates with reimbursements affected positively or negatively when not meeting targets. Protocol developments by insurers and hospital systems and guidelines have reinforced the emphasis on data. This year’s theme reframes the care of individuals with kidney disease as improving outcomes to allow them to continue to participate in their lives. The theme also emphasizes that meeting laboratory targets and following protocols do not equate to fully taking care of the patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life participation is not something easily measured and cannot really be determined without the input of the patient. For some, it will be the ability to work, to participate in family activities, to vacation, or to control their symptoms. It puts patients and their caregivers at the center of their treatment plan and setting the goals of their care. To deliver this, healthcare providers will need to provide the education and support to empower patients and caregivers to be able to have a more active role and have discussions about what is important to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s World Kidney Day theme is a good reminder to all health providers that we are taking care of the individual not just treating a disease process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s World Kidney Day theme is a good reminder to all health providers that we are taking care of the individual not just treating a disease process. Hearing our patient’s concerns, challenges, and what they value should be part of our routine. Kidney disease for many is a life-changing diagnosis. While we cannot change the diagnosis of kidney disease, addressing the anxiety and frustrations many patients have will help their overall care. The initiative of living well with kidney disease serves to remind nephrology providers that kidney disease is part of the patient’s life but should not be their entire life.  I would take this further that this may be a reminder for all of us taking care of individuals with a variety of health conditions. We need to take care of the individual, not just the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Author: Chris Haumesser, Director of Platform and Engineering at PLOS&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding the impact of research is of vital importance to science. The altmetrics  movement is &lt;a href=&quot;http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;defined&lt;/a&gt; by its belief that research impact is best measured by diverse real time data about how a research artifact is being used and discussed. These metrics serve as “alternatives” to solely relying  on traditional shorthand assessments like citation counts and Journal Impact Factor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PLOS was an early adopter and advocate of these metrics, with its internally-developed Article Level Metrics (ALM) platform among the earliest implementations to launch in 2009. By displaying data from multiple sources, PLOS ALM showed how an article was being read, downloaded, cited, discussed and shared, accessible from the article itself by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In its decade of service to the PLOS community, ALM has helped blaze a trail for others to follow. Today altmetrics are so commonly taken for granted that the “alternative” moniker seems anachronistic – the ubiquity of these metrics a testament to the return on our investment in ALM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, the altmetrics movement has been so successful that it has spawned a market of providers who specialize in collecting and curating metrics and metadata about how research outputs are used and discussed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of these services, in particular, has far outpaced the reach and capabilities of ALM, and PLOS is now excited to pass the baton of our altmetrics operations to the experts at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altmetric.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Altmetric&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the historical significance of ALM, it’s not an easy decision to say goodbye. But PLOS is as committed as ever to providing our community with the best possible data about how their research is changing the world. Altmetric’s singular focus on research metrics positions them to deliver on this promise with a breadth and depth that PLOS simply can’t match as an organization with competing priorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Partnering with Altmetric will unlock data from many sources beyond ALM that were previously untracked. After an extensive analysis, PLOS is confident that Altmetric will provide increased coverage across the board for the vast majority of papers in our corpus. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beginning today, the data displayed on the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/metrics?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223447&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Metrics&lt;/a&gt;” tab of our published articles will all come from Altmetric, and the “Media Coverage” tab of our published articles will link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.altmetric.com/details/67678982/news&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Altmetric’s media coverage&lt;/a&gt;. Each article will also have a link to an Altmetric &lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.altmetric.com/details/67678982&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;details page&lt;/a&gt;, which displays extensive detailed metrics for the article. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As part of this transition, authors may see their metrics change due to the change in data provider. We expect authors to see some metrics increase due to Altmetric’s increased coverage and new sources. However, we are retiring some areas of our metrics provision entirely. Unfortunately, our articles will no longer display PMC usage counts, as these were aggregated by ALM and will no longer be available. We will also be removing recent tweets from articles and retiring the ALM Reports service.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moving forward we will continue to evaluate the presentation of metrics on our articles and look for ways to integrate even more relevant data from Altmetric into our user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
