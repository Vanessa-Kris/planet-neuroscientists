 When journals retract a paper but don’t explain why, what should readers think? Was the problem as simple as an administrative error by the publisher, or more concerning, like fraud? In a recent paper in Research Policy, economists led by Adam Cox at the University of Portsmouth, UK, analyzed 55 retractions from hundreds of economics … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/28/why-detailed-retraction-notices-are-important-according-to-economists/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Why detailed retraction notices are important (according to economists)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Does power posing –  such as standing with your hands on your hips and your feet spaced well apart – really help to improve your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yes&lt;/i&gt; – according to Amy Cuddy, one of the pioneers of the idea, at Harvard University (famous for her massively popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc&quot;&gt;TED talk&lt;/a&gt; on the subject and her best-selling book &lt;i&gt;Presence&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;i&gt;No&lt;/i&gt; – according to a critical analysis by Joseph Simmons and Uri Simonsohn at the University of Pennsylvania, &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2791272&quot;&gt;published in Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. The pair’s statistical analysis of 33 previous studies of potential posture effects led them to a damning conclusion: “the existing evidence is too weak to… advocate for people to engage in power posing to better their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now Cuddy, and colleagues, are back, with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/CzbNAn7Ch6ZZirK9yMGH/full&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; also published in &lt;i&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/i&gt;. While Cuddy appears to be softening her claims about what power-posing can achieve, she and her colleagues argue that their new analysis shows that there is strong evidence that posture affects emotions in particular, and that power-posing &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; likely to have a meaningful impact on people, and should not be discounted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33561&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new paper involves the same type of statistical analysis (called a p-curve analysis) adopted by Simmons and Simonsohn, which uses the distribution of “p values” to estimate the likelihood of falsely positive results in a given set of studies. But whereas Simmons and Simonsohn used this technique to analyse 33 published studies that Cuddy and others had highlighted in a 2015 paper, the new analysis was performed on every single peer-reviewed study in the field that Cuddy and her colleagues could find. This literature search added 21 studies to the total. In the new analysis, the researchers also looked specifically at potential effects of posture on feelings of power, which Simmons and Simonsohn did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new analysis provides clear evidence, Cuddy’s team argue, that people who adopt open, expansive, “power” poses do &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; more powerful. And “feeling powerful is an intrinsically consequential, theoretically important, fundamental outcome,” they write. “We believe that even transient feelings of power can have long-lasting consequences for people’s lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say their new work also provides “very strong” evidence that expansive vs. contractive (such as self-hugging) postures have other emotion-related effects, including affecting participants’ recall of positive vs. negative memories, their self-evaluations, their specific emotional state, and their ability to recover from a negative mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about impacts of power posing on actual behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claims that power posing can change the way people behave – affecting their willingness to take risks or how they perform in a job interview, for example – are not supported by the new analysis, nor for that matter were they supported by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23743603.2017.1342447&quot;&gt;recent series of papers&lt;/a&gt; that failed to replicate previous work that had found power posing alters behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Cuddy and her colleagues argue that “there is a need for experimental tests of incremental or longitudinal effects of adopting expansive postures over time on various outcomes,” adding that “Right now, we are not aware of any such research”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas about what power-posing can, and can’t, do are clearly being refined. And will no doubt continue to be refined, as more studies are published – something that this new work perhaps makes more likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their 2017 paper, Simmons and Simonsohn questioned the justification for spending “valuable resources” on research into power posing. In the conclusion to the new paper, Cuddy and her co-authors write: “Our findings…should encourage researchers who are investigating this area to continue to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;

No problem. We just made it easier to use your phone to find and scan PLOS articles.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re someone who’s out in the field more than in the lab, you may have been challenged finding research on the fly. That’s now in the past. To expedite discovery and access to PLOS research articles, we’ve worked with Google Scholar to include PLOS abstracts in their new Quick Abstracts feature. Researchers around the world can now view complete abstracts and explore citations quickly and efficiently from any mobile device. For scientists, educators, policy makers and journalists, this means more efficient and timely access to the academic literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How It Works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Scholar &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.googleblog.com/2018/03/quickly-flip-through-papers-on-your.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick Abstracts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; allows researchers to tap on any search result to browse the full abstract text of a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/publications&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; directly on their cell phone, then either return to the search results or swipe right and left to read additional abstracts. From a link at the bottom of the abstract text, readers are taken directly to the complete article. Quick Abstracts even serves up preprint abstracts from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, further extending discoverability of work by authors who opt to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/02/plos-cold-spring-harbor-preprint-agreement-biorxiv/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;post their preprints&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; at time of submission to PLOS journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick Abstracts includes all the expected features of Google Scholar, including saving to “My Library” through the star button, and display of citing and related articles. Additionally, an entire discovery network is available through use of search strings on the Google Scholar homepage. For example, entering “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;amp;q=site%3Ajournals.plos.org&amp;amp;btnG=&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;site:journals.plos.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” in the search bar retrieves abstracts of the entire database of PLOS research articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation for All&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research, discovery and knowledge on the go shouldn’t be restricted to technology-driven economies. While the majority of cell phone users in the United States and Europe benefit from 3G, and even 4G, technologies and fast data delivery speeds on their mobile devices, this is not the case &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://opensignal.com/reports/2016/08/global-state-of-the-mobile-network&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;globally&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Quick Abstracts integrates mobile network optimization that enables abstract display without delay, especially important for communities in the global south browsing and reading journals such as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and related research in additional PLOS journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open. Fast. Global.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adoption of Quick Abstracts is a logical extension of our ongoing relationship with Google Scholar—one based on making research more open and available throughout the global scholarly research community. Our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CC BY licensing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/open-access&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open Access ethos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and mobile-ready delivery of journal content enables innovators like Google Scholar to bring their latest technologies to PLOS, for the benefit of our authors and the wider scientific community. Like our partnership with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocols.io/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;protocols.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/04/protocols-io-tools-for-reproducibility/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;laboratory methods citations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and collaboration with bioRxiv for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/02/plos-cold-spring-harbor-preprint-agreement-biorxiv/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;preprints with our journal submissions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, this is just one more example of how we’re working with external collaborators to transform research communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;No more waiting to get back to your desk, lab or laptop to explore a potential new project, prepare for journal club or add to your reference list—head to scholar.google.com from your cell phone for abstract display without delay.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With suicide among &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-36378573&quot;&gt;university students on the increase in England and Wales&lt;/a&gt;, there’s an urgent need to find better ways to support those students who are experiencing distress. Many campuses have provisions in place, such as student counselling services, but students often prefer to turn to their peers in times of need. This raises the possibility that students themselves are best placed to sound the alarm if and when one of their friends is going through a crisis. A new study from the US – where there are similar concerns about student mental health issues – has investigated how well college roommates are able to recognise each other’s levels of emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217754192&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, highlight the challenge of requiring students to look out for each other – generally, students who shared a room underestimated each other’s distress levels. And while students who were identified by their roommates as being very distressed were indeed more likely to actually be very distressed, many of them were not, which demonstrates the problem of false alarms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33554&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qi Xu and Patrick Shrout at New York University recruited 187 same-sex pairs of students who shared a room together at college and had done so for at least five months (85 per cent of the pairs were female and just over half were White). In February and then again in April, the students rated how much over the previous six weeks they had experienced various emotions indicative of distress, such as hopelessness, and how much they thought their roommate had experienced the same emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the students underestimated each other’s distress. Gender and relationship closeness between roommates made no difference. The students were swayed to an extent by their own distress levels, such that they had a bias to see their roommate as less distressed than they were themselves (this is consistent with &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/01/24/other-people-may-experience-more-misery-than-you-realise/&quot;&gt;prior research&lt;/a&gt; that’s found we generally tend to assume other people are happier than they are).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of the size of the students’ mis-measure of each other’s distress, on average for each unit increase in self-reported distress reported by one roommate, their room buddy tended to estimate that their distress had only increased by 0.26 units (and that’s even after accounting for the bias caused by any changes in the estimating student’s own distress).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the ability of students to spot specifically if their roommate had been experiencing a significant level of distress? The researchers estimated that nearly 20 per cent of their sample had a score indicative of moderate or severe distress. If a participant thought their roommate was significantly distressed then that student’s risk of actually being so was double the average rate (that is, around 40 per cent of students rated as significantly distressed by their roommate actually were significantly distressed based on their self-ratings). The problem is, this still means that the majority – 60 per cent – of students rated as significantly distressed by a roommate were not actually very distressed. In other words, if college authorities followed up every time that a student reported their roommate to be significantly distressed, there would be a lot of false alarms, meaning wasted resources, at least some awkwardness, perhaps even resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xu and Shrout said their results “underscore the need to consider peer reports as a screening tool rather than a precise source of information”. They added that “more universal training on how to identify and respond to the distress of peers might have the benefit of encouraging conversations among roommates about what actions each might take if he or she noticed another experiencing extreme distress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217754192&quot;&gt;Accuracy and Bias in Perception of Distress Level and Distress Change Among Same-Sex College Student Roommate Dyads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/Toxicology-Research-Laboratory-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;2017 was an exciting year for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpharmacoltoxicol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. We continued to publish some of the most exciting research related to a range of pharmacological and toxicological topics. Throughout the year we published articles on models predicting drug-drug interactions, potential drugs to suppress tumor growth and toxins which adversely impact physiological functioning.  Below are three articles from 2017 that we believe deserve extra attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computational modeling can predict adverse drug reactions induced by drug interactions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medications can cause several adverse drug reactions (ADRs). However, when more than one medication is taken at a time ADRs can increase due to drug-drug interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more than 800 drugs on the market, and it is incredibly difficult to track whether there are drug-drug interaction ADRs for specific drug combinations since they either do not exist, have not been reported, or the drug combination has not been taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are more than 800 drugs on the market, and it is incredibly difficult to track whether there are drug-drug interaction ADRs for specific drug combinations since they either do not exist, have not been reported, or the drug combination has not been taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of these challenges, a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpharmacoltoxicol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40360-017-0153-6&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Liu et al. used computational modeling to determine the number and severity of drug-drug interaction ADRs without having to track human patients. For this computational model, the authors utilized the STITCH database, which tracks drug-protein interaction profiles, and TWOSIDES, which tracks ADRs caused by synergistic drug-drug interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis of these databases allowed for the identification of what types of drugs had high and low rates of drug-drug interaction ADRs. Drug classes such as cardiovascular drugs and musculoskeletal drugs were associated with the highest numbers of drug-drug interaction ADRs while antineoplastics (anti-tumor drugs) and immunomodulators were associated with the lowest rates of drug-drug interaction ADRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modeling process also allowed for the calculation of the rates of drug-drug interaction ADRs between two classes of drugs. For example, combining antifungals and proton-pump inhibitors can result in high rates of ADRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the modeling predicted the rate of ADRs when combining a drug of one class with drugs of another class.  For example, the anti-infectious agent, norfloxacin, had a low adverse drug-drug interaction score when taken with anti-convulsants while a different anti-infectious agent, Nafcillin, had a high adverse drug-drug interaction score when taken with an anti-convulsant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the myriad of drugs on the market, this study provides important information for the safety and efficacy of drug prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposure to the antimicrobial, triclosan, can decrease the resilience of the mouse gut microbiome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10065&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Triclosan products&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10065&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/Triclosan-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Substances containing triclosan&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;flickr.com&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synergistic relationship between microbiota and an animal is critical for the animal’s health with alterations in the gut potentially leading to health issues. The microbiota can change in response to factors including diet, pesticides and metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triclosan is an antimicrobial that is extensively used in medical and household products such as soaps, cleaning products, and even toothpastes. Worryingly, growing evidence is showing that triclosan may have a negative impact on the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpharmacoltoxicol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40360-017-0150-9&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology &lt;/em&gt;tested whether triclosan does disrupt the gut microbiome, mice were exposed to water with triclosan or plain water to act as a control. Researchers performed 16s rRNA sequencing to identify the type and number of gut bacteria species during 13 weeks of triclosan exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16S rRNA refers to a specific part of bacteria ribosomal RNA that allows for bacterial species identification. The researchers found that triclosan had a significant impact on both the composition and function of the gut microbiome in the mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of particular importance was the increase in certain bacterial genes which indicated that chronic triclosan exposure was leading to antibacterial resistance. While certain antibacterial resistant genes increased, other gut bacteria decreased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This combined change in gut bacteria can have detrimental effects for two reasons. First, an increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria can result in a decrease in antibiotic efficacy.  Second, a variety of gut bacterial species is important because greater species richness can attenuate any disruptions to the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study therefore demonstrates that triclosan can have potential detrimental effects on gut microbiota and repercussions on an animal’s health. More research needs to be done to determine if and what kind of health effects occur as well as whether these findings can be extrapolated to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methylxanthines alter the structure and function of the cardiac system in zebrafish embryos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methylxanthines are one of the most commonly ingested substances in the world. They are found in regularly consumed beverages, such as coffee, and are also used medicinally to treat ailments such as asthma, peripheral vascular disease, and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data show that a single early exposure of methylxanthines can have toxic effects on body morphology, cardiovascular structures, and cardiovascular functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that methylxanthines can be toxic and that this toxicity can start as early as gestation.  The authors of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpharmacoltoxicol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40360-017-0179-9&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; examined the potential toxic effects on the developing cardiovascular system by using zebrafish, which show a surprisingly similar response to cardiotoxins as mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the cardiotoxic effects of methylxanthines, four different doses of eight different methylxanthines were&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;injected into recently fertilized zebrafish eggs, and the effects of methylxanthines on embryo morphology and cardiovascular structure and functioning were observed at 48 and 72 hours after fertilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highest doses of caffeine, IBMX and pentoxifylline (used for pain in peripheral artery disease) showed the greatest percent of morphological defects in embryos. Cardiovascular structural alterations occurred in 20-40% of embryos when exposed to the highest dose of methylxanthines except for diprophylline and etophylline, two drugs used to treat respiratory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10066&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10066&quot; height=&quot;192&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/Zebrafish-embryo-morphology-300x192.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Zebrafish embryo morphology&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five of the methylxanthines also increased heart rate in normal looking embryos at 48 hours after fertilization but returned to normal 24 hours after this. These data show that a single early exposure of methylxanthines can have toxic effects on body morphology, cardiovascular structures, and cardiovascular functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research is required to examine whether these effects can translate to higher order species especially to placental mammals since the complex mother-placenta-fetus relationship may prevent certain drugs from passing from the mother to the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/Fotolia_85982322_Subscription_Yearly_XXL-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;2016 saw, for the third consecutive year, the highest number of drug related deaths ever recorded in Scotland. In that year, 867 people lost their lives to drugs. This amounts to a 23% rise on 2015, and more than double the number of deaths of ten years ago (421 in 2006). Rates have continued to rise since the 1990s and they continue to contribute to Scotland’s higher mortality rates overall, relative to the rest of Western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 1980s, less and less of this higher mortality could be explained by association with deprivation alone. It has been proposed that this could be because the social, economic and political contexts of the 1980s created a delayed negative health impact. Indeed, we have found this to be the case for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jech.bmj.com/content/jech/early/2016/07/18/jech-2016-207296.full.pdf&quot;&gt;trends in suicide in Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, which also rose in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those born between around 1960 and 1980 did experience a higher risk of drug-related deaths since the 1990s, and the group at highest risk were males living in the most deprived areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Drugs-and-Alcohol-Misuse/Publications/2014-10-28/2014-10-28-Drug-Prevalence-Report.pdf&quot;&gt;the evidence&lt;/a&gt; that problem drug use is related to social circumstances, with job loss, poverty, Adverse Childhood Experiences and trauma all being factors. We therefore set out to determine whether Scotland’s trend in drug-related deaths could be explained by a group of people who were young adults of working age in Scotland and had been exposed to the changing social, economic and political contexts of the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-5267-2&quot;&gt;Our research, published today in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that this is likely to be the case. Those born between around 1960 and 1980 did experience a higher risk of drug-related deaths since the 1990s (when they were working age), and the group at highest risk were males living in the most deprived areas. The impact of this effect can be seen over the years as this group of people get older, carrying their greater risk of drug-related death with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that the combination of social and economic policies that lead to a rapid rise in income inequality, an increase in unemployment, inadequate housing, poor employment conditions and a negative social context, have serious consequences for health and could account for the higher risk of drug related deaths in this generation of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting this group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what of the people who were subject to these past policies, who are older now, and who carry an increased risk of drug-related death? It is paramount that they have available to them additional support to take account of the impact that these circumstances have had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full impact of the excess mortality in the generation with high drug-related deaths is unlikely to be known for some time. But we know it already represents the deaths of hundreds of people prematurely; half of the current estimated population of 61,500 people in Scotland with drug problems is over 35 years old (considered to be older drug users) and older drug users accounted for almost three quarters (71%) of drug–related deaths in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this group of people continues to age, drugs services will need to adapt to their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this group of people continues to age, drugs services will need to adapt to their needs as co-morbidities from chronic conditions associated with ageing and drug use become more prevalent. It is estimated, for example, that prolonged problematic drug use adds about 15 years’ additional physiological health damage. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sdf.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Working-group-report-OPDPs-in-2017.pdf&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; also found that older people with drug problems report experiencing stigma, loneliness and isolation. These act as barriers to seeking support and accessing services, preventing individuals from addressing the harms they experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a need to specifically tailor or adapt, as well as design services to meet the distinct medical, psychological, and social needs such as housing, social security and support services, of this group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean for current drugs policy for Scotland? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, we should learn from the past and inform current and future policy to help prevent a further generation being at greater risk of drug-related deaths in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem drug use disproportionately affects people who experience socio-economic disadvantage. It is clear that social and economic policy has the potential to either improve, or harm health. On that basis, NHS Health Scotland believes that policy to reduce harm from drug use must take account of the wider things that impact on our health, like housing, work, income and social connectedness – the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.healthscotland.scot/health-inequalities/the-right-to-health&quot;&gt;social determinants of health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an approach that puts improving health and reducing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.healthscotland.scot/health-inequalities/what-are-health-inequalities&quot;&gt;health inequalities&lt;/a&gt; first, takes a non-punitive harm reduction approach to recovery, offers low-threshold services, tackles associated stigma and responds to individual need as well as addressing broader socio-economic circumstances that increase individuals’ vulnerability to problem drug use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing these wider social inequalities, and reducing poverty, will help play an important role in the prevention of drug misuse and a reduction in associated harms. As the research shows, for many who were exposed to social policy that did not do this, it’s too late for prevention. But what it also shows is that we can take action to reduce harm and prevent more deaths in this group, as well as taking action to ensure the social and economic policies of the future improve health and reduce health inequalities to prevent a repeat of the impact on the generation of the 1980s playing out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is a structure found on both sides of the brain in the temporal lobes, near the ears. It plays an important role in memory and thinking about the past and future. This led a team of researchers, led by Cornelia McCormick at the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, to wonder if people with damage to both hippocampi are still capable of mind-wandering – after all, when we mind wander or day-dream, a lot of the time it is about things we’ve done or plan to do. And if these patients can mind wander, will the content of their mind-wandering thoughts be different from healthy controls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/11/2745&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers shadowed 6 male patients with bilateral hippocampus damage for two days during daylight hours, occasionally prompting them to report what they were thinking about, and compared their descriptions with those obtained from 12 age-matched healthy controls over the same period. The patients with hippocampus damage mind-wandered just as much as the controls, but the form and content of their mind-wandering was very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33536&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers followed the patients (who had small but highly specific lesions to the hippocampus, caused by a form of encephalitis) and controls while they were attending a psych lab for two days of brain scans and other tests. Twenty times during these eight-hour days, the researchers prompted the participants with the question: “What were you thinking about just before I asked you?”. They timed these prompts deliberately during quiet periods when mind-wandering might be especially likely, and immediately transcribed the participants’ answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding the answers, the researchers found extremely high rates of mind-wandering – defined as having thoughts disengaged from the outside world (or perceptually “decoupled”) – among both patients and controls, of around 80 to 90 per cent. The high rates of mind-wandering are not such a surprise, at least among the controls, because of the way the researchers had timed their prompts. For comparison, past research suggests that we mind-wander about 30 to 50 per cent of our waking lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the patients’ mind-wandering thoughts were very different from the healthy controls’. Whereas the controls’ mind-wandering was mostly episodic (about events past and present) and consisted of visual scenes, the patients’ mind-wandering was largely semantic (about facts) and verbal. “Small, selective lesions of their hippocampus dramatically affected the nature of their mind-wandering,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This contrast in mind-wandering between patients and controls is in the context that on neuropsychological testing the hippocampus patients had impaired episodic memory, but performed normally in all other ways, including on tests of working memory, so it is highly unlikely they were simply unable to recall their mind-wandering thoughts. They also had no trouble recalling the nature of two other experiments they took part in, which covered similar time-scales to the mind-wandering research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know from research with healthy people that mind-wandering depends on activity in a network of brain regions known as the “default mode network”, which includes the hippocampus. Also, people who report particularly rich and detailed mental time travel during mind-wandering tend to have stronger connectivity between their hippocampi and other key regions of the default mode network. However, this new study is the first to suggest strongly that an intact hippocampus is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for “normal” mind-wandering involving mental time travel and vivid visual scenes. The results also complement other research showing that hippocampus patients struggle to imagine the past and future when prompted to do so, revealing that this impairment extends to the content of their spontaneous thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By showing [that the hippocampus] plays a causal role in a phenomenon as ubiquitous as mind-wandering, this exposes the impact of the hippocampus beyond its traditionally perceived role in episodic memory, placing it at the centre or our everyday mental experiences,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/11/2745&quot;&gt;Mind-Wandering in People with Hippocampal Damage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h4&gt;The rough guide to doing data science on neurons&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/301/1*NbxhK8wR5DfWtFtK0pHdgA.png&quot; /&gt;A brain doing data science. Credit: Brain by Matt Wasser from the Noun Project&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quietly, stealthily, a new type of neuroscientist is taking shape. From within the myriad ranks of theorists have risen teams of neuroscientists that do science with data on neural activity, on the sparse splutterings of hundreds of neurons. Not the creation of methods for analysing data, though all do that too. Not the gathering of that data, for that requires another, formidable, skill set. But neuroscientists using the full gamut of modern computational techniques on that data to answer scientific questions about the brain. A neural data science has emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out I’m one of them, this clan of neural data scientists. Accidentally. As far as I can tell, that’s how all scientific fields are born: accidentally. Researchers follow their noses, start doing new things, and suddenly find there’s a small crowd of them in the kitchen at parties (because it’s where the drinks are, in the fridge — scientists are smart). So here’s a little manifesto for neural data science: why it’s emerging, and how we might set about doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The why is the same as all areas of science that have spat out a data science: the amount of data is getting out of hand. For the science of recording lots of neurons, this data deluge has a scientific rationale, of sorts. Brains work by passing messages between neurons. Most of those messages take the form of tiny pulses of electricity: spikes, we call them. So to many it seems logical that if we want to understand how brains work (and when they don’t work) we need to capture all the messages being passed between all the neurons. And that means recording as many spikes from as many neurons as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A baby zebrafish brain has about 80,000 neurons, and at least 1 million connections between them; a bumblebee brain has about one million neurons. You can see how this would get out of hand very quickly. Right now we record somewhere between tens to a few hundred neurons at the same time with standard kit. At the limits are people recording a few thousand, and even a few getting tens of thousands (albeit these recordings capture neuron activity at rates much slower than the neurons could be sending their spikes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We call this madness systems neuroscience: neuroscience, for the study of neurons; systems, for daring to record from more than one neuron at a time. And the data are mind-bendingly complex. What we have are tens to thousands of simultaneously recorded time-series, each the stream of spiking events (actual spikes, or some indirect measure thereof) from one neuron. By definition, they are not stationary, their statistics change over time. Their rates of activity spread over many orders of magnitude, from monk-like quiet contemplation to “drum kit in a wind tunnel”. And their patterns of activity range from clock-like regularity, to stuttering and spluttering, to alternating between bouts of mania and bouts of exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now marry that to the behaviour of the animal you’ve recorded the neurons from. This behaviour is hundreds of trials of choices; or arm movements; or routes taken through an environment. Or the movement of a sense organ, or the entire posture of the musculature. Repeat for multiple animals. Possibly multiple brain regions. And sometimes whole brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have no ground-truth. There isn’t a right answer; there are no training labels for the data, except the behaviour. We don’t know how brains encode behaviour. So we can do things with behavioural labels, but we almost always know these are not the answer. They are just clues to the “answer”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systems neuroscience is then a rich playground for those who can marry their knowledge of neuroscience to their know-how for analysing data. A neural data science is being born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How is it — or could it be — done? Here’s a rough guide. The raison d’etre of the neural data scientist is to ask scientific questions of data from systems neuroscience; to ask: how do all these neurons work together to do their thing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are roughly three ways we can answer that question. We can see these three ways by looking at the correspondence between established classes of problems in machine learning and computational challenges in systems neuroscience. Let’s start by looking at what we have to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have some data from &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; neurons that we’ve collected over time. We’ll lump these into a matrix we’ll call &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; — as many columns as neurons, and as many rows as time-points we’ve recorded (where it’s up to us how long a “time-point” lasts: we might make it short, and just have each entry record a 1 for a spike, and 0 otherwise. Or we might make it long, and each entry records the number of spikes during that elapsed time). Over that time, stuff has been happening in the world — including what the body has been doing. So let’s lump all that into a matrix we’ll call &lt;em&gt;S &lt;/em&gt;— as many columns as there are features in the world we care about, and as many rows as time-points we’ve recorded for those features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, machine learning involves building three classes of models about the state of the world and the available data: generative, discriminative, and density. As a rough guide, this table shows how each class corresponds to a fundamental question in systems neuroscience:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iE5yc6dFw3Kb769QTiUVBw.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1/ Density models &lt;em&gt;P(X)&lt;/em&gt;: is there structure in the spikes? &lt;/strong&gt;Sounds dull. But actually this is key to great swathes of neuroscience research, in which we want to know the effect of something (a drug, a behaviour, a sleep) on the brain; in which we are asking: how has the structure of neural activity changed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a recording of a bunch of neurons, we can answer this in three ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we can quantify the spike-train of each neuron, by measuring the statistics of each column of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, like the rate of spiking. And then ask: what is the model &lt;em&gt;P(X) &lt;/em&gt;for these statistics? We can cluster these statistics to find “types” of neuron; or simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301008212001505?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;fit models to their entire joint distribution&lt;/a&gt;. Either way, we have some model of the data structure at the granularity of single neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, we can create generative models of the entire population’s activity, using the rows of &lt;em&gt;X — &lt;/em&gt;the vectors of the moment-to-moment activity of the whole population. Such models typically aim to understand how much of the structure of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; can be recreated from just a few constraints, whether they be the distribution of how many vectors have how many spikes; or the pairwise correlations between neurons; or combinations thereof. These are particularly useful for working out if there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/28783140/&quot;&gt;any special sauce&lt;/a&gt; in the population’s activity, if it is anything more than the collective activity of a set of independent or boringly simple neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, we can take the position that the neural activity in &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is some high dimensional realisation of a low dimensional space, where the number of dimensions &lt;em&gt;D &amp;lt;&amp;lt; n.&lt;/em&gt; Typically we mean by this: some neurons in &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; are correlated, so we don’t need to use the whole of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; to understand the population — instead we can replace them with a much simpler representation. We might cluster the time-series directly, so decomposing &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; into a set of &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; smaller matrices &lt;em&gt;X_1&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;X_N&lt;/em&gt;, each of which has (relatively) strong correlations within it, and so can be treated independently. Or we might use some kind of dimension reduction approach like Principal Components Analysis, to get a small set of time-series that each describes one dominant form of variation in the population’s activity over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can do more than this. The above assumes we want to use dimension reduction to collapse neurons — that we apply reduction to the columns of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;. But we could just as easily collapse time, by applying dimension reduction to the rows of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;. Rather than asking if neural activity is redundant, this is asking if different moments in time have similar patterns of neural activity. If there are only a handful of these, clearly the dynamics of the recorded neurons are very simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can throw in dynamical systems approaches here too. Here we try to fit simple models to the changes in &lt;em&gt;X &lt;/em&gt;over time (i.e. mapping from one row to the next), and use those models to quantify the types of dynamics &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; contains — using terms like “attractor”, “separatrix”, “saddle node”, “pitchfork bifurcation”, and “the Arsenal collapse” (only one of those is not a real thing). One might plausibly argue the dynamical models so fitted are all density models &lt;em&gt;P(X)&lt;/em&gt;, as they describe the structure of the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hell, we could even try and fit an entire dynamical model of a neural circuit, a bunch of differential equations describing each neuron, to &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, so that our model &lt;em&gt;P(X)&lt;/em&gt; is then sampled every time we run the model from different initial conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these density models, we can fit them separately to the neural activity we recorded in a bunch of different states (&lt;em&gt;S1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;S2&lt;/em&gt;,…, &lt;em&gt;Sm&lt;/em&gt;), and answer questions like: how does the structure of a population of neurons change between sleeping and waking? Or during development of the animal? Or in the course of learning a task (where &lt;em&gt;S1&lt;/em&gt; might be trial 1, and &lt;em&gt;S2&lt;/em&gt; trial 2; or &lt;em&gt;S1&lt;/em&gt; is session 1 and &lt;em&gt;S2&lt;/em&gt; session 2; or many combinations thereof). We can also ask: how many dimensions does neuron activity span? Are the dimensions different between different regions of cortex? And has anyone seen my keys?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2/ Generative models P(X|S): what causes a spike?&lt;/strong&gt; Now we’re talking. Things like linear-nonlinear models, or generalised linear models. Typically these models are applied to single neurons, to each column of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;. With them we are fitting a model that uses the state of the world &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; as input, and spits out a neural activity series that matches the neuron’s activity as closely as possible. By then inspecting the weighting given to each feature of &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; in reproducing the neuron’s activity, we can work out what that neuron appears to give a damn about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We might want to chose a model that has some flexibility in what counts as “the state of the world”. We can include the neuron’s own past activity as a feature, and see if it cares about what it did in the past. For some types of neuron, the answer is yes. Bursting can take a lot out of a neuron, and it needs to lie down for a wee rest before it can go again. We can also think more broadly, and include the rest of the population — the rest of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; — as part of the state of the world &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; while the neuron is firing. After all, neurons occasionally influence each others’ firing, or so I’m led to believe. So there is a tiny chance that the response of a neuron in visual cortex is not &lt;strong&gt;just&lt;/strong&gt; driven by the orientation of an edge in the outside world, but may also depend on what the 10000 cortical neurons connecting to it are also doing. What we then learn is the approximately most influential neurons in the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t have to apply these generative models to single neurons. We can equally apply them to our density models; we can ask what each cluster, or dimension, is encoding about the world. Or, &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/27342&quot;&gt;as some people did here&lt;/a&gt;, we can use the density model itself as the state of the world, and ask what features of that model downstream neurons give a damn about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The types of questions we can answer with these generative models are pretty obvious: what combination of features best predict a neuron’s response? Are there neurons selective for just one thing? How do neurons influence each other?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/ Discriminative models &lt;em&gt;P(S|X)&lt;/em&gt;: what information do spikes carry?&lt;/strong&gt; This is a core question in systems neuroscience as it is the challenge faced by all neurons that are downstream from our recorded population — all neurons that receive inputs from the neurons we recorded from and stuffed in our matrix &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;. For those downstream neurons must infer what they need to know about the external world based solely on spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we can use standard classifiers, that map inputs onto labelled outputs. We can use the rows of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; as input, each a snapshot of the population’s activity, and attempt to predict one, some, or all of the features in the corresponding rows of &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;. Possibly with some time delay, so we use row &lt;em&gt;X_t&lt;/em&gt; to predict the state &lt;em&gt;S_t-n &lt;/em&gt;that was &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; steps in the past if we’re interested in how populations code states that are input to the brain; or we can use row &lt;em&gt;X_t&lt;/em&gt; to predict the state &lt;em&gt;S_t+n &lt;/em&gt;that is &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; steps in the future if we’re interested in how populations code for some effect of the brain on the world. Like the activity in motor cortex that is happening before I type each letter right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, we take some (but not all, for we do not overfit) rows of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, and train the classifier to find the best possible mapping of &lt;em&gt;X &lt;/em&gt;to the corresponding chunk of &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;. Then we test the classifier on how well it can predict the rest of &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; from the corresponding rest of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re extraordinarily lucky, your &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; could be so long that you’re able to divide them into train, test, and validate sets. Keep the last in a locked box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We could of course use as powerful a classifier as we like. From logistic regression, through Bayesian approaches, to using a 23 layer neural network. It rather depends on what you want out of the answer, and the trade-off between interpretability and power you’re comfortable with. My writings elsewhere have made it plain which side of this trade-off I tend to favour. But I’m happy to be proved wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encoding models of neurons are insightful, but touch on some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/31/168237&quot;&gt;old and deep philosophical quandaries&lt;/a&gt;. Testing encoding using a discriminative model assumes that something downstream is trying to decode &lt;em&gt;S &lt;/em&gt;from neural activity. There are two problems with this. Neurons do not decode; neurons take in spikes as input and output their own spikes. Rather, they &lt;strong&gt;re-code&lt;/strong&gt;, from one set of spikes into another set of spikes: perhaps fewer, or slower; perhaps more, or faster; perhaps from a steady stream into an oscillation. So discriminative models are more accurately asking what information our neurons are re-coding. But even if we take this view, there’s a deeper problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With very few exceptions, there is no such thing as a “downstream” neuron. The neurons we recorded in &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; are part of the intricately wired brain, full of endless loops; their output affects their own input. Worse, some of the neurons in &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; are downstream from the others: some of them input directly to the others. Because, as noted above, neurons influence each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rough, perhaps useful, manifesto for a neural data science. It is incomplete; no doubt something above is wrong (answers on a postcard to the usual address). The above is an attempt to synthesise the work of a group of labs with very disparate interests, but a common drive to use these kinds of model on big sets of neural data to answer deep questions about how brains work. Many of these are data labs, teams that analyse experimental data to answer their own questions; to name a few — Johnathan Pillow; Christian Machens; Konrad Kording; Kanaka Rajan; John Cunningham; Adrienne Fairhall; Philip Berens; Cian O’Donnell; Il Memming Park; Jakob Macke; Gasper Tkacik; Oliver Marre. Um, me. Others are experimental labs with strong data science inclinations: Anne Churchland; Mark Churchland; Nicole Rust; Krishna Shenoy; Carlos Brody; many others I apologise for not naming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are conferences where this kind of work &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cosyne.org/c/index.php?title=Cosyne_18&quot;&gt;is welcomed&lt;/a&gt;, nay &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/conferences-meetings/isn2017/&quot;&gt;even encouraged&lt;/a&gt;. A journal for neural data science is on its way. Something is building. Come on in, the data’s lovely*.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* yeah I had to refer to data as a singular to get that crap joke to work. The fact I’m writing this footnote to explain this will give you some idea of the fastidious attention to detail neural data scientists expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=d7e3969086f2&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/a-neural-data-science-how-and-why-d7e3969086f2&quot;&gt;A neural data science: how and why&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike&quot;&gt;The Spike&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691618755704?journalCode=ppsa&quot;&gt;pre-registered mass replication attempt&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Perspectives on Psychological Science&lt;/i&gt; has raised doubts about another celebrated psychology finding. The collaboration between 40 laboratories found scant evidence for the so-called “Professor Prime”, undermining the famous finding that when people imagined themselves as a professor rather than a football hooligan it led them to perform better on a trivia quiz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33556&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the original study, &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-01060-003&quot;&gt;published in 1998&lt;/a&gt;, the Dutch researchers Ap Dijksterhuis and Daan Van Knippenberg asked participants to spend five minutes writing about themselves as if they were a professor or a football hooligan, thus priming them with one concept or the other. Next, the participants completed an unrelated trivia test of twenty questions, and those primed with the professor concept achieved an average of two and a half more correct answers  – a 13 per cent advantage – versus those in the hooligan condition. The authors concluded that “priming a stereotype or trait leads to complex overt behavior in line with this activated stereotype or trait”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was part of an exciting new wave of research that moved beyond earlier priming studies that had focused on how “primes” make it easier to recognise related concepts (e.g. encountering the prime word “football” makes us quicker to recognise related words like “goal” or “game”). The field became animated by so-called “social priming” claims, like John Bargh’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-06400-003&quot;&gt;classic study&lt;/a&gt; that suggested priming the concept of elderliness led participants to walk away from the lab more slowly (a finding that other labs failed to replicate, helping to spark the so-called replication crisis in psychology).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidst this crisis, until now the Professor Prime finding – perhaps the kingpin of these effects – was still standing (even if lampooned by, among others, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DrPrimestei&quot;&gt;Dr Primestein Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;). The effect became the focus of this latest mass replication attempt (known as a “registered replication report”) when, in a great example of collaborative science, Dijksterhuis and Van Knippenberg volunteered their study as the latest to face scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to releasing their original materials to the other participating labs, Dijksterhuis and Van Knippenberg re-ran their own study and found a smaller effect than they had previously, and one that was confined to male participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure followed by the other 40 labs was almost identical to the original, except they used a new set of 30 trivia questions pretested to ensure a useful range of difficulty. Unlike the original, they also preregistered their stopping conditions (at what point they would cease looking for further participants; selective stopping is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/12/01/questionable-research-practices-are-rife-in-psychology-survey-suggests/&quot;&gt;questionable research practice&lt;/a&gt; that can lead to misrepresentation of experimental effects). The labs also aimed for a gender balance between participants, which only 23 of them achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas the original study showed a 13 per cent advantage to participants who got the Professor Prime, the average effect achieved by 23 labs involving over 5,500 participants found an advantage of just 0.014 per cent – almost 100 times weaker – and the variability across studies meant that this tiny effect was not statistically significant. Restricting the analysis to only male participants made no difference, and when the data from all 40 labs was included (i.e. also including those with a gender bias in their sample), the effect was even smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only hint of an effect came after the researchers excluded anyone who thought the priming task was in any way linked to the trivia task – which was two thirds of the participants – in which case the Professor Prime was associated with a 2 per cent advantage. This is still much smaller than the original and there must be doubts about the meaningfulness of a small effect that is present only in a minority of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way to see this as anything other than yet another serious blow to the social priming literature. But it’s also a success for non-adversarial science – an example of psychology cleaning up its issues and coming to a better understanding of the effects that matter enough for us to investigate further.&lt;/p&gt;

How does physical “stuff”—atoms, molecules, chemicals, and cells—create the vivid and various alive worlds inside our heads? This problem has gnawed at us for millennia. In the last century there have been massive breakthroughs that have rewritten the science of the brain, and yet the puzzles faced by the ancient Greeks are still present. In this lecture I review the the history of human thinking about the mind/brain problem, giving a big-picture view of what science has revealed. Understanding how consciousness could emanate from a confederation of independent brain modules working together will help define the future of brain science and artificial intelligence, and close the gap between brain and mind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus there is a jam packed schedule of posters, talks, and prestigious award recipients/presenters on Sunday through Tuesday.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="fr-FR">
 &lt;p&gt;Our sensors give us an incomplete, noisy, and indirect information about the world. For example, estimating the location of a sound source is difficult because in natural contexts, the sound of interest is corrupted by other sound sources, reflections, etc. Thus it is not possible to know the position of the source with certainty. The ‘Bayesian coding hypothesis’ (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15541511&quot;&gt;Knill &amp;amp; Pouget, 2014&lt;/a&gt;) postulates that the brain represents not the most likely position, but the entire probability distribution of the position. It then uses those distributions to do Bayesian inference, for example, when combining different sources of information (say, auditory and visual). This would allow the brain to optimally infer the most likely position. There is indeed some evidence for optimal inference in psychophysical experiments – although there is also some contradicting evidence (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/suboptimality-in-perceptual-decision-making/F0F0F136CA71A23F2DF3BC3E2ED4297B&quot;&gt;Rahnev &amp;amp; Denison, 2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea has some appeal. The problem is that, by framing perception as a statistical inference problem, it focuses on the most trivial type of uncertainty, statistical uncertainty. It is illustrated by the following quote: “The fundamental concept behind the Bayesian approach to perceptual computations is that the information provided by a set of sensory data about the world is represented by a conditional probability density function over the set of unknown variables”. Implicit in this representation is a particular model, for which variables are defined. Typically, one model describes a particular experimental situation. For example, the model would describe the distribution of auditory cues associated with the position of the sound source. Another situation would be described by a different model, for example one with two sound sources would require a model with two variables. Or if the listening environment is a room and the size of that room might vary, then we would need a model with the dimensions of the room as variables. In any of these cases where we have identified and fixed parametric sources of variation, then the Bayesian approach works fine, because we are indeed facing a problem of statistical inference. But that framework doesn’t fit any real life situation. In real life, perceptual scenes have variable structure, which corresponds to the model in statistical inference (there is one source, or two sources, we are in a room, the second source comes from the window, etc). The perceptual problem is therefore not just to infer the parameters of the model (dimensions of the room etc), but also the model itself, its structure. Thus, it is not possible in general to represent an auditory scene by a probability distribution on a set of parameters, because the very notion of a parameter already assumes that the structure of the scene is known and fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inferring parameters for a known statistical model is relatively easy. What is really difficult, and is still challenging for machine learning algorithms today, is to identify the structure of a perceptual scene, what constitutes an object (object formation), how objects are related to each other (scene analysis). These fundamental perceptual processes do not exist in the Bayesian brain. This touches on two very different types of uncertainty: statistical uncertainty, variations that can be interpreted and expected in the framework of a model; and epistemic uncertainty,  the model is unknown (the difference has been famously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiPe1OiKQuk&quot;&gt;explained by Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the “Bayesian brain” idea addresses an interesting problem (statistical inference), but it trivializes the problem of perception, by missing the fact that the real challenge is epistemic uncertainty (building a perceptual model), not statistical uncertainty (tuning the parameters): the world is not noisy, it is complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Title: A mitochondrial ferredoxin is essential for biogenesis of cellular iron-sulfur proteins What Caught Our Attention: Here’s a cut-and-paste issue that gave us pause. The authors of an 18-year-old paper in PNAS corrected it after realizing some bands in a figure were duplicated (an issue raised on PubPeer one year ago). It turns out, the … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/23/caught-our-notice-the-first-author-cut-the-thermoprinter-paper-printout-into-pieces-and-reassembled-them/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Caught Our Notice: “The first author cut the thermoprinter paper printout into pieces and reassembled them”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/ant-947402_1920-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When exploring forests of Central and South America it is common to stumble across highways of countless ants transporting large chunks of plant material. These are leaf-cutting ants, the dominant herbivores of the Neotropics, collecting leaves and flowers they feed to a fungus crop they cultivate in underground chambers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This symbiosis is similar to our own agriculture in many ways: the ants are obligately dependent on the fungus for food, they fertilize it using material they collect, and even use antibiotics to treat fungus garden diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mutualistic relationship has long drawn the attention of scientists trying to understand the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation between organisms across kingdoms of life. However, these ants are also fascinating because of their unique mating biology, and because the queens are extraordinarily long-lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mating idiosyncrasies of leaf-cutting ants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A queen can live for two or three decades, during which she will never re-mate, but will prudently use the sperm from these males to fertilize millions of eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaf-cutting ant queens mate during a single mating event early in adult life. When a queen embarks on a mating flight, she will mate with multiple male partners, and return to the ground to shed her wings and seek a suitable place to burrow a nest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet while the males drop dead almost immediately after they have delivered sperm to queens, a queen can live for two or three decades, during which she will never re-mate, but will prudently use the sperm from these males — stored in a specialized organ called the spermatheca — to fertilize millions of eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such lengthy sperm storage represents a record in the animal kingdom, and creates an exceptional lifetime commitment between partners — it would be analogous to vertebrate females being constantly pregnant with sperm of a few males that need to be kept alive at ambient temperature and protected from senescence mechanisms for years after the male partners are dead and gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since multiple males inseminate a leaf-cutting ant queen in a single afternoon, the spermatozoa of different males compete for storage in the queen spermatheca. This interplay between competition for storage and the need to remain alive for many years after storage has created unique evolutionary adaptations in ant sperm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unravelling reproductive conflicts in ants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fertility research in vertebrates has firmly established that sperm are capable of responding to subtle changes in their surroundings, allowing them to reach and fertilize female eggs more effectively. These can be changes in pH, ion concentrations or temperature of reproductive tracts and glandular secretions, or the presence of specific molecules that attract sperm to fertilization sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adapting an experimental procedure to quantify sperm motility normally used in vertebrate studies, we discovered that ant sperm are able to do the same: not only do a greater proportion of sperm become motile and swim faster when in contact with secretions of male and queen reproductive organs, but they do so differently depending on whether these secretions belong to themselves, or to queens and rival males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first noticed that when ejaculates from different males are mixed, sperm motility increases compared to when the same ejaculates swim individually. To identify the factors inducing these increases, we performed additional experiments by collecting sperm from a focal male and making them swim in seminal fluid from the same male, from a rival male, or in secretions from different compartments of the queen reproductive organs, as well as mixes of these various fluids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that, compared to a saline control, the seminal fluid that is ejaculated together with sperm enhanced motility, and that motility was further increased as soon as these sperm came into contact with either the seminal fluid of a rival male or fluid contained in a queen’s spermatheca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since, from the perspective of the focal sperm, both the rival male seminal fluid and queen spermathecal fluid are secretions from non-self tissue, we concluded that the sperm must respond to molecules present in non-self secretions and regulate motility accordingly — a response that makes sense when the presence of rival ejaculates means that racing for storage will increase a male’s reproductive success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do sperm differentiate between own and alien secretions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sperm could potentially become maximally mobile as soon as they are inseminated in a queen, independently of the presence of any competing sperm, so why do they swim slower in their own seminal fluid? Expressing a recognition mechanism to differentiate between self and non-self is presumably costly, so our observations require an evolutionary explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be a trade-off between the increased motility required to win the competitive race for storage and the long-term survival of sperm once they are in storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hypothesize that this recognition evolved because sustaining sperm motility is energetically expensive and leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Sperm are particularly susceptible to structural damage incurred by ROS because they lack extensive damage repair mechanisms, meaning that any increase in ROS will likely lead to irreversible loss of sperm fertilization capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, there may be a trade-off between the increased motility required to win the competitive race for storage and the long-term survival of sperm once they are in storage — important because it may be many years before they are used to fertilize eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from multiple studies suggest ROS damage control is a key factor in maintaining sperm viability — queens of multiple ant and bee species upregulate anti-oxidative enzymes after sperm storage, and these enzymes are also abundant in their seminal fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, to shed further light upon the evolutionary dilemma of how ants ensure long-term sperm survival in spite of costly sperm competition, future research should try to measure the ROS production associated with sperm motility more explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can a brief video telling students that it’s possible to improve their intelligence and abilities make much difference to their educational outcomes? And if fostering a “growth mindset” in this way does make a difference, does it benefit all students and schools equally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research on growth mindset over the past twenty years has progressed from experiments in a laboratory into real world settings, such as classrooms. This has shown that having a growth mindset leads to a small but positive &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/do-students-with-a-growth-mindset-get-better-grades&quot;&gt;improvement in grades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/08/a-30-minute-lesson-in-the-malleability-of-personality-has-long-term-benefits-for-anxious-depressed-teenagers/&quot;&gt;better mental health.&lt;/a&gt; But to date, little work has examined whether a brief mindset intervention is likely to help some adolescents more than others, especially those at greater risk of poor outcomes later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keen to rectify this, 23 of the leading researchers in this field, including the likes of Carol Dweck, Angela Duckworth and David Yeager, recently collaborated on a large study which they released briefly as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/md2qa&quot;&gt;pre-print&lt;/a&gt; (they are now revising the manuscript pending submission to peer review). As a Chartered Psychologist who delivers mindset workshops, I believe the preliminary findings are extremely promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33510&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved 12,542 ninth grade students aged 14 to 15-years-old from 65 different US schools. They watched two 25-minute videos, roughly twenty days apart, early in the school year. Half the students, randomly determined, watched two growth mindset videos featuring clips about the brain that explained that intellectual abilities are not fixed but can be developed. The other half of the students acted as the control group and watched two videos about the brain in general but unrelated to growth mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers took several steps to ensure scientific rigour. This was possibly because of the recent issues in psychology around &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/&quot;&gt;failed replications of other studies&lt;/a&gt; or to avoid any accusations of bias. This included pre-registering their hypothesis and having an independent third party recruit the sample and administer the intervention. Finally, neither the students, teachers, nor the people analysing the data knew who had been in the intervention and who had been in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those students who received the growth mindset intervention went on to achieve higher grades at the end of the school year than the controls (a .03 grade point difference, on average). Furthermore, and as they predicted, the researchers found that the intervention’s effect was most pronounced for struggling students, who achieved .08 more grade points on average compared with struggling students in the control condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the growth mindset students were 3 per cent less likely to fall into the “poor performance threshold” with GPAs in the D or F range than those in the control group – putting them  “on a new trajectory” in the researchers’ words, and reducing the likelihood of their graduation being delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are struggling students more likely to benefit from this sort of intervention? The researchers suggest that high achieving students “may already have habits (e.g. turning in work on time) or beliefs (e.g. a growth mindset) that lead to higher grades”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth mindset intervention also had different positive outcomes depending on which school the students went to. For struggling students that went to a school that was not in the top 25 per cent for academic performance, the intervention had a positive impact on their grades. Students who attended high achieving schools did not get a boost to grades but were more likely to choose more challenging courses the following year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, students who attended schools with a culture that endorses high expectations and academic effort benefited most from the intervention. This suggests that if students receive a growth mindset message but feel that it is at odds with the practices, behaviour and ethos of the school, it is unlikely to have much impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the pertinent practical considerations from this study is not to do with magnitude of the intervention’s initial effect (which at three percentage points with regards to graduation doesn’t sound huge at first), but rather the impact of the intervention relative to the time, cost and effort it takes to implement it, and how it can potentially change the trajectory that a young person is on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regards to this, the authors made three points worth considering. First, the intervention lasted under an hour. Second, it was very cheap, especially when compared against other types of interventions that have achieved a similar impact. For example, they note that a supplementary literacy course cost £2,000 per student. Third, because the intervention was delivered online, it is highly scaleable – the researchers estimate that rolling out the intervention nationwide would benefit approximately 98,000 students across the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude that their findings “illustrate the power of even slight adjustments in motivational priorities to create enduring change during adolescence”. Given that shifting the needle on student achievement and graduation rates is notoriously difficult, any intervention that is short, inexpensive and scalable is something definitely worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;

 Nerd Food: Neurons for Computer Geeks - Part IV: More Electricity&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks.html&quot;&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt; of this series looked at a neuron from above; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks_31.html&quot;&gt;Part II&lt;/a&gt; attempted to give us the fundamental building blocks in electricity required to get us on the road to modeling neurons. We did a quick interlude with a bit of coding in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks_4.html&quot;&gt;part III&lt;/a&gt; but now, sadly, we must return to boring theory once more. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now that we grok the basics of electricity, we need to turn our attention to the &lt;i&gt;RC circuit&lt;/i&gt;. As we shall see, this circuit is of particular interest when modeling neurons. The RC circuit is so called because it is a circuit, and it is composed of a Resistor and a Capacitor. We've already got some vague understanding of circuits and resistors, so lets start by having a look at this new crazy critter, &lt;i&gt;the capacitor&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-1&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Capacitors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like the battery is a source of current, one can think of the capacitor as a temporary store of current. If you plug a capacitor into a circuit with just a battery, it will start to &quot;accumulate&quot; charge over time, up to a &quot;maximum limit&quot;. But how exactly does this process work? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/circuits-topic/circuits-with-capacitors/v/capacitors-and-capacitance&quot;&gt;In simple terms&lt;/a&gt;, the capacitor is made up of two metal plates, one of which will connect to the positive end of the battery and another which connects to the negative end. At the positive end, the metal plate will start to lose negative charges because these are attracted to the positive end of the battery. This will make this metal plate positively charged. Similarly, at the negative end, the plate will start to accumulate negative charges. This happens because the electrons are repelled by the negative end of the battery. Whilst this process is taking place, the capacitor is &lt;i&gt;charging&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At some point, the process reaches a kind of equilibrium, whereby the electrons in the positively charged plate are attracted equally to the plate as they are to the positive end of the battery, and thus stop flowing. At this point we say the capacitor is &lt;i&gt;charged&lt;/i&gt;. It is interesting to note that both plates of the capacitor end up with the same &quot;total&quot; charge but different signs (i.e. &lt;code&gt;-q&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;+q&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-1-1&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-1-1&quot;&gt;Capacitance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-1-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We mentioned a &quot;maximum limit&quot;. A few things control this limit: how big the plates are, how much space there is between them and the kind of material we place between them, if any. The bigger the plates and the closer they are - without touching - the more you can store in the capacitor. The material used for the plates is, of course, of great importance too - it must be some kind of metal good at conducting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a more technical language, this notion of a limit is captured by the concept of &lt;i&gt;capacitance&lt;/i&gt;, and is given by the following formula: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} C = \frac{q}{V} \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;Lets break it down to its components to see what the formula is trying to tell us. The role of &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; is to inform us about the potential difference between the two plates. This much is easy to grasp; since one plate is positively charged and other negatively charged, it is therefore straightforward to imagine that a charge will have a different electric potential in each plate, and thus that there will be an electric potential difference between them. &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; tells us about the magnitude of the charges that we placed on the plates - i.e. ignoring the sign. It wouldn't be to great a leap to conceive that plates with a larger surface area would probably have more &quot;space&quot; for charges and so a larger &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; - and vice-versa. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Capacitance is then the ratio between these two things; a measure of how much electric charge one can store for a given potential difference. It may not be very obvious from this formula, but capacitance is constant. That is to say, a given capacitor has a capacitance, influenced by the properties described above. This formula does not describe the discharging or charging process - but of course, capacitance is used in the formulas that describe those. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Capacitance is measured in SI units of Farads, denoted by the letter  &lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt;. A farad is 1 coulomb over 1 volt: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} 1F = \frac{C}{V} \end{align} &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-1-2&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-1-2&quot;&gt;Capacitors and Current&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-1-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After charging a capacitor, one may be tempted to discharge it. For that one could construct a simple circuit with just the capacitor. Once the circuit is closed, the negative charges will start to flow to the positively charged plate, at full speed - minus the resistance of the material. Soon enough both plates would be made neutral. At first glance, this may appear to be very similar to our previous circuit with a battery. However, there is one crucial difference: the battery circuit had a constant voltage and a constant current (for a theoretical battery) whereas a circuit with a discharging capacitor has voltage and current that &lt;i&gt;decay&lt;/i&gt; over time. By &quot;decaying&quot;, all we really mean is that we start at some arbitrarily high value and we move towards zero over a period of time. This makes intuitive sense: you cannot discharge the capacitor forever; and, as you discharge it, the voltage starts to decrease - for there are less charges in the plates and so less potential difference - and similarly, so does the current - for there is less &quot;pressure&quot; to make the charges flow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This intuition is formally captured by the following equation: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} I(t) = C \frac{dV(t)}{dt} \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;I'm rather afraid that, at this juncture, we have no choice but to introduce Calculus. A proper explanation of Calculus a tad outside the remit of these posts, so instead we will have to make do with some common-sense but extremely hand-waved interpretations of the ideas behind it. If you are interested in a light-hearted but still comprehensive treatment of the subject, perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;http://betterexplained.com/articles/a-gentle-introduction-to-learning-calculus/&quot;&gt;A Gentle Introduction To Learning Calculus&lt;/a&gt; may be to your liking. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let's start by taking a slightly different representation of the formula above and then compare these two formulas. &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} i = C \frac{dv}{dt} \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;In the first case we are talking about the current &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;, which normally is some kind of average current over some unspecified period. Up to now, &lt;i&gt;time&lt;/i&gt; didn't really matter - so we got away with just talking about &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; in these general terms. This was the case with the Ohm's Law in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks_31.html&quot;&gt;part II&lt;/a&gt;. However, as we've seen, it is not so with capacitors - so we need to make the current specific to a point in time. For that we supply an &quot;argument&quot; to I - &lt;code&gt;I(t)&lt;/code&gt;; here, a mathematician would say that that &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; is a function of &lt;i&gt;time&lt;/i&gt;. In the second case, we make use of &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, which is the &lt;i&gt;instantaneous current&lt;/i&gt; through the capacitor. The idea is that, somehow, we are able to know - for any point in time - what the instantaneous current is. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How we achieve that is via the magic of Calculus. The expression &lt;code&gt;dv/dt&lt;/code&gt; in the second formula provides us with the instantaneous rate of change of the voltage over time. The same notion can be applied to &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;, as per first formula. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These formulas may sound awfully complicated, but what they are trying to tell us is that the capacitor's current has the following properties: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;it varies as a &quot;function&quot; of time; that is to say, different time points have different currents. Well, that's pretty consistent with our simplistic notion of a decaying current. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;it is &quot;scaled&quot; by the capacitor's capacitance &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;; &quot;bigger&quot; capacitors can hold on to higher currents for longer when compared to &quot;smaller&quot; capacitors. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the change in electric potential difference varies as a function of time. This is subtle but also makes sense: we imagined some kind of decay for our voltage, but there was nothing to say the decay would remain &lt;i&gt;constant&lt;/i&gt; until we reached zero. This formula tells us it does not; voltage may decrease faster or slower at different points in time. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-2&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Circuits: Parallel and Series&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RC circuit can appear in a parallel or series form, so its a good time to introduce these concepts. One way we can connect circuits is in &lt;i&gt;series&lt;/i&gt;; that is, all components are connected along a single path, such that the current flows through &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of them, one after the other. If any component fails, the flow will cease. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is best understood by way of example. Lets imagine the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/circuits/Lesson-4/Two-Types-of-Connections&quot;&gt;canonical example&lt;/a&gt; of a battery - our old friend the 1.5V AA battery - and a three small light bulbs. A circuit that connects them in series would be made up of a cable segment plugged onto one of the battery's terminals - say &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, then connected to the first light bulb. A second cable segment would then connect this light bulb to another light bulb, followed by another segment and another light bulb. Finally, a cable segment would connect the light build to the other battery terminal - say &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;. Graphically - and pardoning my inability to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia/&quot;&gt;Dia&lt;/a&gt; to create circuit diagrams - it would look more or less like this: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;series_circuit.png&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/mcraveiro/neurite/raw/master/doc/blog/images/series_circuit.png&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;figure-number&quot;&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/span&gt; Series circuit. Source: Author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This circuit has a few interesting properties. First, if any of the light bulbs fail, all of them will stop working because the circuit is no longer closed. Second, if one were to add more and more light bulbs, the brightness of each light bulb will start to decrease. This is because each light bulb is in effect a resistor - the light shining being a byproduct of said resistance - and so they are each decreasing the current. So it is that in a series circuit the total resistance is given by the sum of all individual resistances, and the current is the same for all elements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parallel circuits are a bit different. The idea is that two or more components are connected to the circuit &lt;i&gt;in parallel&lt;/i&gt;, i.e. there are two or more paths along which the current can flow at the same time. So we'd have to modify our example to have a path to each of the light bulbs which exists in parallel to the main path - quite literally a segment of cable that connects the other segments of cable, more or less like so: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;parallel_circuit.png&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/mcraveiro/neurite/raw/master/doc/blog/images/parallel_circuit.png&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;figure-number&quot;&gt;Figure 2:&lt;/span&gt; Parallel circuit. Source: Author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here you can see that if a bulb fails, there is still a closed loop in which current can flow, so the other bulbs should be unaffected. This also means that the voltage is the same for all components in the circuit. Current and resistance are now &quot;relative&quot; to each component, and it is possible to compute the overall current for the circuit via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%2527s_circuit_laws#Kirchhoff.27s_current_law_.28KCL.29&quot;&gt;Kirchhoff's Current Law&lt;/a&gt;. Simplifying it, it means that the current for the circuit is the sum of all currents flowing through each component. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This will become significant later on when we finally return to the world of neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-3&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;The RC Circuit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all of this we can now move to the &lt;i&gt;RC circuit&lt;/i&gt;. In its simplest form, the circuit has a source of current with a resistor and a capacitor: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Discharging_capacitor.svg&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Discharging_capacitor.svg&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;figure-number&quot;&gt;Figure 3:&lt;/span&gt; Source: Wikipedia, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_circuit&quot;&gt;RC circuit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let's try to understand how the capacitor's voltage will behave over time. This circuit is rather similar to the one we analysed when discussing capacitance, with the exception that we now have a resistor as well. But in order to understand this, we must return to Kirchhoff's current law, which we hand-waved a few paragraphs ago. Wikipedia tells us that: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a point is zero. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;One way to understand this statement is to think that the total quantity of current entering a junction point must be identical to the total quantity leaving that junction point. If we consider entering to be positive and leaving to be negative, that means that adding the two together must yield zero. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because of Kirchhoff's law, we can state that, for the positive terminal of the capacitor: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} i_c(t) + i_r(t) = 0 \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;That is: at any particular point in time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;, the current flowing through the capacitor added to the current flowing through the resistor must sum to zero. However, we can now make use of the previous formulas; after all, our section on capacitance taught us that: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} i_c(t) = C \frac{dv(t)}{dt} \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;And making use of Ohm's Law we can also say that: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} i_r(t) = \frac{v(t)}{R} \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;So we can expand the original formula to: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} C \frac{dv(t)}{dt} + \frac{v(t)}{R} \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;Or: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} C \frac{dV}{dt} + \frac{V}{R} \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;I'm not actually going to follow the remaining steps to compute &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;, but you can see them &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digilentinc.com/classroom/realanalog/text/Chapter_2p4p2.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and they are fairly straighforward, or at least as straightforward as calculus gets. The key point is, when you solve the differential equation for &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;, you get: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} V(t) = V_0e^{-\frac{t}{RC}} \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;V0&lt;/code&gt; being voltage when time is zero. This is called the circuit's &lt;i&gt;natural response&lt;/i&gt;. This equation is &lt;i&gt;very important&lt;/i&gt;. Note that we are now able to describe the behaviour of voltage over time with just a few inputs: the starting voltage, the time, the resistance and the capacitance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A second thing falls off of this equation: the RC Time constant, or τ. It is given by: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} \tau = RC \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;The Time Constant is described in a very useful way &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tpub.com/neets/book2/3d.htm&quot;&gt;in this page&lt;/a&gt;, so I'll just quote them and their chart here: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time required to charge a capacitor to 63 percent (actually 63.2 percent) of full charge or to discharge it to 37 percent (actually 36.8 percent) of its initial voltage is known as the TIME CONSTANT (TC) of the circuit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;32NE0159.GIF&quot; src=&quot;http://www.tpub.com/neets/book2/32NE0159.GIF&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;figure-number&quot;&gt;Figure 4:&lt;/span&gt; The RC Time constant.

 Nerd Food: Neurons for Computer Geeks - Part VI: Integrate and Fire!&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to part VI of a multi-part series on modeling neurons. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks_7.html&quot;&gt;part V&lt;/a&gt; we added a tad more theory to link electricity with neurons, and also tried to give an idea of just how complex neurons are. Looking back on that post, I cannot help but notice I skipped one bit that is rather important to understanding Integrate-and-Fire (IAF) models. So lets look at that first and then return to our trail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-1&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Resting Potential and Action Potential&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have spoken &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks_7.html&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential&quot;&gt;membrane potential&lt;/a&gt; and the resting membrane potential, but we did so with such a high degree of hand-waving it now warrants revisiting. When we are talking about the &lt;i&gt;resting&lt;/i&gt; membrane potential we mean just that - the value for the membrane potential when nothing much is happening. That is the magical circa -65mv we discussed before - with all of the related explanations on conventions around negative voltages. However, time does not stand still and things happen. The cell receives input from other neurons, and this varies over time. Some kinds of inputs can cause events to trigger on the receiving neuron: active ion channels may get opened or shut, ions move around, concentrations change and so forth, and thus, the cell will change its membrane potential in response. When these changes result in a higher voltage - such as moving to -60mv - we say a &lt;i&gt;depolarisation&lt;/i&gt; is taking place. Conversely, when the voltage becomes more negative, we say &lt;i&gt;hyperpolarisation&lt;/i&gt; is occurring. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, it may just happen that there is a short-lived but &quot;strong&quot; burst of depolarisation, followed by equally rapid hyperpolarisation - and, as a result of which, the Axon's terminal decides to release &lt;i&gt;neurotransmitters&lt;/i&gt; into the synapse (well, into the &lt;i&gt;synaptic gap&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;synaptic cleft&lt;/i&gt; to be precise). This is called an &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential&quot;&gt;action potential&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, and it is also known by many other names such as &quot;nerve impulses&quot; or &quot;spikes&quot;. When you hear that &quot;a neuron has fired&quot; this means that an action potential has just been emitted. If you record the neuron's behaviour over time you will see a &lt;i&gt;spike train&lt;/i&gt; - a plot of the voltage over time, clearly showing the spikes. Taking a fairly random example: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Simulation_of_hrose_neuron.png&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Simulation_of_hrose_neuron.png&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;figure-number&quot;&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/span&gt; Source: Wikipedia, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_oscillation&quot;&gt;Neural oscillation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;One way of picturing this is as a kind of &quot;chain-reaction&quot; whereby something triggers the voltage of the neuron to rise, which triggers a number of gates to open, which then trigger the voltage to rise and so on, until some kind of magic voltage threshold is reached where the inverse occurs: the gates that were causing the voltage to rise shut and some other gates that cause the voltage to decrease open, and so on, until we fall back down to the resting membrane potential. The process feeds back on itself, first as a positive feedback and then as a negative feedback. In the case of the picture above, something else triggers us again and again, until we finally come to rest. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This spiking or firing behaviour is what we are trying to model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-2&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Historical Background&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it happens, we are not the first ones to try to do so. A couple of years after Einstein's &lt;i&gt;annus mirabilis&lt;/i&gt;, a french chap called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Lapicque&quot;&gt;Louis Lapicque&lt;/a&gt; was also going through his own personal moment of inspiration, the output of which was the seminal &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snv.jussieu.fr/brette/papers/Lap07.pdf&quot;&gt;Recherches quantitatives sur l'excitation électrique des nerfs traitée comme une polarisation&lt;/a&gt;. It is summarised &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~larry/AbbottBrResBul99.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in fairly accessible English by Abbot. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lapicque had the insight of imagining the neuron as an RC circuit, with the membrane potential's behaviour explained as the interplay between capacitor and resistor; the action potential is then the capacitor reaching a threshold followed by a discharge. Even with our faint understanding of the subject matter, one cannot but appreciate Lapique's brilliance to have the ability to reach these conclusions in 1907. Of course, he also had to rely on the work of many others to get there, let's not forget. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This model is still considered a useful model today, even though we know so much more about neurons now - a great example of what we mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks_7.html&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; in terms of the choices of the level of detail when modeling. Each model is designed for a specific purpose and it should be as simple as possible for the stated end (but no simpler). As &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~larry/AbbottBrResBul99.pdf&quot;&gt;Abbot&lt;/a&gt;says: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Lapicque, because of the limited knowledge of his time, had no choice but to model the action potential in a simple manner, the stereotypical character of action potentials allows us, even today, to use the same approximation to avoid computation of the voltage trajectory during an action potential. This allows us to focus both intellectual and computation resources on the issues likely to be most relevant in neural computation, without expending time and energy on modeling a phenomenon, the generation of action potentials, that is already well understood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-3&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;The IAF Family&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrate-and-Fire is actually a family of models - related because all of them follow Lapicque's original insights. Over time, people have addressed shortcomings in the model by adding more parameters and modifying it slightly and from this other models were born. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In general, models in the IAF family are single neuron models with a number of important properties (as per &lt;a href=&quot;http://cns-classes.bu.edu/cn510/Papers/Izhikevich_Ch8.pdf&quot;&gt;Izhikevich&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;The spikes are all or none; that is, we either spike or we don't. This is a byproduct of the way spikes are added to the model, as we shall see later. This also means all spikes are identical because the are all created the same way. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The threshold for the spike is well defined and there is no ambiguity as to whether the neuron will fire or not. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is possible to add a &lt;i&gt;refractory period&lt;/i&gt;, similarly to how we add the spike. The refractory period is a time during which the neuron is less excitable (e.g. ignores inputs) and occurs right after the spike. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Positive currents are used as excitatory inputs and negative currents as inhibitory inputs. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;But how do the members of this family look like? We will take a few examples from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neuron_model&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; to make a family portrait and then focus on LIF. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-3-1&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-3-1&quot;&gt;IAF: Integrate-and-Fire&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-3-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This the Lapicque model. It is also called a &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;non-leaky&quot; neuron. The formula is as follows: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} I(t) = C_m \frac{dV_m(t)}{dt} \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;'s are there to signify &lt;i&gt;membrane&lt;/i&gt;, nothing else. Note that its the job of the user to determine θ - that is the point at which the neuron spikes - and then to reset everything to zero and start again. If you are wondering why it's called &quot;integrate&quot;, that's because the differential equation must be integrated before we can compare the current value to a threshold and then, if we're passed it, well - fire!. Hence Integrate-and-Fire. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wikipedia states this in a classier way, of course: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[This formula] is just the time derivative of the law of capacitance, Q = CV. When an input current is applied, the membrane voltage increases with time until it reaches a constant threshold Vth, at which point a delta function spike occurs and the voltage is reset to its resting potential, after which the model continues to run. The firing frequency of the model thus increases linearly without bound as input current increases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-3-2&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-3-2&quot;&gt;Integrate-and-Fire with Refractory Period&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-3-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible to extend IAF to take the refractory period into account. This is done by adding a period of time &lt;i&gt;t ref&lt;/i&gt; during which the neuron does not fire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-3-3&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-3-3&quot;&gt;LIF: Leaky Integrate-and-Fire&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-3-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the problems of IAF is that it will &quot;remember&quot; stimulus, regardless of the time that elapses between stimuli. By way of example: if a neuron gets some input below the firing threshold at some time (say &lt;i&gt;ta&lt;/i&gt;), then nothing for a long period of time and then subsequent stimulus at say &lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt;, this will cause the neuron to fire (assuming the two inputs together are above the threshold). In the real world, neurons &quot;forget&quot; about below-threshold stimulus after certain amount of time has elapsed. This problem is solved in LIF by adding a &lt;i&gt;leak&lt;/i&gt; term to IAF. The Wikipedia's formula is like so: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} I_m(t) - \frac{V_m(t)}{R_m} = C_m \frac{dV_m(t)}{dt} \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;We will discuss it in detail later on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-4&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-3-3-1&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;sec-3-3-1&quot;&gt;Interlude: Leaky Integrators and Low-Pass Filters&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-4&quot; id=&quot;text-3-3-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: this section got moved here from an earlier post. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Minor detour into the world of &quot;Leaky Integrators&quot;. As it turns out, mathematicians even have a name to describe functions like the one above: they are called &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_integrator&quot;&gt;Leaky Integrators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. A leaky integrator is something that takes an input and &quot;integrates&quot; - that is, sums it over a range - but by doing so, starts &quot;leaking&quot; values out. In order words, a regular sum of values over a range should just result in an ever growing output. With a leaky integrator, we add up to a point, but then we start leaking, resetting the value of the sum back to where we started off. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It turns out these kind of functions have great utility. For example, imagine that you have a range of inputs varying from some arbitrary low number to some other arbitrary high-number. When you supply these inputs to a leaky integrator, it can be used to &quot;filter out&quot; the high numbers; input numbers higher than a certain cut-off point just result in zeros in the output. This is known as a &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter&quot;&gt;low-pass filter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. One can conceive of a function that acted in the opposite way - a &lt;i&gt;high-pass filter&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-3-4&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-3-4&quot;&gt;Exponential Integrate-and-Fire&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-3-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this model, spike generation is exponential: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} \frac{dX}{dt} = \Delta_\tau exp(\frac{X - X_t}{\Delta_\tau}) \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;Wikipedia explains it as follows: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;where X is the membrane potential, X&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is the membrane potential threshold, and Δ&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is the sharpness of action potential initiation, usually around 1 mV for cortical pyramidal neurons. Once the membrane potential crosses X&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, it diverges to infinity in finite time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-3&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-3-5&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-3-5&quot;&gt;Others&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-3-5&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We could continue and look into other IAF models, but you get the point. Each model has limitations, and as people work through those limitations - e.g. try to make the spike trains generated by the model closer to those observed in reality - they make changes to the model and create new members of the IAF family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-4&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-4&quot;&gt;Explaining the LIF Formula&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's look at a slightly more familiar formulation of LIF: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} \tau_m \frac{dv}{dt} = -v(t) + RI(t) \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;By now this should make vague sense, but lets do it step by step breakdown just to make sure we are all on the same page. First, we know that the current of the RC circuit is defined like so: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} I(t) = I_R + I_C \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;From Ohm's Law we also know that: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} I_R = \frac {v}{R} \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;And from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks_5.html&quot;&gt;rigmarole of the capacitor&lt;/a&gt; we also know that: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} I_C = C \frac{dv}{dt} \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;Thus its not much of a leap to say: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} I(t) = \frac {v(t)}{R} + C \frac{dv}{dt} \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;Now, if we now multiply both sides by R, we get: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} RI(t) = v(t) + RC \frac{dv}{dt} \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;Remember that RC is τ, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_time_constant&quot;&gt;RC time constant&lt;/a&gt;; in this case, we are dealing with the membrane so hence the &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;. With that, the rest of the rearranging to the original formula should be fairly obvious. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, if you recall, we mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_integrator&quot;&gt;Leaky Integrators&lt;/a&gt; before. You should hopefully be able to see the resemblance between these and our first formula. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note that we did not model spikes explicitly with this formula. However, when it comes to implementing it, all that is required is to look for a threshold value for the membrane potential - called the &lt;i&gt;spiking threshold&lt;/i&gt;; when that value is reached, we need to reset the membrane potential back to a lower value - the &lt;i&gt;reset potential&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And with that we have enough to start thinking about code… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-5&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-5&quot;&gt;Method in our Madness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-5&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;.. Or so you may think. First, a quick detour on discretisation. As it happens, computers are rather fond of discrete things rather than the continuous entities that inhabit the world of calculus. Computers are very much of the same opinion as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley&quot;&gt;the priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Berkeley/Analyst/Analyst.pdf&quot;&gt;who said&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what are these same evanescent Increments? They are neither finite Quantities nor Quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not call them the Ghosts of departed Quantities? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So we cannot directly represent differential equations in the computer - not even the simpler ordinary differential equations (ODEs), with their single independent variable. Instead, we need to approximate them with a &lt;i&gt;method&lt;/i&gt; for &lt;i&gt;numerical integration&lt;/i&gt; of the ODE. Remember: when we say &lt;i&gt;integration&lt;/i&gt; we just mean &quot;summing&quot;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once we enter the world of &lt;i&gt;methods&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;numerical analysis&lt;/i&gt; we are much closer to our ancestral home of Software Engineering. The job of numerical analysis is to look for ways in which one can make discrete approximations of the problems in mathematical analysis - like, say, calculus. The little recipes they come up with are called &lt;i&gt;numerical methods&lt;/i&gt;. A method is nothing more than an algorithm, a set of steps used iteratively. One such method is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method&quot;&gt;Euler Method&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;[a] numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value&quot;, as Wikipedia tells us, and as it happens that is exactly what we are trying to do. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So how does the Euler method work? Very simply. First you know that: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} y(t_0) = y_0 \\ y'(t) = f(t, y(t)) \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;That is, at the beginning of time we have a known value. Then, for all other &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;'s, we use the current value in &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; in order to be able to compute the next value. Lets imagine that our steps - how much we are moving forwards by - are of a size &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;. You can then say: &lt;/p&gt; \begin{align} t_{n+1} = t_n + h \\ y_{n+1} = y_n + h * f(x_n, t_n) \end{align}  &lt;p&gt;And that's it. You just need to know where you are right now, by how much you need to scale the function - e.g. the step size - and then apply the function to the current values of &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In code: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;src src-c++&quot;&gt;template&amp;lt;typename F&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;void euler(F f, double y0, double start, double end, double h) {&lt;br /&gt;    double y = y0;&lt;br /&gt;    for (auto t(start); t &amp;lt; end; t += h) {&lt;br /&gt;        y += h * f(t, y, h);&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are passing &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt; to the function &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; because it needs to know about the step size, but other than that it should be a pretty clean mapping from the maths above. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This method is also known as &lt;i&gt;Forward Euler&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Explicit Euler&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-6&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-6&quot;&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-6&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet again, we run out of time yet again before we can get into serious coding. In the next instalment we shall cover the implementation of the LIF model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;status&quot; id=&quot;postamble&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;Created: 2015-09-16 Wed 18:05&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;creator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&quot;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; 24.5.1 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org&quot;&gt;Org&lt;/a&gt; mode 8.2.10)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;validation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer&quot;&gt;Validate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;If you want to feel happier, avoid small talk and aim instead for profound conversations. That was the message the mainstream media took from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2861779/&quot;&gt;well-publicised paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/i&gt; in 2010 (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/17/talk-deeply-be-happy/&quot;&gt;Talk Deeply, Be Happy?&lt;/a&gt; asked the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;). But now an extension of that study, in press at the same journal (available as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anne_Milek/publication/323399744_Eavesdropping_on_Happiness_Revisited_A_Pooled_Multi-Sample_Replication_of_the_Association_between_Life_Satisfaction_and_Observed_Daily_Conversation_Quantity_and_Quality/links/5a943c190f7e9ba42970bf86/Eavesdropping-on-Happiness-Revisited-A-Pooled-Multi-Sample-Replication-of-the-Association-between-Life-Satisfaction-and-Observed-Daily-Conversation-Quantity-and-Quality.pdf&quot;&gt;a pre-print&lt;/a&gt;), and involving two of the psychologists behind the original work, has found no evidence that how much – or little – time  you spend chatting about the weather or what you’re having for dinner will affect your life satisfaction. “The failure to replicate the original small talk effect is important as it has garnered considerable scientific and lay interest,” note the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33522&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original work, led by Matthias Mehl at the University of Arizona, involved just 79 US college students, and given that students are surrounded by a host of potential new friends, not exactly representative of the general population in terms of daily social interactions. So Mehl, Simine Vazire at UC-Davis, and other researchers assessed the conversations of three new groups of people – 50 women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer, and their partners; 184 medically healthy adults; and 122 adults who had recently separated from their partners. These participants also completed life satisfaction and personality questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the original paper, the participants wore Electronically Activated Recorders (EARs) that regularly sampled ambient sounds – including conversations – for between 30- to 50-seconds every 9 or 12.5 minutes, depending on the specific group taking part. All participants wore the EARs between a Friday night and Monday morning, and they were allowed to review the recordings and delete any that they preferred to remain private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coders listened back to the recordings and assessed both the frequency and type of conversations each participant engaged in. Small talk was defined as uninvolved, banal conversation in which only trivial information was exchanged (e.g. “I stepped on something”, “What are you up to?”); “Substantive” conversations involved the exchange of “meaningful” information (e.g. “There are a lot of high-stress A-type personalities out there” and “They have already raised ten million dollars for Haiti.”) Other types of conversations – involving gossip, say, or practical information – were also noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the different groups, participants who were happier tended to have more conversations, with the two measures having a modest correlation. There was also a moderately positive association between engaging specifically in more substantive conversations and life satisfaction (but this was a less strong result than in the original study). Crucially, however, there was no association at all between engaging in more small talk and expressing less life satisfaction – the finding that grabbed the headlines previously. Also, contrary to one of the team’s initial predictions, how extraverted or introverted a person was also made no real difference to associations between conversation type and life satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further contradicting the original small talk findings, other recent research has actually found that small talk can make people feel happier. In 2016, for example, Nicholas Epley at the University of Chicago led &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/08/15/were-happier-when-we-chat-to-strangers-but-our-instinct-is-to-ignore-them/&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; finding that no matter what their positions on the extraversion spectrum, people felt more positive after engaging strangers in conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In relation to the new paper, it’s worth noting that as two of the four groups consisted of people going through major life events, these results may not be generalisable to the general population. And, as the authors themselves note in relation to the main positive finding, the data is correlational: “Whether it is the satisfied person who attracts more substantive conversations or whether having substantive conversations makes people more satisfied with their lives is still to be clarified in future (experimental) research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anne_Milek/publication/323399744_Eavesdropping_on_Happiness_Revisited_A_Pooled_Multi-Sample_Replication_of_the_Association_between_Life_Satisfaction_and_Observed_Daily_Conversation_Quantity_and_Quality/links/5a943c190f7e9ba42970bf86/Eavesdropping-on-Happiness-Revisited-A-Pooled-Multi-Sample-Replication-of-the-Association-between-Life-Satisfaction-and-Observed-Daily-Conversation-Quantity-and-Quality.pdf&quot;&gt;Eavesdropping on Happiness” Revisited: A Pooled, Multi-Sample Replication of the Asso- ciation between Life Satisfaction and Observed Daily Conversation Quantity and Quality&lt;/a&gt; [this is a pre-print of a paper that’s in press: the final published version may be different]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Scientific research is advancing without pause; innovations are emerging at a breathtaking rate all over the world through the endeavors of diverse scientific disciplines. The future of scientific research is set on an unpredictable course teeming with both excitement and unease — whether AI-enabled tools will reshape drug discovery or if “patient-on-a-chip” technology will let future scientists create custom therapies for patients on the spot remains to be seen. Amidst the uncertainty, one thing remains clear: Science Exchange will be your fastest path to accessing new and emerging research tools, technologies, and services as the future continues to unfold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A moment’s time is all you need to learn about the benefits of five promising technologies that may play an integral role in the near future.

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;These novel affinity reagents, sometimes called “plastic antibodies,” have similar specificity to antibodies and can replace antibodies in in vitro applications, including sensing, imaging, purification, analysis, and diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;NanoMIPs are nanostructured Molecularly Imprinted Polymers, which typically contain a single binding site to a template molecule. NanoMIPs are prepared via a proprietary imprinting process that involves the self-assembly of binding monomers around a target template—these monomers are then polymerized to generate a “synthetic receptor” with high affinity and specificity to the template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Unlike conventional technologies, FANAs have high fidelity for the RNA target and highly reduced off-target effects (no RISC-associated off-target effects). These attributes represent a more potent, efficient, and cost-effective solution for RNA silencing and regulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where is the future? The tendency in our culture – and most, but not all, others – is to compare the body’s movement through space with its passage through time: ahead are the things we are on our way to encounter. We intuit that the past is linked to the space behind and the future to that in front. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-52066-001&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: General&lt;/em&gt; has found that some Western people buck this tendency: those born blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33528&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team led by Luca Rinaldi of the University of Pavia recruited 17 normally sighted local participants and 17 participants of similar age who had early onset or congenital blindness and were unable to recollect any visual memories from their past. All participants were asked to sit at a desk, wear headphones and, if sighted, to wear a blindfold. Their task was to categorise the Italian words they heard over the headphones as quickly as possible as either a future or past word. The words were either adverbs like &lt;i&gt;Prima&lt;/i&gt; (before) and &lt;i&gt;Imminente&lt;/i&gt; (imminent) or verbs like &lt;i&gt;Scrisse&lt;/i&gt; / &lt;i&gt;Scriverà&lt;/i&gt;  (he wrote / he will write).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To categorise, participants had to move their hand forward to press a more distant key, or backward to press a key nearer their body. In one block of the experiment, participants were asked to use the forward response for future words and back for past ones, and in another the reverse mapping was required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent with previous research, the sighted participants responded more quickly in the congruent block (forward = future) than with the incongruent one. But the blind participants showed no such effect, exhibiting similar response speeds across both experimental blocks. This suggests that visual sensory experience is involved in binding of our sense of time to the sagittal (forwards and backwards) plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Rinaldi and her colleagues said , “what has yet to come tends to be visually located in the space in front of us,” and this optical experience, repeated over and over, appears to be what seals in this association until it becomes automatic. A visceral experience, rather than the more abstracted linguistic associations, is key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the use or not of a forward-backward spatial metaphor may have implications for the way that sighted and blind people experience time. For sighted people, past research has shown that events X months in the future feel subjectively closer than an event X months in the past – this makes sense in terms of a forward-backward spatial metaphor considering that the future is something that is always looming (visually) closer, while the past is always retreating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see if the same is true for blind people, Pavia’s team asked their participants to think about real past events and anticipated future ones that were the same amount of time away (e.g. three days ago/three days ahead) and to say how close they felt psychologically. The sighted participants, but not the blind participants, felt that future events were psychologically closer than past events the same duration away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blind people do show some time-space mappings: they, like sighted people, associate past events with the left-hand side of space rather than the right. This may reflect associations built up through reading, as both Western alphabetic text and braille share a left-to-right format. It seems that, whether sighted or blind, our minds use whatever reference points are available to make sense of the dimension that colours everything but can never quite be grasped – the experience by which, in the words of St Augustine, “what is present may proceed to become absent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-52066-001&quot;&gt;The ego-moving metaphor of time relies on visual experience: No representation of time along the sagittal space in the blind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; of March 2018 marks the 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; International Day of Forests. While New Zealand spends the day &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.projectextraordinary.org/&quot;&gt;making sustainability sexy&lt;/a&gt;, and the UN announces the winner of its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/international-day-of-forests/photo-contest/en/&quot;&gt;photo contest&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;BMC Series&lt;/em&gt; blog is celebrating with a roundup of four fantastic &lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/em&gt; publications from 2017-2018. These publications investigate the mechanisms of mixed forests, the relationships between flora and fauna, how plant communities are shaped and species pool estimation methods. The result of all of this research is an increased understanding of our forest ecosystems, and the species which reside within them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-018-0166-z&quot;&gt;Root adaptations in co-cultures of trees – How forests grow and adapt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10043&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10043&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/4-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Camphor Tree&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When forests consist of a mixture of species, rather than just one (a mono-culture), they are more likely to enhance ecological processes and sustainability. This is due to improved soil properties, environmental benefits and complementary resource use. The compromises and foraging strategies of different species determines the dynamics and structure of these plant communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research by Shu &lt;em&gt;et al &lt;/em&gt;investigated the effect on vertical distribution, root biomass, and form in a mixed plantation of Chinese red pine and camphor tree, as well as in their respective monocultures after 10, 24 and 45 years of growth. Their results indicated that the amount each species yields, when grown in a mixed culture, correlates with the amount of interaction and competition between roots below the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also found that the camphor tree invested more carbon into its root biomass in the mixed culture. However, the Chinese red pine adapted to the mixed culture by modifying its vertical distribution and root form flexibility. These different root foraging strategies could help to demonstrate the different forest growth strategies for co-occurring species, as well as contribute to the failure or success of a species over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-017-0146-8&quot;&gt;The relationship between Ryukyu flying-foxes and fig trees in East-Asian subtropical island forests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10044&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10044 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;232&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/5-300x232.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Ryukyu flying-fox. By Koolah (Koolah (talk)による撮影)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fig trees are valuable resources for many animals in a forest as they provide food and shelter for a wide variety of species. Flying-foxes are major consumers, and therefore seed dispersers, of many fig species within forests. Lee &lt;em&gt;et al &lt;/em&gt;studied the Ryukyu flying-fox foraging dispersion and the relationships with tree species composition and fig abundance in the forests of Iriomote island in East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that Ryukyu flying-fox density on the island was positively dependent on the relative density of total figs, particularly the Hauli tree and the Common Red-stem Fig which are both dispersed by bats, including flying-foxes. The Ryukyu bats used these species as their predominant foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also found that intermediate levels of crop sizes of these figs were most adept for the solitary foraging which the Ryukyu flying-foxes undertake. The researchers suggest that if the density and average coverage of these predominant species decrease below a certain level, so to do their chances of attracting and therefore being dispersed by the bats which are attracted to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-017-0143-y&quot;&gt;How ecological processes affect community structure in temperate forests in North Eastern China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10045&quot; style=&quot;width: 211px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10045 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/6-201x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;201&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Forest in Jiaohe, Jilin Province. 西風&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research conducted by Fan &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;seeks to understand the relative importance of different ecological processes in affecting the community structure of a forest. Their study seeks to understand how taxonomic structure is affected by the scale of a forest community; how the taxonomic structure may effect various processes, such as competition between species, at a local scale; whether the effect of local processes on the taxonomic structure varies with forest community scale; and whether these analyses provide similar insights when compared to the use of phylogenetic information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the effect of abiotic factors is greater that the effects of interspecific competition on shaping the local community at nearly every scale. They also found that local processes did influence the taxonomic structures, but their combined effects varied with the scale of the forest community. The taxonomic approach provided similar insights as the phylogenetic approach and consequently, analyzing the taxonomic structures may be a useful tool for communities where suitable phylogenetic data is not available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-017-0155-7&quot;&gt;Estimating Species Pools for a Single Ecological Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10046&quot; style=&quot;width: 267px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10046&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/7-257x300.png&quot; width=&quot;257&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Barro Colorado Island of central Panama. By Photos courtesy of Christian Ziegler.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A species pool is a set of species occurring in a particular region. Research by Shen &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;seeks to develop a statistical method for estimating species pools for a single local community.  With only limited local abundance information, they developed a simple method to estimate the area and richness of a species pool for a local community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research took place in the Barro Colorado Island of central Panama. Their model predicted that the local species pool for the 0.5  km&lt;sup&gt;2 &lt;/sup&gt;plot was almost the whole island. Tree species richness in this pool was estimated at approximately 360. Further statistical tests indicated that the true values of species richness and area size for the hypothetical species pool were covered by the 95% confidence intervals of the true values.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-5446&quot; height=&quot;542&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-21-at-10.55.42-am-1024x542.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is a diet where you can eat chocolate-dipped bacon AND lose weight too good to be true? Part 4 of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/category/gut-brain-axis/&quot;&gt;series on the gut-brain axis&lt;/a&gt;, diet and brain health. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ketogenic (keto) diets have become increasingly popular for achieving rapid weight loss by eating a high fat, very low carbohydrate diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a “normal” diet, glucose is used for energy, so excess fats are used as a secondary fuel and often stored in adipose tissue. In a ketogenic diet, a low intake of carbohydrates induces the body into a state known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/180858.php&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ketosis&lt;/a&gt; to power cells, including neurons. By transitioning the body to burn fat instead of carbohydrates (glucose), weight loss can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ketosis is initiated by the body to help us survive when food intake is low. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prevention.com/health/diabetes/what-are-ketones&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ketones&lt;/a&gt; (or ketone bodies) are made in the liver when the body uses fat for energy, and these can be used as an alternative energy source by cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check that ketones are being produced, urine or blood samples need to be checked daily. However, small shifts in diet through increased carbohydrate consumption can quickly shift the body out of ketosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does ketosis impact the brain?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diabetes.co.uk/blood-glucose/ketosis.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ketosis&lt;/a&gt; increases production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Many anti-anxiety drugs such as benzodiazepines have a calming effect by mimicking the effects of GABA in the brain. So the theory is that increased GABA via ketosis may &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-destress.html&quot;&gt;reduce stress&lt;/a&gt; and anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ketogenic diet has been used since the 1920s diet as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19049574&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a well-established treatment option&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25994046&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;children with epilepsy.&lt;/a&gt; Ketogenic diets reduce seizures in about a third of children who are unresponsive to standard antiepileptic drug therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the mechanism by which ketogenic diets can reduce seizures is not fully understood, the increase in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518023&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GABA may be central to their effectiveness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ketosis boosts and protects brain cells&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that ketones such as beta-hydroxybutyrate may be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK98219/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more efficient fuel&lt;/a&gt; for neurons than glucose. In particular, ketones increase numbers of &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/mitochondria/mitochondria.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; (cellular “power houses”) in neurons helping them to function more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have suggested that the ketogenic diet may reduce neuroinflammation. Ketogenic diets &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05460.x/full&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increase levels of glutathione&lt;/a&gt; – a potent antioxidant. This may protect the brain against oxidative stress that can lead to neuroinflammation and DNA damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ketogenic diets and mental health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory research on rats and mice suggests that ketogenic diets could potentially benefit a number of brain health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mood stabilising effects of ketogenic diets may be useful in the treatment of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11918434&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mania and bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, ketogenic diets can normalize neuronal excitability, increasing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK98219/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;synchronisation of neuron&lt;/a&gt; signalling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High ketone diets fed to transgenic mice that develop pathologies seen in Alzheimer’s disease can normalize some brain changes, but no studies have been conducted with dementia patients yet. Ketogenic diets have been shown to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21130529&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;enhance memory performance&lt;/a&gt; in adults with mild cognitive impairment, a major risk factor for the development of dementia including Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a 2017 review published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357645/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Frontiers of Psychiatry &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; exploring a role for the diet (KD) in treating anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and ADHD in humans found “insufficient evidence for the use of KD in mental disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a long rich history of using the diet to treat epilepsy, it has received little attention with few studies other than case reports, small sample size open studies, and no controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Therapeutic potential of ketogenic diets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the current best advice is: the ketogenic diet &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;SHOULD NOT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; be implemented without the guidance of a medical professional and careful monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal studies suggest that the ketogenic diet may be useful to treat some mental health conditions, but the same studies also report animals maintained on ketogenic diets long-term show signs of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29077838&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although ketogenic diets can alter aspects of neurochemistry that may benefit the brain, neuroscientists still need to pinpoint the mechanisms by which these occur, and robust clinical studies in people are currently lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dietician Joe Leech provides a great overview of the keto diet (and its precursor ‘paleo’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dietvsdisease.org/3-reasons-paleo-is-dead-and-the-ketogenic-diet-is-the-future-of-weight-loss-fads-in-2018/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on his website&lt;/a&gt;). Leech points out that although the diet has health benefits (e.g. epilepsy treatment), the average person is unable to maintain that diet for longer than one or two months. He says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ketogenic diet is a fad diet because it’s unsustainable and you can’t cheat. Even one of the earliest influencers no longer follows the diet because it’s too restrictive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are emotionally sensitive, there are mental defences you can use to help, like reappraising threats as challenges or distracting yourself from the pain. But if you find these mental gymnastics difficult, an alternative approach is to be more strategic about the situations that you find yourself in and the company you keep. Rather than grimacing as you endure yet another storm of emotional angst, make a greater effort to plan ahead and seek out the sunlit places that promise more joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2017.1295922&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Cognition and Emotion&lt;/em&gt; put it: “Situation selection provides an alternative strategy for individuals that does not rely on in-the-moment cognitive resources, and allows reactive and/or less competent individuals to tune their environment in order to promote certain emotional outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33508&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Webb at the University of Sheffield and his colleagues first surveyed 301 volunteers (average age 36; 62 per cent were female) using a newly developed 6-item measure of situation selection. For instance, participants rated how much they “select activities that help me to feel good” and “steer clear of people who put me in a bad mood”. The participants also completed other questionnaires that gauged their happiness and emotional sensitivity, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although purely correlational, the findings supported the researchers’ predictions: overall, participants who scored higher on situation selection also tended to report lower levels of negative mood and depression. Moreover, specifically among emotionally sensitive participants who admitted that they found it difficult to regulate their emotions, situation selection was also associated with greater life satisfaction and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Situation selection sounds obvious but how often can we say that we really think strategically in this way? A lot of the time our plans are based &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/09/we-know-what-will-make-us-happy-why-do-we-watch-tv-instead/&quot;&gt;more on habit&lt;/a&gt; or passive acceptance of other people’s suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To provide a preliminary test of whether encouraging greater situation selection might be a useful strategy, especially for more emotionally vulnerable people, the researchers conducted a second study over a weekend with 125 more volunteers. On a Friday, the participants completed several psychological questionnaires, including tapping their emotional sensitivity. Half the participants were then given the following instruction, designed to foster greater situation selection, and asked to repeat it to themselves three times and fully commit to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;If I am deciding what to do this weekend, then I will select activities that will make me feel good and avoid doing things that will make me feel bad!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on the following Monday, all the participants provided a breakdown of their weekend activities and how they’d felt during each one. People generally engage in a fair amount of situation selection anyway, but the manipulation worked in that those who received the instruction subsequently scored higher on situation selection than the controls who did not receive the instruction. But the main take-away is that participants who received the situation selection instruction experienced more positive mood over the weekend, compared with the controls, and this was especially the case for the more emotionally sensitive participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers concluded: “Notwithstanding the limitations of the studies … the present research underlines the potential for using situation selection to successfully navigate emotional life and suggests several directions for future studies on this relatively under researched emotion regulation strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those future studies might include looking at whether the effectiveness of the situation selection approach is moderated by how good people are at judging how they will feel in different situations, which is what psychologists call “affective forecasting” – something we’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/09/22/we-underestimate-the-benefits-of-nature/&quot;&gt;typically not very good at&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, many of us &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/21/walking-lifts-your-mood-even-when-you-dont-expect-it-to/&quot;&gt;underestimate how good we’ll feel after doing some exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More awkward issues will also need to be dealt with, such as how to balance the aim of reducing people’s emotional discomfort in the moment against their longer-term goals, which might necessitate navigating emotionally challenging situations. Indeed, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy involves addressing safety behaviours (think of the socially anxious person who avoids public speaking) that a person uses to reduce their emotional discomfort, but which in the long-term can exacerbate their emotional vulnerabilities or hinder their ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other sceptical readers may agree that situation selection sounds like an appealing approach, but wonder what to do about life getting in the way – first they’ve got that meeting with their grumpy boss then a visit with their ill parent then they must pick the kids up from school then make dinner, then ….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2017.1295922&quot;&gt;Situation selection is a particularly effective emotion regulation strategy for people who need help regulating their emotions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For tweens and early teens, the rise in time spent on Snapchat, WhatsApp and other social media is really quite dramatic. Our new study set out to look at patterns of behavior among 10-15-year-olds in the UK, and their levels of well-being, to see if all this time spent online was having a detrimental impact on their mental health.  We found that teenage girls are by far the highest users of social media, and those who are using it for more than an hour a day also have more well-being problems in later teen years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used the youth participants’ data from the UK household longitudinal study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;Understanding Society&lt;/a&gt;, following almost 10,000 young people from diverse backgrounds, across the whole country, over 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten percent of ten-year-old girls reported spending one to three hours a day (compared with 7 percent of boys) and this increased to 43 percent of girls at age 15 (and 31 percent of boys).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked the young people to report on how much time they spent on social media on a ‘normal school day.’  A few reported no internet access or no time spent at all, but some were on it four hours or more.  Ten percent of ten-year-old girls reported spending one to three hours a day (compared with 7 percent of boys) and this increased to 43 percent of girls at age 15 (and 31 percent of boys).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two measures of well-being were assessed for these young people. The first was a combined score of questions that asked about satisfaction with schoolwork, friends, family, appearance, school and life as a whole. The second measure was based on a well-established questionnaire which asked the young people about their social and emotional difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At age 10, girls who interacted on social media for an hour or more on a school day had worse levels of well-being compared to girls who had lower levels of social media interaction. Additionally, these girls with higher social media interaction at age 10 were more likely to experience more social and emotional difficulties as they got older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both boys and girls, levels of happiness decreased between the ages of 10 and 15, but the decrease among girls was greater than that of boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes girls different?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Girls may participate in more comparisons of their own lives with those of the people they are friends with or follow. Viewing filtered or photo-shopped images and mostly positive posts may lead to feelings of inadequacy and poorer well-being. Girls may also feel more pressure to develop and maintain a social media presence than boys. Social media presence requires constant updating and having friends share or like their content. If their perceived popularity decreases over time, there may be a resultant increase in social and emotional difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boys, on the other hand, are much more likely to participate in gaming than social media, which is not covered by our study. Thus boys’ levels of well-being may be more related to their gaming and skill level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can we do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can be done to help protect young people from the potential damage to their mental health? Social media interaction does not appear to be a short-lived phenomenon.  The recent Children’s Commissioner for England’s report, &lt;em&gt;Life in Likes&lt;/em&gt;, suggests imploring social media platforms to check underage use and better preparing children for life in a digital age. The recommendations did not discuss potential gender differences, but the findings from our study suggest that boys and girls can have different emotional and well-being responses to high levels of social media interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have also been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/31/facebook-urged-tell-children-spend-long-online/&quot;&gt;calls&lt;/a&gt; for the technology industry to look at built-in time limits. Our study really backs this up – increasing time online is strongly associated with a decline in well-being in young people, especially girls.  Young people need access to the internet for homework, for watching TV and to keep in touch with their friends, of course,  but do they really need to spend one, two, three or four hours chatting, sharing and comparing on social media every school day?&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/03/THank-you_blog-image-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To all our Reviewers, Guest Editors and Editorial Board members, thank you! 2018 marks the fourth year that we formally and publicly acknowledge our community of reviewers and editors for sustaining public access to rigorous peer-reviewed research, enhancing our journals’ abilities to communicate the work of researchers and communities, and inspiring the work of our staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Passion to Go Beyond &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our contributor community selflessly guides papers through the editorial process and provides feedback to authors. Many also actively stand up for Open Access, open data and Open Science as they attend conferences, debate with colleagues or share research via social media, email or even, yes, conversation! Our reviewers and editors devote time and energy to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.plos.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Collections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.plos.org/s/plos-medicine-special-issues&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Special Issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/11/plos-channels-discover-explore-insight/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Channels&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005355&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Editorials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006850&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Perspectives&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/scied/2018/03/08/is-a-little-science-a-dangerous-thing/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/category/Meet-the-Editors/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interviews&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005729&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;career advice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, educational material and more to enrich the primary literature, provide context and engage the public. These endeavours help make PLOS a unique place to publish and for that we are greatly appreciative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who volunteer their services to PLOS, and the greater scientific community, are more than just dedicated scientists: they share an entrepreneurial spirit as we advance scholarly communication with requirements for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/orcid&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ORCID iDs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for corresponding authors, implementation of CRediT for &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/02/guidelines-transparency-for-author-contributions/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;author contributions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, community engagement for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/12/advancing-evaluation-dora/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;improved evaluation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, integration of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006448&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;preprint Editors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and experimentation with software development. Throughout all of these innovations, some successful (108,000 ORCID entries in our system uniquely identify authors to ensure complete and accurate recognition of work, regardless of changes to name or institution) and others less so, PLOS continues to be, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/12/ceo-letter-to-the-community-mudditt/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in the words of our CEO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, an organization “willing to take risks in order to best serve scientific communities.” We have tremendous appreciation for Reviewers, Guest Editors and Editorial Board Members who are confident to travel the road with us toward a world of readily discoverable, freely available, thoroughly reliable and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/licenses-and-copyright&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fully reusable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; research outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Impressive Community Workload&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing our quest for transparency in the publishing process, we include the number of newly submitted and published research articles brought to the public in 2017 in each of the seven journals’ thank you articles. We released this information for the first time &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/03/thank-you-from-plos/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and will continue to do so as it provides additional insight and appreciation for the workload of our reviewers and editors. That workload in 2017 supported publication of more than 23,000 research articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our global network of more than 74,000 reviewers and 7,200 editors ensures that Research Articles, Perspectives, Editorials and more achieve the highest quality possible. The more than 15 million article views per month (on average) this past year hints at the enthusiasm that PLOS reviewers and editors share, for science and scientists. Enthusiasm is not enough, however. This geographically diverse contributor community also shares a commitment to responsible and fair examination of the science, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/ethical-publishing-practice&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ethics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/best-practices-in-research-reporting&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reporting guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;data availability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and journal publication criteria associated with each submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efforts to Ease Process and Enrich Training &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve listened to our reviewer and editor communities who want more training, especially Early Career Researchers. In response we developed the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://reviewers.plos.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Reviewer Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, to provide detailed, journal-agnostic peer review guidance from experienced researchers, staff editors, Editorial Board members, and other reviewers. The Reviewer Center is still under development, so we encourage you to take a look around and let us know what you find useful or missing via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://surveys.plos.org/s3/reviewer-center-contact&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;feedback form&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the PLOS Reviewer Center anyone can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the basics of peer review and get helpful tips for handling reviewer tasks, from accepting a review invitation to completing a review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access video, templates, checklists and other customized tools for reviewers&lt;/li&gt;

(2018)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - click image to enlarge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, they're not. They're really not. They're “everywhere” to me, because I've been listening to &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depeche_Mode&quot; title=&quot;Depeche Mode&quot;&gt;Black Celebration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. How did I go from “death is everywhere” to “universal linguistic decoders are everywhere”? I don't imagine this particular semantic leap has occurred to anyone before. Actually, the association travelled in the opposite direction, because the original title of this piece was Decoders Are Everywhere.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  {I was listening to the record weeks ago, the silly title of the post reminded me of this, and the semantic association was remote.}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is linguistic meaning in all its idiosyncratic glory, a space for infinite semantic vectors that are unexpected and novel. My rambling is also an excuse to &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;not &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;start out by saying, oh my god, what were you thinking with a title like, &lt;i&gt;Toward a universal decoder of linguistic meaning from brain activation&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03068-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pereira et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;). Does the word “toward” absolve you from what such a sage, all-knowing clustering algorithm would actually entail? And of course, “universal” implies applicability to every human language, not just English. How about, &lt;i&gt;Toward a better clustering algorithm (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Global Vectors for Word Representation&quot;&gt;GloVe vectors&lt;/a&gt;) for inferring meaning&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt; from the distribution of voxels&lt;/i&gt;, as determined by an n=16 database of brain activation elicited by reading English sentences?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it's unfair (and inaccurate) to suggest that the linguistic decoder can decipher a meandering train of thought when given a specific neural activity pattern. Therefore, I do not want to take anything away from what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03068-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pereira et al. (2018)&lt;/a&gt; have achieved in this paper. They say: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Our work goes substantially beyond prior work in three key ways. First, we develop a novel sampling procedure for selecting the training stimuli so as to cover the entire semantic space. This comprehensive sampling of possible meanings in training the decoder maximizes generalizability to potentially any new meaning.”&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;“Second, we show that although our decoder is trained on a limited set of individual word meanings, it can robustly decode meanings of sentences represented as a simple average of the meanings of the content words. ... To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst demonstration of generalization from single-word meanings to meanings of sentences.”&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;“Third, we test our decoder on two independent imaging datasets, in line with current emphasis in the ﬁeld on robust and replicable science. The materials (constructed fully independently of each other and of the materials used in the training experiment) consist of sentences about a wide variety of topics—including abstract ones—that go well beyond those encountered in training.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it would take me days to adequately pore over the methods, and even then my understanding would be only cursory. The heavy lifting would need to be done by experts in linguistics, unsupervised learning, and neural decoding models. But until then...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Death is everywhere&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are flies on the windscreen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt; For a start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt; Reminding us&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt; We could be torn apart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tonight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;---Depeche Mode, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/depechemode/flyonthewindscreen.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fly on the Windscreen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnote&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Well, they &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; super popular right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reference&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pereira F, Lou B, Pritchett B, Ritter S, Gershman SJ, Kanwisher N, Botvinick M, Fedorenko E.

		<updated>2018-03-19T12:00:12+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Often the biggest existential distress that we carry is the idea that no-one will remember us when we are gone—initially we know that our friends and family will hold who we are, but after a generation, these people are likely gone too. At the end of life, the pressure to leave an unquestionably relevant legacy can be crippling for people, particularly for young people. When coupled with the limited energy that people have when they are unwell, the very nature of what people expect to achieve in the world shrinks, and the really important pieces come into focus.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When time is seen to be limited, every moment can take on a weight that has never before been experienced. Some of these expectations come from within and some externally, but regardless of their origin they can be paralyzing for the young person facing their mortality, particularly when unwell. Culturally, there are multiple references as to what ‘dying young’ is meant to mean and most refer to extraordinary and often unobtainable expectations. For instance, members of the ‘27 club’ (celebrities who die on or before their 27th birthday) and notable cancer-related concepts around ‘bucket lists’ and works of fiction (e.g., The Fault in Our Stars). Most young people, particularly those who are dying, do not have the capacity or the options to engage in an extraordinary feat, they can become overwhelmed and paralyzed by what they are ‘meant to be doing’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think I have well and truly missed my opportunity for greatness, I now just want enough energy to spend time with my friends. Maybe even go to the pub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~18-year-old male&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, as is the case with many things in life, simple and small are the gestures and moments which are the most meaningful, with huge projects and adventures feeling too overwhelming and out of the grasp of someone with limited energy and resources. As such, the fantasy of what something may have looked and felt like, had they have been well, is a much more satisfying space for them to sit with. Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/13/how-attachment-and-parenting-style-affect-adult-relationships/&quot;&gt;relationships&lt;/a&gt; become much more meaningful, as do the simple things that are taken away through the treatment process, like being able to sit in the sun or go to the pub with a friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘I had been playing online games with him for years, and I thought that I would never meet him now. He made it happen though.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~19-year-old male &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young patients can be bombarded with well-intentioned suggestions about what they ‘need’ to do, including making future legacy-based activities, such as leaving cards for each of their younger sibling’s birthdays, video journals of their &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2013/12/13/overcoming-trauma-by-dealing-with-death/&quot;&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, or chronicling how they feel about all the people in their world. Although these are good ideas, they are emotionally and physically difficult to manage with limited resources. Patients need to be feeling very resilient and well before attempting any of these things with most being abandoned due to the confronting nature of conceptualizing the world without them present in it. It is a difficult ask for anyone to be able to take the relatively abstract idea of the world continuing following your own death; this does not change for young people and, in some ways, it is even more challenging due to their pervasive &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2018/01/21/brain-evolution-as-a-path-to-the-gods/&quot;&gt;sense of self&lt;/a&gt;, even in the face of very real threats to their mortality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘I could clean out my room, and all of my stuff. But then I think, well I don’t want to do it really, and it’s not like it’s going to be my problem.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~23-year-old male&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way that young people respond to being presented with a very limited life expectancy can vary tremendously. Some may stick their head firmly in the sand and refuse to discuss or conceptualize anything about what may happen in the lead-up to their death, or following. Others will organize everything about the end of their lives, including where they want to die, how alert they want to be, as well as what will happen following their death—such as where their belongings go and how they want to be remembered. For most people in this situation, in an existential sense, almost everything is out of control, the disease will do what it does, the pain is what it is, and they are an observer to the things happening in their bodies. The things that people can control is what they talk about, how much they talk about it, and who they talk about it too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because death, dying, and legacy are not being talked about, does not mean that it is not in the consciousness and thoughts of the person pondering their own end. Instead, it may be that they have done as much thinking and talking about it as they need to do; it is often these patients that have very well-considered plans about what they want to happen as they deteriorate and the decisions that must be made about their care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lower your music, you’re upsetting other passengers.” Without social sanction, society frays at the edges. But what drives someone to intervene against bad behaviour? One cynical view is that it appeals to those who want to feel better about themselves through scolding others. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjso.12246?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; putting this to the test in &lt;i&gt;British Journal of Social Psychology&lt;/i&gt; has found that interveners are rather different in character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33501&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French-Austrian collaboration team led by Alexandrina Moisuc conducted a series of studies asking participants to read hypothetical scenarios involving anti-social behaviour such as someone tearing up posters, spitting on the pavement, or throwing used batteries into a flower pot in a shared yard. The use of hypothetical scenarios and intentions can be considered a limitation of the study, as this may not truly reflect real-world action; on the other hand, it allowed the researchers to investigate a broader range of situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked how they would respond, on scales that ranged from total inaction through sighing to addressing the transgressor mildly or aggressively. They also rated how morally outraged they felt about the transgression, with higher ratings correlating strongly with a desire to intervene. In addition, participants rated themselves on their personality and other traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moisuc’s team thought that one candidate personality profile of an intervener could be the “Bitter Complainer”: a person with low self-esteem who uses hostility towards others to feel better about themselves. There is some limited past evidence to support this view: for instance, experiments that make people feel more insecure lead them to judge others more harshly. Social sanctions are effectively a form of “altruistic punishment” (because they are for the wider social good) and some research on punishment in economic games shows that low-empathy individuals are more willing to punish others. On the other hand, the researchers anticipated that perhaps people with a personality more akin to the archetype of a  strong leader might be more inclined to step in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moisuc and her colleagues found that traits like self-esteem and low levels of social capital – the “bitter” components – and also traits associated with lashing out, such as aggressiveness, poor emotional regulation, and social dominance orientation (seeing the world as hierarchical and so potentially wanting to put others down to keep yourself up), had no, or even a negative, relationship with preparedness to act. This was true in student samples in Austria and France, and a further French non-student sample; in total around 1100 participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personality factors that were associated with an intention to speak out included extraversion, confidence, persistence, being good at regulating emotions, valuing altruism and being comfortable expressing opinions. Those who already felt socially accepted, and happy to take on social responsibility – such as voting and paying taxes – were also more likely to say they would intervene. This is a very different picture from the Bitter Complainer. These traits are related to successfully managing difficult situations in teams, and to taking the risk to whistle-blow on organisations. Accordingly, Moisuc’s group characterises this as the “Well-adjusted Leader.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data also indicated a connection between willingness to intervene and holding  anti-prejudicial attitudes: lower “social dominance” was associated with speaking up, both in the more generic scenarios and a subset that involved racist or sexist behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be convenient to explain away other people’s pro-social behaviour as selfishly motivated, as that justifies our own inaction. These findings undermine that negative interpretation, suggesting that those who intervene are those well-adjusted to deal with difficult encounters, and a sense of responsibility toward their environment and the greater good. This is a call to examine ourselves: what do we need to set right in our own lives so that we can defend the world we truly want?&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/03/TBI_feature-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging is an important tool for clinicians in diagnosing patients who have suffered from traumatic brain injury (TBI). Brain imaging techniques generally focus on either structure or function. With TBI, the focus is typically on the extent of structural brain damage, which is often assessed using computed tomography (CT).  Structural brain scans provide information regarding the severity of TBI, which is largely determined by the extent of damage. But, what about measures of brain function?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another brain imaging technique that has become a crucial instrument for scientists trying to learn more about how the brain works is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). fMRI allows the examination of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.open.edu/openlearn/body-mind/health/health-sciences/how-fmri-works&quot;&gt;human brain function&lt;/a&gt; in a way that is not invasive and, in contrast to a CT scan, does not involve radiation. With the help of math and statistics, brain mappers are able to measure brain activity patterns. But, can fMRI also be used as a diagnostic tool for TBI? Because (a) no two brain injuries are identical and (b) the way in which brain injuries affect cognition and brain function is highly variable, the current picture of fMRI use as a diagnostic tool for TBI is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, new tools and techniques have recently been developed that allow for the assessment of brain function in TBI, as well as other types of brain injury. Using fMRI could thereby add a whole new dimension to our understanding of TBI and TBI recovery. To get a better sense of the present state of fMRI applications with TBI, we have asked three TBI experts the following question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Given that the utility of fMRI is still relatively undefined in the clinical realm, how do you see modern neuroimaging techniques playing a role in TBI in the future, beyond conventional scanning (CT, structural MRI)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Research Facility at Brigham Young University&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I believe that there is tremendous potential for clinical applications of fMRI in TBI, but not as standalone, independent metrics of brain function. Given the uniqueness of each individual and the heterogeneity of TBI, no two brain injuries are ever identical. As such, it is unlikely that there would ever be a universal fMRI signal that would consistently differentiate or be influenced by brain injury. However, fMRI activation paradigms in response to a cognitive task can probe neural system integrity, which can also be assessed through resting state functional connectivity mapping. Integrating this information with a dynamic structural imaging approach that takes advantage of multiple methods to assess volume, thickness, and shape along with lesion analysis would provide both structural and functional information about the brain injury. Additionally, these anatomical or functionally defined networks could then be the basis for using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to explore tract integrity between regions of interest within the network.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Department of Psychology, Penn State University&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“FMRI has provided previously unavailable opportunities to advance our understanding of the organization of human brain functioning at the systems level. There has been meaningful extension of work in the cognitive neurosciences to understand plasticity in brain disorders with several important themes emerging from fMRI work in TBI (e.g., neural recruitment, “compensation”). By contrast, after nearly two decades of fMRI research designed to establish diagnostic biomarkers in various forms of mild TBI, no reliable neural signature for injury has emerged. I anticipate that future work in this area will be met with continued failure due to individual differences and the lack of clinical specificity in task-based fMRI findings.  More recent integration of network neuroscience into fMRI research has transformed the landscape of TBI research with goals now directed toward understanding injury-induced plasticity in large-scale networks (e.g., default mode network). While in its infancy, research that couples network science with brain stimulation techniques (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation) represents at least one possible avenue for functional MRI to contribute meaningfully to clinical intervention in TBI. To date, however, fMRI has primarily contributed to basic science and its potential to advance clinical diagnostics and intervention in TBI remains largely unrealized.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neuroimaging.medicine.iu.edu/people/corefaculty/brenna-cathleen-mcdonald-psy-d-mba/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brenna McDonald&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associate Professor of Radiology and Imaging Sciences,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Center for Neuroimaging at Indiana University School of Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“FMRI and advanced structural MR techniques such as DTI have come into increasing use to study behavioral and cognitive changes after TBI. In addition to being used to explore the underlying structural and functional neural correlates of TBI, such techniques have the potential to help guide treatment approaches. For example, fMRI has been used to study the neural correlates of symptom reduction following pharmacological and behavioral treatments for cognitive symptoms after TBI. The understanding gained can be used to further refine treatments. For example, in mild TBI/concussion, use of imaging can help validate proposed screening and diagnostic tools, such as sideline assessments, cognitive or behavioral instruments, biomechanical force metrics, sensory or vestibular testing, or blood biomarkers. Demonstration of a correlation between such measures and imaging variables, such as task-related fMRI activation, resting cerebral blood flow, or structural or functional connectivity, in concert with complementary data such as cognitive assessment and postconcussive symptom measurement, could provide the evidence needed to demonstrate utility of such screening or diagnostic tools. More thorough knowledge of these interactions will help advance the goals of personalized medicine initiatives by improving prediction of injury risk, outcome, and treatment response.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside structural brain imaging techniques that are routinely used in TBI, fMRI may provide a better understanding of brain function in TBI patients. By combining structural, functional, and cognitive assessments, clinicians may evaluate individual cases in a more specific way and adapt their treatments accordingly. After all, TBI is a very heterogeneous condition and impacts brain recovery differently in different people. This heterogeneity may become more manageable once we reach a better understanding of brain function. At the very least, fMRI offers new hope that treatments could be tailored more towards the individual. If and how fMRI fits toward this goal of “personalized medicine” will become clearer in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Live life to the fullest.”&lt;br /&gt;
“Celebrate life.”&lt;br /&gt;
“Carpe diem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard them all. But what if I don’t feel like it? What if I’m having a lousy brain day, restricted to a darkened room with a blinding &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2013/05/02/do-not-ignore-a-headache/&quot;&gt;headache&lt;/a&gt;, and seizing the day is not an option? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have clusters of malformed blood vessels called cavernous angiomas in my brain. Two of them bled, turning my life upside down with seizures and other symptoms. A few months later, I underwent resection surgeries to prevent future bleeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surgeries wreaked additional havoc—headaches, seizures, fatigue, short attention span and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2011/03/07/plan-a-cognitive-and-memory-enhancement-program/&quot;&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt;, vertigo and poor balance, as well as severe depression. During the first couple of months post-surgery, my world revolved around my recovery. I was in survival mode, often fearful, often feeling alone. On good days, I took it one day at a time. On bad days (and there were many), I slid back three steps for every half step forward. There wasn’t much I could seize on those days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year into my recovery, I finally had the wherewithal to join the Angioma Alliance, an online support group for angioma patients. Through the website, members connect with each other, sharing war stories, sometimes asking questions but more often seeking reminders that we are not alone in our struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us cavernous angioma patients live with an ax hanging over (or inside) our heads. There’s always a chance of a bleed, especially from an angioma that has bled before. Angiomas can cause symptoms even when they haven’t bled. A resected (surgically removed) angioma can grow back. Many of us who have the familial form of the disease have many angiomas and can generate new ones throughout our entire lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of us who are good candidates for &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/10/04/in-and-out-of-the-abyss-depression-after-brain-surgery/&quot;&gt;brain surgery&lt;/a&gt;, where the benefits outweigh the risks of surgery, are considered the lucky ones. One of the members of the Alliance has an angioma located in her brain stem. Unfortunately, it is inoperable. My friend is scared of the very real possibility of a bleed causing her heart to stop beating or to suddenly take away her ability to breathe. Her fears often paralyze her, preventing her from taking life by the horns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fears emerge when a new symptom appears or a new manifestation of an old one emerges: is it a sign of a new bleed? Is a new angioma forming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, more than ten years since the surgeries, my good days outnumber the bad. Most of the time, my fears hide beneath the surface, and when they do come out of hiding, they rarely paralyze me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should be able to seize the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have several friends who are breast cancer survivors. Sheryl, at the age of seventy, learned to fly-fish and dragon boat. She paddles competitively and participates in national and international dragon boat races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darlene didn’t even jog before her diagnosis; now she runs marathons. She rarely traveled out of town, and now she travels frequently and extensively. She’s tried sky-diving, attends glitzy shows, and throws frequent pool parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are these inspiring activities the only ways that count as living life to the fullest? Should I seize and celebrate life like my breast cancer survivor friends?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have absolutely no interest in sky-diving or learning to fish. Glitzy shows have never been my thing, and I do my best to avoid parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it a matter of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/29/personality-changes-after-deep-brain-stimulation/&quot;&gt;personality&lt;/a&gt;? Perhaps if I were as gregarious as my friends, I would live more like them. They may not have been as daring pre-cancer, but were they as gregarious as they are now? Perhaps they only developed that side of their personalities after the challenges of treatment and recovery. Was I supposed to have become more outgoing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having had to take a crash course in asking for help and admitting my weaknesses, I have become better at connecting with people. I’m not as extroverted as Sheryl and Darlene, but I am more outgoing than I was pre-surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I’m not a party-goer. My difficulties processing high volumes of sensory input keep me from activities such as sporting events and parties that involve large crowds, loud noises, and garish colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it’s a matter of energy or lack thereof. Much of the time, I struggle through debilitating fatigue and have nothing left for celebrations. When I am overtired, my deficits are exacerbated and vertigo returns in full force, my balance is precarious, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2008/05/16/adult-attention-deficit-disorder-a-real-concern/&quot;&gt;attention span&lt;/a&gt; is that of a gnat, I have trouble accessing vocabulary, and my headaches are crippling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to pace myself. I take one day at a time, shuffling through the bad brain days, enjoying the good days. Is that the best I can hope for? Is that seizing the day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like my cancer-surviving friends, my life has changed dramatically. I travel much more than in my pre-injury days, to Colorado and New York, Israel, and Mexico. Always, wherever I go, I must seek out quiet spots to recover and regroup. But once my inner traffic jams clear up, I join in the fun, though at a slower pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have more passion in my life—it comes to light in my teaching, in my writing, and in my need to make a difference in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a few months of my surgeries, I moved into a more central neighborhood. I am within walking distance of shops and restaurants. I no longer drive everywhere. My awareness, both of myself and the world around me, has grown; I am more in tune with my fellow human beings, better able to interact with my surroundings. I live more quietly. I take leisurely walks, stopping to absorb my surroundings. I play with my grand-dog, enjoying his antics. Life is harder but more fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could my way also count as a celebration of life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a lovely day outside. I am well rested after a rare night of decent sleep. I slip on my jacket and head out for a stroll along the nearby river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This diem is definitely calling out to be carped, my way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many training programmes for psychotherapists and counsellors include a mandatory personal therapy component – as well as learning about psychotherapeutic theories and techniques, and practising being a therapist, the trainee must also spend time in therapy themselves, in the role of a client. Indeed, the British Psychological Society’s own Division of Counselling Psychology stipulates that Counselling Psychology trainees must undertake 40 hours of personal therapy as part of obtaining their qualification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it like for trainees to complete their own mandatory therapy? A new &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/capr.12162/abstract&quot;&gt;meta-synthesis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Counselling and Psychotherapy Research&lt;/em&gt; is the first to combine all previously published qualitative findings addressing this question. The trainees’ accounts suggest that the practice offers many benefits, but that it also has “hindering effects” that raise “serious ethical considerations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33484&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Murphy and his colleagues at the University of Nottingham conducted a systematic review of the literature and found 16 relevant qualitative studies up to 2016, involving 139 psychologists, counsellors and psychotherapists in training who had undertaken compulsory personal psychotherapy as part of their course requirements. Most the studies involved interviews with the trainees about their experiences; the others were based on trainees’ written accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murphy and his team identified six themes in the trainees’ descriptions. Some were positive. The trainees talked about how therapy had &lt;strong&gt;helped their personal and professional development&lt;/strong&gt;, for example raising their self-awareness, emotional resilience and confidence in their skills. Personal psychotherapy also offered them a powerful form of &lt;strong&gt;experiential learning&lt;/strong&gt; in which they got to see for themselves how concepts like transference play out in therapy, and they obviously experienced what it is like to be a client. They also learned about “reflexivity” – how to reflect on themselves and the way their own “self material” contributes to the dynamics of therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another positive theme was &lt;strong&gt;therapeutic gains&lt;/strong&gt; – some trainees saw their personal therapy as a form of “explicit stress management”; they said it helped them work through issues from their past; and also helped them to become their &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/08/22/there-is-no-such-thing-as-the-true-self-but-its-still-a-useful-psychological-concept/&quot;&gt;authentic selves&lt;/a&gt;, and accept their strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the remaining themes were more concerning. The first – &lt;strong&gt;Do no harm&lt;/strong&gt; – referred to the fact that many trainees spoke of the stress and anguish that the therapy caused them, and the way it affected their personal relationships. In some cases this left them feeling unable to cope with their client work (in which they were the therapist). Another theme – “&lt;strong&gt;Justice&lt;/strong&gt;” – summarises the burden that trainees felt the mandatory therapy imposed on  them, in terms of time and expense, and the pressure of being assessed and of their lost autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, under the theme “&lt;strong&gt;Integrity&lt;/strong&gt;“, the researchers said some trainees talked about how their therapist was unprofessional, yet it was difficult to change them; that they felt coerced into therapy and that the mandatory nature of it prevented them from truly opening up – in fact there was a sense of some trainees simply jumping through hoops in a functional way to complete their course requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murphy and his team end their paper calling on regulatory and training institutions to consider the issues raised by their findings. Although the “hindering factors” they identified raise serious ethical issues, they believe that it may be possible to address them: “We envisage that programmes that attend to the points raised in this study will provide the best learning opportunities, compared with courses that do not regularly critically reflect upon, assess, and evaluate mandatory psychotherapy within the course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/capr.12162/abstract&quot;&gt;A systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative research into mandatory personal psychotherapy during training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h4&gt;The fragility of our minds and theirs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/240/1*62edE9h03IYAwBShcOlVTw@2x.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Well with a title like that, what other picture could I possibly use? Credit: Pixabay&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have fragile minds. Disorders of thought affect a large proportion of the population of rich countries at any one time; each person in these countries has an uncomfortably high probability of having at least one of these disorders of thought in their lifetime, peaking in early adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These disorders come in many flavours, with many labels. Depression is common, as is anxiety. Addictions and compulsions too. More extreme are the darkness of obsessive compulsive disorders and the fragmentation of schizophrenia. They are uniquely human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unknown is if they will remain uniquely human. Research in artificial intelligence is making spectacular progress; for many researchers, this progress is along the path to developing human-like general AI. This leads to a troubling thought: will a human-like AI inherit human-like disorders of thought?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For disorders of movement that originate in the brain, we have some understanding of what happens: specific neurons get damaged, and specific movement problems result. In Parkinson’s disease, losing a small collection of dopamine neurons in the midbrain seems yoked to when tremors or difficulty in movement appear. In Huntington’s disease, loss of neurons in the striatum is directly linked to the disease’s tell-tale involuntary movements and spasms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disorders of thought have yet to yield to simple mechanistic explanations. They seem rather a disorder of very large networks of neurons. Some might object that most disorders of thought have a mechanistic explanation, as they are disorders of neuromodulators – because most of their treatments change the amount of one or more neuromodulators within the brain. But all this tells us is that they have to be a network-wide problem, for neuromodulators are released all over the brain. And, as their name implies, neuromodulators change, but do not cause, the transmission of information between neurons. Even if changes in neuromodulation are at the root of thought disorders, their effect is played out in how they change the way neurons talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear why disorders of thought even exist. Are they inevitable in any sufficiently complex brain? If so, is this inevitability restricted to biology?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How we answer that question depends on whether disorders of thought are due to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) inherent flaws in biology,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) the effects of culture, or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3) the inherent side-effects of large-scale complex networks of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are not mutually exclusive, as we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inherent flaws in biology is the medical explanation. Brains are bags of cells, each of which is a bag of chemicals, and sits in a soup of other chemicals. A flaw in those chemicals, or the bags in which they sit, is a natural first target for how thought disorders arise. But innately flawed biology alone is unlikely to be the explanation. Such flaws would be selected against by evolution. Fish that can’t face another day of swimming won’t survive. Genetically inherited forms of thought disorders are rare. Instead, small differences in many genes can increase or decrease the probability of experiencing a thought disorder in a lifetime. Something then tips the balance from a probability to a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thought disorders could thus be an inherent consequence of our cultures. Such a consequence could be the physical products we make: a pesticide, a solvent, a drug. The presence of particular manufactured chemicals in our environments has been linked to the increased probability of a few brain disorders; but thought disorders have apparently ancient origins, predating much of our industrial effluence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more likely consequence of our culture is its sheer complexity. A well-rehearsed argument is that we are using our brains outside the niche in which they evolved. Our brains are subject to constant stressors in a society vastly bigger than they evolved within. Of hundreds of things to do, hundreds of things we are aware of, but have no individual control over: wars, famine, disease, climate change. Chronic stress affects the wiring of neurons, and changes how they respond to inputs. In this scenario, the genetic differences that increase or decrease the chances of a thought disorder are played out in the resilience they confer on our neuronal networks to these culturally driven changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a common factor to all disorders of thought is that they arise in the most complex network of neurons on Earth. We have 17 billion neurons in our cortex; no other animal comes close. We like to give our cortex credit for our apparently unique combination of talents, for language and writing and maths; for creativity and cooking. Indeed theories for how our cortex got to this outlier size see it as either cause or consequence of culture: either that such large, adaptable networks allow us to form large social groups, and develop language; or that forming large social groups and developing language drove the evolution of the largest cortex on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a small part of cortex dedicated to the understanding and production of spoken language. Another part to written language. Loss of knowing how to speak sentences &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615573520&quot;&gt;does not mean losing how to write the same sentences&lt;/a&gt;. Written language is an exceptionally recent event, too recent to have evolved a dedicated brain region to process it; that we have a brain region that deals with writing shows how our cortex is an adaptable, versatile machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And therein lies the problem. Cortex is endlessly rewiring as new skills are learnt; as new memories are formed; as new knowledge is acquired; and as it continues to develop into early adulthood. In all that rewiring, there are chances of associations being formed between things that can’t exist, giving hallucinations; or associations that could exist, but are exceptionally unlikely, giving obsessive thoughts; or associations of bad outcomes with innocuous things, giving depression or anxiety. That the rewiring will lead to the activation of one set of neurons accidentally activating another set that are not relevant right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adaptability is not just rewiring. Cortex predicts what is about to happen. It predicts the next word in a sentence. It predicts when a sound follows a bright flash in the sky. And these predictions can grow too strong. They can write over the information from our senses. They can create events that are not happening, so hallucinating; can predict event that will never happen, depressing us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We seem to be the only species with a widespread and many-faceted array of things that can go wrong with our minds. We are also the only species with a 17 billion neuron cortex, containing trillions of connections. The two are plausibly linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrast this with the current state of AI. We have witnessed remarkable progress. But at root we are still at the stage where one AI agent learns just one thing. A network learns to translate one language into another; or to classify a specific set of images; or to play Go or chess or draughts. While we have now reached the point where the same architecture, the same set of algorithms, may be used to solve different problems, the individual AI agent is still only learning one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans learn chess and Go and draughts; and learn multiple languages; and learn to paint. And learn sequences of events, predicting outcomes, good or bad. And do all this with one cortex. Which deals with many different types of learnt information, and many different uses of that information. In one densely complex network, ripe for malfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This line of argument suggests a “general” AI is not possible, or at best inadvisable. It suggests that a sufficiently complex network able to exhibit human-like abilities – to adapt to each new task, to make predictions, to learn, and to form memories – would also exhibit human-like frailties. That such AI would exhibit a range of disorders of thought, would have psychoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retort would be that, as we construct such AI ourselves, then we can engineer the networks we build to not fall prey to these frailties. That retort assumes we will have sufficient understanding of how these disorders arise in order to engineer around them. Patently, we do not have that at the moment, nor any indication that understanding is coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more refined retort may be that we need not follow the evolved brain slavishly, that we can find ways to have a complex network that can learn and do many different tasks without inheriting the design flaws of biology. In particular, that human disorders of thought seem dependent on neuromodulators, and AIs do not have them. One problem with this view is that it inherently believes neuromodulators are not doing computation. But it is all computation. A neuromodulator like serotonin changes the state of brain, by changing the strengths of connections between neurons. Neuromodulators have this role in both the tiniest nervous systems on Earth and in our cortex. We ought to assume they are necessary for being intelligent. It seems likely that AI will need something that mimics neuromodulation if it is to reach for general intelligence. For it is how real networks of neurons can be adaptively sculpted to change the problem at hand, by changing how they interact, both briefly and permanently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another problem with this view is that many AI systems already use neuromodulation. Dopamine neurons change their firing to signal the difference between the outcome you expected and the outcome you got. This is the “prediction error” at the heart of many of the most spectacular recent AI demonstrations. It can drive wrong associations between actions and outcomes in AI networks just as easily as in neuronal networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But say we did understand how these disorders come about. Then if they arise from anything other than pure inherent flaws in the biology, if they arise from our culture or are inherent side-effects of large densely-connected networks or both, then they cannot be engineered around. Such advanced AI would exist within our culture – one that is disengaged from it would not, by definition, be the mooted general intelligence. Such advanced AI would undoubtedly need large, complex networks, in which to learn and store many overlapping and different functions. Put this way, such advanced AI would seem just as vulnerable to thought disorders as us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This essay is not an answer, but a question. Because I want to know: will a network sufficiently complex to exhibit human-like intelligence also inevitably exhibit human-like disorders of thought?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are answers to the questions raised here. For example, if cell death and malfunction underlie every thought disorder, and those are always due to environmental stressors, then AI will be immune. In finding the answers to these questions, we will inevitably better understand the brain, and perhaps understand how to build a resilient, general purpose AI. A non-psychotic one. I think we’ve all seen enough sci-fi to agree: that would be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more on neuroscience at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Spike&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;@&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markdhumphries&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;markdhumphries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=84ca51e86557&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/ai-psychosis-84ca51e86557&quot;&gt;AI Psychosis&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike&quot;&gt;The Spike&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
