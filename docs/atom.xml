&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, in a time before Trump or Brexit or &lt;em&gt;This Is America,&lt;/em&gt; someone posted an overexposed photograph of a black and blue striped dress on Tumblr. Soon millions of people had seen it and started arguing about it. The reason? It quickly became apparent that about half of us – more often women and older people – perceive the dress, not as black and blue, but white and gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a neat example of real life echoing a classic psychology experiment (I’m referring to &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/p4403ed&quot;&gt;Asch&lt;/a&gt;), #thedress was enough to make you think your friends were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting&quot;&gt;gas lighting&lt;/a&gt; you – how could it be that you and they were looking at the exact same picture and yet seeing entirely different things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; data-shortcode=&quot;caption&quot; id=&quot;attachment_33879&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;440px-Grey_square_optical_illusion.svg&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-33879&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;33879&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;440px-Grey_square_optical_illusion.svg&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/440px-grey_square_optical_illusion-svg.png?w=440&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/440px-grey_square_optical_illusion-svg.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/440px-grey_square_optical_illusion-svg.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;440,340&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/16/three-years-of-research-into-thedress-digested-a-lesson-in-humility-for-perceptual-science/440px-grey_square_optical_illusion-svg/&quot; height=&quot;232&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/440px-grey_square_optical_illusion-svg.png?w=300&amp;amp;h=232&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;The squares marked A and B are actually the same shade of grey, via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checker_shadow_illusion&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there are many optical illusions, including others that involve colour (see, for example, the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checker_shadow_illusion&quot;&gt;checker shadow&lt;/a&gt;” illusion, pictured right). What was special about #thedress was that it triggered a bimodal split in perceptual experience among the population. Also, many illusions trigger a fluctuating percept, but once someone perceives the dress one way, they usually keep seeing it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral hits happen overnight. Science is slow, but it’s catching up. With the passing of the years, numerous studies into #thedress have now been published – 23 according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29422223&quot;&gt;new review&lt;/a&gt;. Here we present you with a fascinating digest of what’s been discovered so far about the famous frock – researchers have made progress, certainly, yet much remains mysterious, making this a humbling experience for perceptual science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33874&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A big part of it how you see the dress has to do with a process called colour constancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before any studies had been published, psychologists and vision experts were quick to explain that the #thedress illusion is related to a process called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_constancy&quot;&gt;colour constancy&lt;/a&gt;” whereby your brain takes environmental lighting effects (which are ambiguous in #thedress photo), and your own past experiences, into account when interpreting the precise wavelengths it believes are being reflected off a surface. The same automatic adjustment process allows us to recognise grass as green whatever the weather or time of day. The process sometimes goes wrong, though, like when the blue top you bought at the clothes store turns out to be black when you get home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How you see the dress depends partly on what inferences you make about the lighting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4921196/#SD2&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot 2018-05-14 13.39.47&quot; class=&quot; size-thumbnail wp-image-33880 alignleft&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;33880&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Screenshot 2018-05-14 13.39.47&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/screenshot-2018-05-14-13-39-47.png?w=382&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/screenshot-2018-05-14-13-39-47.png?w=128&amp;amp;h=150&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/screenshot-2018-05-14-13-39-47.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;382,448&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/16/three-years-of-research-into-thedress-digested-a-lesson-in-humility-for-perceptual-science/screenshot-2018-05-14-13-39-47/&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/screenshot-2018-05-14-13-39-47.png?w=128&amp;amp;h=150&quot; width=&quot;128&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If our inferences about the background lighting are relevant, as the initial expert reaction suggested, then manipulating the background illumination in an unambiguous way ought to have a direct effect on viewers’ perceptions of the dress. A team led by Rosa Lafer-Sousa found this to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4921196/#SD2&quot;&gt;the case&lt;/a&gt;. When they presented the dress against an obviously cool, blue-ish background (see image, left), most people saw it as white and gold, but when they presented it against a warm, yellowish background, most saw it as black and blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers Andrey Chetverikov and Ivan Ivanchei later developed this idea by showing that people’s perception of the dress are &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0301006616643664&quot;&gt;related to their assumptions about the light source in the original photograph&lt;/a&gt;. In their survey, people who saw the dress as black and blue were twice as likely as the white and gold group to believe that the dress is illuminated from the front, as if with a flash. Conversely, white and gold perceivers were more likely to believe there was a window behind the dress (implying under exposure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the survey, time of day seemed to make a modest difference to these assumptions, but still, the fundamental reasons why we come to make different inferences about the lighting remains largely unknown. In their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elsevier.es/en-revista-archivos-sociedad-espanola-oftalmologia-english-496-resumen-which-are-colors-dress-review-S2173579418300239&quot;&gt;new review&lt;/a&gt; of research into #thedress, published in &lt;em&gt;Archivos de la Sociedad Española de Oftalmología&lt;/em&gt;, ophthalmologist Julio González Martín-Moro and his colleagues state that the “dichotomic behaviour of this optical illusion is surprising and leads us to consider two different versions of the software in charge of maintaining chromatic [colour] constancy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your initial impression of the dress are likely to stick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This stubbornness of the percept could be because our brains continue to make the same assumptions about the scene, but alternatively it might be what Leila Drissi Daoudi and her colleagues describe as an example of “one shot learning”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2613309&quot;&gt;To test this, they manipulated naive participants’ perception of the dress by using occluders to block out the background&lt;/a&gt; – when they used black occluders (see above), this induced the perception of the dress as white and gold in nearly everyone; when they used white occluders, the opposite was true. Crucially, when the researchers took the occluders away, very few participants experienced any change in their perception of the dress’ colours. “There seems to be a one-shot learning mechanism in play, which leads to an imprinting of the color perceived”, the researchers wrote, although they were unable to explain what (without the use of occluders) induces the initial and lasting perception – they tested the location of people’s initial eye movements to the dress, but this made no difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The brains of gold/white perceivers are engaged in more interpretive processing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent with the idea that our inferences about the background lighting are important to #thedress illusion, the results from a brain imaging study that was published in 2015 suggested that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/27/first-brain-scan-study-to-feature-that-dress/&quot;&gt;people who see the dress as white and gold may be engaged in more “top down” interpretive processing, albeit that this processing leads to a misleading perception&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers scanned the brains of volunteers while they looked at the dress and found that those who perceived it as white and gold exhibited more neural activity in a raft of brain areas, including in frontal, parietal (near the crown of the head) and temporal (near the ears) regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this brain scan study couldn’t answer is whether the extra neural processing is the cause or consequence of the gold/white perceptual experience of the dress. However, a survey of patients with multiple sclerosis suggested the neural activity may be causal. Researchers in Italy found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msard-journal.com/article/S2211-0348(16)30022-0/pdf&quot;&gt;with greater progression of the disease, people were more likely to perceive the dress as blue and black&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps, the researchers speculated, this is because greater impairment of colour processing regions in the cortex led to “a less demanding black and blue vision of The Dress in more advanced MS”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Differences in the eye may also account for the illusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we perceive the dress might not all be about colour constancy and top-down brain processing. A 2016 study found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161090&quot;&gt;“front end” factors might also be relevant&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the researchers found that  “macular pigment optical density” was higher in volunteers who saw the dress as white and gold. Macular pigment is found in the retina and a greater density increases the amount of short wavelength light that is absorbed by the eye. “Our results indicate that early-stage optical, retinal and neural factors influence perception of the Dress”, the researchers said. Consistent with this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osapublishing.org/josaa/viewmedia.cfm?uri=josaa-33-3-A137&amp;amp;seq=0&amp;amp;html=true&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; found that white and gold perceivers tended to have smaller pupils potentially limiting the amount of light that falls on the retina, thus suggesting another early stage influence upon the perception of the dress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Past experience seems to be more important than genetics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, researchers in London and Cambridge published &lt;a href=&quot;http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2599740&quot;&gt;the first twin study&lt;/a&gt; into how people perceive the dress. By comparing the similarities in perception between identical and non-identical twins, they estimated that around 34 per cent of the variance in people’s perception is due to genetic differences, while 66 per cent is due to environmental factors (i.e. including learning and past experience). This was a small study, however, and the findings are tentative. Omar Mahroo and his colleagues concluded that the environmental factors “…may include prior lifetime experience to different spectral and luminance environments, shaping retinal and higher neuronal processing, and the development and evolution of [how come to name] object colors in various contexts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, there are lots of possibilities for how experience shapes our varied perceptions of colour in ambiguous scenes, all of which remain to be studied. We also no nothing about how common visual deficits, such as colour blindness and cataracts, interact with the perception of #thedress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lesson in humility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the senses, vision is the one that’s been studied most intensively by psychologists and neuroscientists. Despite this, there are no tests available that would allow even the best experts in the land to predict whether you will see the dress as black and blue or white and gold. And while we have some good ideas about the processes that are involved in #thedress illusion, so much remains mysterious about what leads each of us to view it one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of their review, González Martín-Moro and his colleagues come to a stark &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elsevier.es/en-revista-archivos-sociedad-espanola-oftalmologia-english-496-resumen-which-are-colors-dress-review-S2173579418300239&quot;&gt;conclusion:&lt;/a&gt; “…the fact is that researchers have failed to come up with a theory that can satisfactorily explain the dichotomic behaviour of the population when viewing said optical illusion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;

Channels are resources for scientists, making it easy to keep up to date with developments in a particular area of study and offering a way for exceptional research to be recognized and highlighted. All Channel content is curated by our expert Channel Editors, who are active leaders in their fields of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first Channel, launched a year ago, was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/vdrrc&quot;&gt;Veterans Disability &amp;amp; Rehabilitation Research Channel&lt;/a&gt;, soon followed by Channels for &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/tuberculosis&quot;&gt;Tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/cholera&quot;&gt;Cholera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/dfs&quot;&gt;Disease Forecasting &amp;amp; Surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/rtcc&quot;&gt;Responding to Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/open-source-toolkit&quot;&gt;Open Source Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;. To celebrate the first year of these Channels, we are awarding a prize of $500 to the authors of the best PLOS research featured in our first three Channels (Veterans Disability &amp;amp; Rehabilitation Research, Tuberculosis and Open Source Toolkit), with the winners chosen via a public vote. The polls will soon be available on&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/PLOSChannels&quot;&gt; Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll share more information about the competition on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/collections/&quot;&gt;PLOS Channels and Collections blog&lt;/a&gt; in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested in getting your paper featured in a Channel? Authors are encouraged to suggest their papers for inclusion in a relevant Channel – simply contact us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:channels@plos.org&quot;&gt;channels@plos.org&lt;/a&gt; (email) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PLOSChannels&quot;&gt;@PLOSChannels&lt;/a&gt; (Twitter) to let us know about your work, and Channel Editors will consider it for the next update. PLOS authors can also suggest a target Channel when submitting their manuscript, via the cover letter or the submission form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS believes that bringing communities together means research is shared more freely, and discoveries can be accelerated.

		<updated>2018-05-15T11:09:35+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/sun-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is generally understood that vitamin D plays a role in exerting health benefits related to bone strength and condition. However, the significance of that role is not well understood. A number of misconceptions about vitamin D may have contributed to the ambiguity and should be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, vitamin D is not really a vitamin. Vitamins are essential nutrients that the human body is incapable of producing. As such, vitamins must be obtained through diet. Vitamin D, on the other hand, is produced in mammalian skin upon exposure to UV rays from the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, vitamin D is not &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; responsible for exerting health benefits related to bone strength. Instead, vitamin D is converted to a pre-hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, in the liver. This pre-hormone circulates in the blood and is measured to determine the vitamin D status of an individual. However, it (like vitamin D) is inactive under normal biological conditions. Conversion of the pre-hormone to the active hormone (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) takes place in the kidney. The biological effects of the active hormone (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) have been demonstrated at a number of cell and tissue sites, and its activity is strongly linked to calcium maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, many consumers and healthcare providers are either unaware or simply fail to acknowledge that vitamin D status (when determined via measurements of serum levels of the pre-hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D) does not necessarily correlate to the same health outcomes in all individuals. This underappreciated detail about vitamin D status was explored in depth in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12919-018-0102-4?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Proceedings-Public_Health-Global&amp;amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_MAY2018_Vitamin_D_paradox_Black_Americans&quot;&gt;The vitamin D paradox in Black Americans: a systems-based approach to investigating clinical practice, research, and public health – expert panel meeting report. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does the relationship between vitamin D status and bone health differ in various segments of the population? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies show that low measures of vitamin D status correlate to increased risk of osteopenia and fractures in White and Mexican-Americans, but measures of vitamin D status do not correlate to the same health outcomes in Black Americans. Despite markedly low measures of vitamin D status in Black Americans, the incidence of falls, fractures, or osteopenia are significantly lower compared to White American counterparts with similar vitamin D status. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12919-018-0102-4&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; describes discussions amongst expert panelists that revealed that Black Americans gain no skeletal benefits from high doses of vitamin D supplementation; and high levels of the current marker for vitamin D status are almost certain to result in adverse effects in this population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should Black Americans worry about low measures of vitamin D status?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many factors that affect vitamin D status and skeletal health in Black Americans. Data presented in the &lt;em&gt;BMC Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; report shows that adiposity, skin pigmentation, genetics, and environment all contribute to differences in vitamin D status with respect to skeletal health in Black Americans vs. White Americans; but no one factor could fully explain the significance of low measures of vitamin D status with respect to skeletal health in Black Americans. A better understanding of these factors may be key to understanding mechanisms for improving bone health in all populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do we go from here?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers and healthcare providers should appreciate the potential for adverse effects following over-supplementation with high doses of vitamin D in some individuals. While threshold values (deficient lower levels vs. safe upper levels) for individuals require further refinement, outcomes presented in the &lt;em&gt;BMC Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; report suggest that the Recommended Daily Allowance values (400-600 IU/day) should be appropriate for most healthy populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health scientists should appreciate the need to better understand the role of vitamin D and its significance in various segments of the population that are commonly underrepresented in clinical studies. A larger forum or workshop on the topic may help to stimulate more research on vitamin D with respect to bone health as well as implications beyond bone health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social class may seem different today than in the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century. Former British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott’s comment in 1997 that “we are all middle class now” had a ring of truth, given that most people in the West have access to what once were luxuries, such as running water, in-house entertainment, and eye-catching brands. But this is something of an illusion, according to Cardiff University’s Antony Manstead, who shows &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjso.12251&quot;&gt;in the &lt;i&gt;British Journal of Social Psychology &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(open access)&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;how class is still written into our psychology, and the implications this has for how we behave and our wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33886&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Manstead presents evidence that shows socio-economic status (based on income and educational attainment – not identical with class, but an overlapping concept that’s used in much of the relevant research) remains as important to people’s identity as factors like gender or ethnicity. This is truer for wealthier people than lower earners suggesting some eroding of a positive working-class identity.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from obvious class markers like clothing, our behaviour is also still a giveaway: lab studies show that working-class people are more likely to employ eye-contact, laughter and head nods when interacting with others, compared to a more disengaged non-verbal style from the middle/upper classes. And class can be read at greater than chance levels even from stimuli as basic as Facebook photographs or seven words of speech. So we feel a certain class, and others can detect that class fairly easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the psychological consequences of this awareness of social class? Manstead describes how working class people are more likely to consider the world as a mass of forces and risks to contend with and accommodate, which manifests in various ways including their measurably higher levels of vigilance and a heightened threat detection system. This makes sense if you lack some of the resources (e.g. rich parents) that can buffer you from catastrophe, but may also reflect limiting beliefs. Meanwhile, middle/upper-class people are more motivated by internal states and personal goals. They are more solipsistic, on average: the issue is how they should shape the world, not how it pushes back on them. This is indicated by a higher sense of perceived control, and more confidence that good things happen to people due to their choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For working class people, this approach to the world has personal downstream consequences, including a higher degree of fatalism towards serious life outcomes, such as contracting HIV. These attitudes&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;may also contribute to greater illness susceptibility: one study found that people exposed to a cold or flu virus and held in quarantine were more likely to become ill if they considered themselves as a lower status social class, even while controlling for their actual class and levels of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the costs of the middle and upper-class approach seem to be externalised on the society at large. Put bluntly, the research that Manstead amasses suggests that those with of a higher socioeconomic class are less empathic, have more favourable attitudes towards greed, and are more likely to lie in negotiations. Merely thinking about yourself as higher up the status ladder leads to more selfishness. One can see how a solipsistic view could lead to these attitudes. In contrast, the contextual, real-world focus of lower-class people leads to empathy and a greater ability to see how external events may be shaping the emotions of other people. In addition, they have a greater degree of interdependent relationships and higher levels of social engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think social mobility might bridge this psychological gap between the classes, sliding more socially-minded people into positions of influence. Higher education is meant to be one of the engines of social mobility, but people from lower social classes are more likely to report feeling like a fish out of water at university, or to perceive the opportunities available to them as second-rate. Although it ought to be possible to address these anxieties about the unfamiliar, research suggests that the culture of universities may not be designed with the working classes in mind. University deans and administrators asked to list qualities of their culture tended to endorse words more about independence – the natural state of the solipsistic upper-class person, charting their course into the future – than interdependence, which tends to be a particular priority for first-generation university goers, looking to give back to their community. Manstead notes that these same cultural factors are also likely to be present in many workforces and professions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So “the system” has a psychological component that helps maintain the status quo. Yet there is an appetite for change: in surveys of nationally representative samples, including the wealthy, people repeatedly express a preference for a more equal society. There is even some evidence that greater equality can flip some of the negative trends described about the middle and upper class, leading them to be more, rather than less generous in some economic tasks (perhaps because they feel less entitlement and sense of threat in a more equal society). And the good news is that studies show that giving people an accurate picture of their socioeconomic standing, or telling them that inequality is rising, leads them to being more receptive to change.&lt;/p&gt;

 A researcher who has received millions in funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health and who runs a lab at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York has confessed to falsifying data in a 2014 paper. Gareth John, who studies multiple sclerosis and other neurological diseases, “has expressed remorse for … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2018/05/14/mount-sinai-multiple-sclerosis-researcher-admits-to-misconduct/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Mount Sinai multiple sclerosis researcher admits to misconduct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

The figure above shows the electrode implantation procedure for PD, where a stimulating electrode is placed in either the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subthalamic_nucleus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;subthalamic nucleus&lt;/a&gt;, (STN), a tiny collection of neurons within the basal ganglia circuit, or in the internal segment of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globus_pallidus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;globus pallidus&lt;/a&gt;, another structure in the basal ganglia (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMct1208070&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Okun, 2012&lt;/a&gt;). DBS of the STN is more common, and more often a source of disturbing non-motor side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In brief, DBS of the STN alters neural activity patterns in complex cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical networks (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19804831&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;McIntyre &amp;amp; Hahn, 2010&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DBS surgery may be recommended for some patients in whom dopamine (DA) replacement therapy has become ineffective, usually after a few years. DA medications include the classic DA precursor L-DOPA, followed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_agonist&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DA agonists&lt;/a&gt; such as pramipexole, ropinirole, and  bromocriptine. But unfortunately, impulse control disorders (ICDs, e.g., compulsive shopping, excessive gambling, binge eating, and compulsive sexual behavior) occur in about 17% of PD patients on DA agonists (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28229895&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Voon et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many first-person accounts from PD patients who describe uncharacteristic and embarrassing behavior after taking DA agonists, like this grandpa who started seeing prostitutes for the first time in his life:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/mar/31/familyandrelationships&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;'I have become an embarrassment'&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;For most of his life John Smithers was a respected family man who ran a  successful business. Then he started paying for sex. Now, in his 70s, he  explains how his behaviour has left him broke, alone and tormented &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 70 years old and used to be respectable. I was a magistrate for 25 years, and worked hard to feed my children and build up the family business. I was not the most faithful of husbands, but I tried to be discreet about my affairs.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Now I seem to be a liability. Over the last two decades I have spent a fortune on prostitutes and lost two wives. I have made irrational business decisions that took me to the point of bankruptcy. I have become an embarrassment to my nearest and dearest. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also reports like: &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/7223068.stm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Drug 'led patients to gamble'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New-onset ICDs can also occur in patients receiving STN DBS, but the effects are mixed across the entire population: ICD symptoms can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353802011000551&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;improve or remain unchanged&lt;/a&gt;. Why this is the case is a vexing problem that includes premorbid personality, genetics, family history, past and present addictions, and demographic factors (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28802938&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Weintraub &amp;amp; Claassen&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;- click on image for a larger view -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OkmzIFylqZM/WvFpHhfIeKI/AAAAAAAAMh8/ByUPixoGMRchJ1Xt_NIslf6-Cb643hvdgCLcBGAs/s1600/Correlates%2Bor%2Brisk%2Bfactors%2Bfor%2BICDs%2Bin%2BPD.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;862&quot; data-original-width=&quot;885&quot; height=&quot;388&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OkmzIFylqZM/WvFpHhfIeKI/AAAAAAAAMh8/ByUPixoGMRchJ1Xt_NIslf6-Cb643hvdgCLcBGAs/s400/Correlates%2Bor%2Brisk%2Bfactors%2Bfor%2BICDs%2Bin%2BPD.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neuroethicists are weighing in on the potential side effects of DBS that may alter a patient's perception of identity and &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12152-017-9334-7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Inducing Self-Estrangement&quot;&gt;self&lt;/a&gt;. A recent paper included a first-person account of altered personality and a sense of self-estrangement in a 46 year old woman undergoing STN DBS for PD (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29657181&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gilbert &amp;amp; Viaña, 2018&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The patient reported a persistent state of self-perceived changes  following implantation. More than one year after surgery, her narratives  explicitly refer to a persistent perception of strangeness and  alteration of her concept of self. For instance, she reported: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;disp-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;can't be the real me anymore—I can't  pretend . . . I think that I felt that the person that I have been  [since the intervention] was somehow observing somebody else, but it  wasn't me. . . . I feel like I am who I am now. But it's not the me that  went into the surgery that time. . . . My family say they grieve for  the old [me]. . . .&lt;/i&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of her quotes are striking in their similarity to behaviors that occur in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychcentral.com/disorders/manic-episode/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;manic phase&lt;/a&gt; of bipolar disorder {&lt;u&gt;loss of control, grandiosity&lt;/u&gt;}: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The patient also reported developing severe postoperative impulsivity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:  &quot;I cannot control the impulse to go off if I'm angry.&quot; In parallel,  while describing a sense of loss of control over some impulsions, she  has also recognized that &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;DBS gave her increased feelings of strength&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &quot;I  never had felt this lack of power or this giving of power—until I had  deep brain stimulation.&lt;/i&gt;&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{also &lt;u&gt;uncharacteristic sexual urges and hypersexuality; excessively energetic; compulsive shopping&lt;/u&gt;}:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;...she experienced radically enhanced capacities, in the form of increased&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; uncontrollable sexual urges&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;disp-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I know this is a bit embarrassing. But  I had 35 staples in my head, and we made love in the hospital bathroom  and that wasn't just me. It was just I had felt more sexual with the  surgery than without&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;continued&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;greater physical energy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;disp-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;I remember about a week after the  surgery, I still had the 35 staples in my head and I was just starting  to enter the cooler months of winter but my kids had got me winter  clothes so I had nothing to wear to the follow up appointment and when I  went back there of the morning, &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;I thought &quot;I can walk into the  doctor's&quot; even though it was 5 kilometers into town.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It's like the  psychologist said: &quot;For a woman who had a very invasive brain surgery 9  days ago and you've just almost walked 10 kilometers.&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;And on the way, I  stopped and bought a very uncharacteristic dress, backless—completely  different to what I usually do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Examining the DSM-5 criteria for bipolar mania, it seems clear (to me, at least) that the patient is indeed having a prolonged manic episode induced by STN DBS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;In order for a &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://psychcentral.com/disorders/manic-episode/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;manic episode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to be diagnosed, three (3) or more of the following symptoms must be present:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decreased need for sleep (e.g., one feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flight of ideas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or subjective experience that thoughts are racing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Attention is easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant items&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;, at work or school;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt; or sexually) or psychomotor agitation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Excessive  involvement in pleasurable activities that have a high potential for  painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees,  sexual indiscretions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, or foolish business investments)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's also notable that she divorced her husband, moved to another state, ruptured the therapeutic relationship with her neurologist and surgical team, and made a suicide attempt. She also took up painting and perceived the world in a more vibrant, colorful way {which resembles narratives of persons experiencing manic episodes}:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;I don't know, all the senses came alive. I wanted to listen to Paul  Kelly and all of my favorite music really loud in the toilet. And you  know, also everything was colourful. . . . Well, since brain surgery I  can. I didn't bother before. I can see the light . . . the light that is  underlying every masterpiece in  photography. . . . I've seen it like I've never seen it before . . . &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;I  am a totally different person. I like it that I love photography and  music and colourful clothes, but where is the old me now?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, she appears to display more insight into her altered behavior than {most} people in the midst of bipolar mania. Perhaps her reality monitoring abilities are more intact? Or it's because her symptoms wax and wane.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But like in many manic individuals, she did not want this feeling to stop:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I went to the psychiatrist, and he said, &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Right, well, this is bordering  on mania&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;[NOTE: that is an understatement]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;span&gt; you need to turn the settings right down to manage it.' &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;I  said to him, 'Please don't, this is not over the top—this is just joy.' &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this line of research &lt;span class=&quot;Y0NH2b CLPzrc&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; studying individuals with Parkinson's who have impulse control disorders due to DA replacement or DBS &lt;span class=&quot;Y0NH2b CLPzrc&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;  can provide insight into bipolar mania. Certainly, drugs that act as antagonists at multiple DA receptor subtypes (typical and atypical antipsychotics) are used in the management of bipolar disorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patient narratives are also informative in this regard, and provide critical information for individuals considering various types of therapies for PD. In this paper, the patient was not informed by the medical team that there could be undesirable psychiatric side effects. She has taken legal action against the lead neurosurgeon, and the proceedings were ongoing when the article was written.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ADDENDUM (May 14 2018): &lt;/b&gt;The study was conducted in accordance with Human Research  Ethics Committee regulations. The patient provided consent to have her narratives included in  publications on neuropsychiatric side effects of DBS for PD.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;One might wonder whether Mr. Smithers' premorbid propensity for affairs made him more vulnerable for compulsive sexual activity after DA agonists. And that is one consideration displayed in the box and circle diagram above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She did experience bouts of depression as well as mania, perhaps related to the stimulation parameters and precise location. And bipolar individuals also gain insight once the manic episode subsides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gilbert F, Viaña JN.

 A few years ago, Richard Miller of the University of Michigan had a serious dilemma: He discovered a former researcher in his lab was doing research somewhere else. Normally, that would be fine — except this research had admitted to committing misconduct in Miller’s lab. Should he tell the researcher’s new employer? This turns out … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2018/05/14/a-former-employee-admitted-to-scientific-misconduct-his-new-institution-likely-doesnt-know-what-should-you-do/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;A former employee admitted to scientific misconduct.

&lt;p&gt;Studies of identical and non-identical twins indicate that our self-esteem is influenced by the genes we inherited from our parents, but also, and perhaps slightly more so, by environmental factors. And according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-06114-001&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, these environmental influences started playing a lasting role very early in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ulrich Orth at the University of Bern has reported evidence that, on average, the higher the quality of a person’s home environment when they were aged between 0 and 6 years – based on warm and responsive parenting; cognitive stimulation; and a safe, organised physical environment – the higher their self-esteem many years later in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33860&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data come from nearly 9,000 individuals, born between 1970 and 2001, whose mothers had enrolled in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth that started in the US in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orth analysed the biennial interviews with the mothers that took place in their homes when their children – the participants in this study – were aged 0 to 6. This provided the measure of the quality of the participants’ early childhood home environment in terms of parental warmth and responsiveness, cognitive stimulation and the safety and organisation of the home. Orth also noted the quality of the relationship between mother and father during this period; the presence or not of the father; maternal depression; and family poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures of the participants’ self-esteem started when they were aged just 8 and continued biennially until they were 27. The survey researchers used a measure designed for children until the participants were age 14, and thereafter switched to the well-known Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical finding is that the quality of the home environment between the ages of 0 to 6 correlated significantly with participants’ self-reported self-esteem in later childhood, and even with their self-esteem into adulthood, although the association weakened over time. “The findings suggest that the home environment is a key factor in early childhood that influences the long-term development of self-esteem”, Orth said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other childhood environmental factors besides the quality of the home environment were also associated with later self-esteem. Maternal depression (associated with lower self-esteem) and better quality of parents’ relationship (associated with higher self-esteem) correlated with participants’ self-esteem in later childhood, but these correlations approached zero over the longer-term into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the families’ poverty (associated with lower self-esteem) and, to a lesser extent, the presence of the father (associated with higher self-esteem) continued to correlate with later self-esteem through to age 27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When factoring out quality of the home environment, the association between these other childhood factors (maternal depression, parents’ relationship, poverty, and father’s presence) and participants’ later self-esteem was weakened substantially (but not entirely eradicated) suggesting that these other factors are tied to later self-esteem largely via their influence on the quality of the home environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orth added a note of caution in relation to the findings for fathers’ presence. The data do not say anything about homosexual same-sex parents and children’s later self-esteem because such a family situation was too rare in the survey. It’s possible, he says, that the presence of any second parent – not necessarily a father – would have the same associations with later, higher self-esteem. In any case, the association between father’s presence and later self-esteem, though statistically significant, was only very small (over the long term, the effect sizes for poverty and especially for quality of the home environment were larger).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should the early family environment have such enduring associations with later self-esteem? Orth believes it is because early child-parent interactions affect a person’s pre-conscious representations of who they are and their self worth, eventually becoming deeply embodied in their self concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orth says his findings have important practical implications because they suggest that interventions designed to enhance the quality of the early home environment could have lasting benefits for a child’s self-esteem. The way that the quality of the home environment mediated the role of other factors, like poverty, is particularly relevant. This suggests, Orth explains, that “…the negative effects of poverty on children’s self-esteem could be prevented, or at least reduced, by interventions that improve the quality of the home environment in families that are in poverty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all survey research of this kind, it’s important to remember that causality has not been demonstrated conclusively between the earlier measured factors and later self-esteem – it’s possible unknown factors are at play. Most obviously, a study of this kind cannot account for the role played by genes shared between parents and their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a deeper question is whether higher self-esteem is a desirable outcome at all. There was a time when many psychologists and social reformers believed increasing the average self-esteem of a community would open the doors to a range of welcome outcomes, from superior mental health to career success. However, we know today that the benefits of greater self-esteem are &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1529-1006.01431?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed&quot;&gt;quite modest&lt;/a&gt;, mostly centred on feeling happier and having more initiative, and that excessive self-esteem can even be problematic in some cases, especially if it slides into narcissism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-06114-001&quot;&gt;The family environment in early childhood has a long-term effect on self-esteem: A longitudinal study from birth to age 27 years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Corey Moran&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mens et Manus” a phrase coined years ago, was adopted by one of the nation’s most prestigious and distinguished Universities, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Very simply it translates as “Mind and Hand”. Yet this seemingly simple statement harbors a rather impactful notion, one that was a drastic departure from the status quo of the time. Education at its core should not be for the sole sake of scholarly enlightenment but rather have tangible implications; enabling discoveries and advancements in practical knowledge that directly impact society in a positive way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A curious, talented high school student embodies the very essence of these ideals. In just a few short months she will be joining MIT’s ranks, quickly becoming an example of what it means to practice “Mind and Hand”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most, reminiscing about high school evokes flashbacks of typical milestones and events that were important to the teenage versions of ourselves. The feeling of elation after obtaining a driver’s license and the smidgen of freedom that comes with it. Laughing with friends at Friday night football games. Prom in all of its glory and teenage awkwardness. The stress and anxiety accompanying college applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Claudia Cabral, a senior at Suncoast Community High School and scientist in the making, the snapshot of her high school journey includes some rather extraordinary experiences and accomplishments.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those that are fortunate enough to know Claudia describe her as bright, driven, personable, a savvy coder and most importantly cognizant and caring of the world around her. While Claudia’s exceptional grades and demanding course load alone are clear indications of her intelligence and determination, it’s what she does in her free time that truly showcases her passions and commitment to making a difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to a busy academic schedule, Claudia is president of not one but two charitable organizations focusing on local and extended community outreach. The first named “Hugs and Kisses Club” raises money to assist local cancer patients and the second, which she is also the founder, named “Two Feet Club” tackles a diverse set of social issues in creative ways. Through the combined efforts of these two organizations, Claudia has raised money and promoted awareness for issues like foster care, Syrian refugees, victims of domestic violence and people with mental disabilities to name a few. Even at her young age, the drive to make a positive impact in her community is evident, a sentiment she describes as “just a part of who I am.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past November Claudia was recognized as a “Future Lady of Grace” by the Bethesda Hospital Foundation for her outstanding work in philanthropy. Due to her remarkable accomplishments and merit, Claudia was selected as 1 of only 6 interns to participate in the 2017 High School Summer Research Program at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each summer MPFI offers aspiring, young scientists an immersive laboratory experience where local students have the opportunity to work side-by-side with world class neuroscientists. As a part of the six-week internship, students along with their mentors, design and execute a high-level research project that culminates into a presentation of their work at the end of the summer. Interns gain a first-hand insight into brain structure and function, scientific collaboration and the cutting-edge techniques and advanced imaging technologies that MPFI scientists use every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This immersive program at MPFI wouldn’t be possible without the generous support and funding from the J.M Rubin Foundation, the Celia Lipton Farris and Victor W. Farris Foundation, and the Gertrude E. Skelly Charitable Foundation which support students in their exploration of science and help to cultivate the next generation of future scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After participating in the MPFI internship, students continue their education at some of the most elite universities, further developing their skills in outstanding STEM programs across the nation.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. David Fitzpatrick, CEO and Scientific Director of MPFI thoughtfully remarked that “I don’t believe that the brief few months working in the labs at MPFI are the main reason our interns were accepted to such prestigious universities, the students were already exceptional to begin with. We just know how to pick them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poised and articulate, Claudia delivered an engaging final presentation on her work in the Schummers’ lab studying the phenomenon called visual contrast adaptation. This process describes the brain’s ability to acclimate to new surroundings and respond quickly to any changes in it. Although studied previously, the exact mechanisms that drive this process are unknown. Through her work, Claudia both engineered a computational algorithm that could precisely model the events as well as proposed astrocytes as being the cell type responsible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that moment, detailing the intricacies of relevant scientific theories, obstacles encountered and innovative solutions developed, it would be hard to think of Claudia simply as a high school student and not a seasoned graduate level researcher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common thread linking Claudia’s collegiate future, her internship and the ideals she advocates every day, is another visionary. Alexander W. Dreyfoos a graduate of MIT, board member of MPFI and unwavering supporter of the arts and sciences, champions the very same principles that Claudia does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The core values of MPFI align very closely to my own and the ideals of MIT that resonated with me while studying there. I have kept them with me ever since.” -Alexander W. Dreyfoos, Chairman of the Dreyfoos Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward with her education at MIT and beyond, Claudia sees herself as a biomedical engineer and neuroscientist, innovating technology to help treat people with movement disorders like Parkinson’s, ALS and essential tremor. Staying true to her philanthropic side she hopes to continue public outreach, engaging in speaking and fundraising events, giving back to her local communities and abroad. There is no one better suited than Claudia to take up the mantle of the simple but profound motto “Mens et Manus”.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 A new paper in ACS Chemical Neuroscience pulls no punches in claiming that most of what we know about the neuroscience of learning is wrong: Dendritic Learning as a Paradigm Shift in Brain Learning



According to authors Shira Sardi and colleagues, the prevailing view which is that learning takes place in the synapses is mistaken. Instead, they say, 'dendritic learning' is how brain cells really store information.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Innovation is the spice of life; it brings out the complex flavors of our ideas and elevates them to new heights. Scientific research becomes stagnant without it, as does just about every other profession. To put it plainly, innovative breakthroughs have the potential to challenge the way we think and live. Within the past few years, we have witnessed significant paradigm shifts within life science research thanks to breakthroughs from several sources such as Silicon Valley tech startups, biotech companies, CROs, academic labs, and government institutes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To illustrate, some providers in our network now offer virtual reality services for highly-advanced 3D molecular visualization, while others provide blockchain technology to help you protect your IP (intellectual property)  and facilitate secure data storage and transfer. These providers and many more can be found on Science Exchange — offering services ranging from artificial intelligence platforms that help scientists make better drug efficacy predictions early in the research cycle, to highly inventive 3D organoid models that recapitulate human pathology in vitro. As such, we have witnessed many technologies of the future become the reality of today. Science Exchange has been and will always be ready to give you access to innovative technologies before they become mainstream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Having to wait a lot in railway stations, I will present two recent articles from Scientific American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one (November 2017, written by Christof Koch) discusses a study by Casarotto et al. (Annals of Neurology 80, 718-729) where a metric of algorithmic complexity of an evoked EEG response is used to measure consciousness in coma patients and controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second one (April 2018) discusses old work by Ichiji Tasaki (1960-1990s) and recent work by Thomas Heimburg claiming that action potential propagation is not an electrical but a mechanical phenomenon (a shock wave with piezo-electric side-effects).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/Fotolia_104767152_Subscription_Yearly_XXL-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia conjures up many images in one’s mind. Popular culture has depicted characters with the disease in films such as ‘Fight Club’ and ‘A Beautiful Mind’. But what is the disease really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are records since at least the emergence of the written alphabet, that describe signs and symptoms which today would be called schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, schizophrenia is extremely complex and manifests itself in myriad ways. It is a psychiatric disorder that primarily affects one of the most, if not the most, important organs in our body: the brain. In the clinic, a presentation of the so-called positive symptoms: hallucinations and delusions  along with negative symptoms: apathy and depression for a period lasting anywhere from one to six months tends to be classified under the category of Schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are records since at least the emergence of the written alphabet, that describe signs and symptoms which today would be called schizophrenia. Furthermore, these records exist in cultures that have been separated by geography and time. This is one of the defining features of the disease – a global lifetime prevalence of 1% that does not depend on where or when one is born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A stable global prevalence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manifestation of this disease across cultures and millenia makes one wonder why natural selection, seems to neither eliminate nor reduce the prevalance of the disease. The disease usually manifests  in late adolescence to early 20’s, the prime period of reproduction. Yet despite the observation of reduced fecundity amongst patients, the disease persists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many hypotheses have been suggested to explain the persistence of the disease, the most prominent is Timothy J. Crow’s ‘evolutionary hypothesis’, put forward more than twenty years ago.  This hypothesis stipulates that the disease is a by-product of the evolution of the human mind – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920996497001102&quot;&gt;that language and psychosis are connected&lt;/a&gt;. This was initially very difficult to test as there was no way to determine when language nor psychosis manifested first in the human lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the sequencing of the entire human genome opened many frontiers, including the possibility of tracing evolutionary events that shaped humans. &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6183/523&quot;&gt;Recent work&lt;/a&gt; has traced the evolution of DNA methylation on the human genome since the divergence from the common ancestors of Neanderthals and Denisovans. Such regions of the human genome, with variable methylation between humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans are termed as differentially methylated regions or DMRs for short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-10170&quot; height=&quot;466&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/figure-1-1024x746.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examining DMRs for Schizophrenia associated SNPs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our work, published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Evolutionary Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we build upon the results of these DMRs. We systematically investigated whether these regions are enriched for individual nucleotides on the human genome, otherwise known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These SNPs have been  associated with Schizophrenia and twelve other traits through previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Our findings indicate that the human DMRs but not Neanderthal or Denisovan DMRs harbour more SNPs associated with Schizophrenia than can be expected by chance alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important caveat to keep in mind is the fact that GWAS studies only help to determine regions of the human genome (SNPs) &lt;em&gt;associated&lt;/em&gt; with a trait/disease and seldom to variants that are &lt;em&gt;causative&lt;/em&gt;. More often than not, the results from GWAS instead point to markers involved in various developmental pathways or regions that regulate the complex orchestra of protein formation in the human body. Thus even when we say schizophrenia associated SNPs, the SNPs in and of themselves are merely associated and not causative of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of enrichment of Neanderthal or Denisovan DMRs for SNPs associated with Schizophrenia could be interpreted in at least two different ways. The first and obvious interpretation is that the regions delineating methylation differences in our evolutionarily extinct cousins did not harbour more genetic variants associated with schizophrenia than expected by chance. This might make us tempted to believe that they may have been devoid of symptoms classified as schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that regions of the human genome whose methylation has changed specifically in the human lineage, over evolutionary time, are enriched for schizophrenia associated SNPs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, such an interpretation is potentially misleading due to limitations in the methodology and materials for analyses. The genetic variants we analysed have been mapped to the human genome. However we do not know if the Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes possess any genetic variants associated with schizophrenia. A crude way to solve this issue would be to try an alignment of the genome sequences of humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans and determine sequence similarity in the regions associated with schizophrenia, but this is easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second interpretation would be that the methylation changes that occurred in the human lineage since the divergence from Neanderthals and Denisovans, at least in-part have co-occurred in genomic regions harbouring schizophrenia risk variants. This interpretation has the support of other genetic studies that looked at  only the underlying human genome sequence, i.e the DNA, that have been under &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/32/5/1148/1134520&quot;&gt;selective pressure&lt;/a&gt; for enrichment of Schizophrenia associated SNPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results on these DMRs , together with other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(15)00855-0/abstract&quot;&gt;genetic studies&lt;/a&gt; are now beginning to lend support to the evolutionary hypothesis of schizophrenia formulated by TJ Crow. We show that regions of the human genome whose methylation has changed specifically in the human lineage, over evolutionary time, are enriched for schizophrenia associated SNPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since methylation is oftentimes influenced by the environment, our results may also suggest the environments experienced by our ancestors might have contributed to the variable methylation in genomic regions associated with schizophrenia. We are still a long way off from proving language and psychosis are linked. However, we and &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169227&quot;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; have now shown that at a group-level, recent evolution may in part have made us vulnerable to schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that stress increases the risk of breast cancer is a persistent one, despite a number of major large-scale findings to the contrary. “Over the past 40 years, women have been exposed to strong messages about the importance of ‘thinking positively’ and reducing stress in their lives, which can add to the burden of guilt in those who develop cancer, who feel they have somehow failed”, note the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pon.4740&quot;&gt;new prospective study&lt;/a&gt; of women in Australia, published in &lt;i&gt;Psycho-Oncology&lt;/i&gt;. Their findings suggest that neither acute nor chronic stressors recorded over a three-year period influenced the likelihood that a woman with a strong family history of breast cancer would develop the disease over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results, based on rigorous methodology, add to the growing literature providing reassurance to women at increased risk of breast cancer, who are concerned that the (often unavoidable) stressors in their lives may increase their risk of breast cancer”, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33851&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team led by Phyllis Butow at the University of Sydney recruited 2,739 women from 990 families via a centre for research into familial breast cancer. Some of these women had genes that are known to increase the likelihood of developing breast cancer whereas the others did not, although there was an unusually high number of breast cancer cases in their family. At the start of the study, none of the women had ever been diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On enrolment, the women were interviewed by a researcher over the phone, to collect details of any acute and chronic stressors they’d experienced over the past three years. Independent raters later rated these stressors as either acute or chronic; mild, moderate or severe; and noted their duration (for example, the death of a spouse was considered a severe acute stressor; moving home was a moderate acute stressor; caring for a handicapped child was a severe chronic stressor; a neighbourly dispute was rated as a moderate chronic stressor).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women also completed questionnaires that measured their levels of social support, optimism, anger control, “anti-emotionality” (emotional stunting), and also anxiety and depression (the researchers measured and adjusted for anxiety and depression because of their potential influence on the self-reports of stressors and the psychosocial variables).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interviews and questionnaires were repeated at three-yearly intervals for another 12 years, though only a few women completed all of the follow-ups. During the study period, 103 of the women were diagnosed with breast cancer. The researchers analysed the data to see if moderate/severe acute or chronic stress, or the psycho-social variables (adjusting for anxiety and depression), were associated with a subsequent increased risk of being diagnosed with cancer, but in fact none of them were (there was a trend for chronic severe stress to increase risk of diagnosis, but this was statistically non-significant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers argue that the study overcame methodological limitations of some other studies, in that, for example, there were objective ratings of various different kinds of stressor, and these stressors were assessed before diagnosis, rather than being reported by women after diagnosis.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in theory possible that stress did have an influence on breast cancer risk, but it was so small, compared with the genetic influences on the particular women in this study, that it couldn’t be detected. Also, while the results may not generalise to women in the general population, the researchers note that “internationally, most rigorous studies have also failed to find an association between psychosocial factors and cancer” (for example, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/20/new-meta-analysis-undermines-the-myth-that-negative-emotions-can-cause-cancer/&quot;&gt;the meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; we covered last year). However, there are some conflicting findings, including those from &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/157/5/415/76660&quot;&gt;a study of Finnish twins&lt;/a&gt; published in 2003 that found severe negative life events, like divorce, were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the researchers concluded: “Given the lack of evidence for an association between stressors and psychosocial factors and [breast cancer], we suggest that women at increased risk of [breast cancer] focus on proven methods of risk reduction such as close monitoring, risk-reduction medication, or, for those at high risk, surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pon.4740&quot;&gt;Does stress increase risk of breast cancer? A 15‐year prospective study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sports coaches are always on the look out for new ideas to improve their players’ performance and it’s understandable that insights from psychology and neuroscience hold particular appeal. However, as with other applied fields, it’s not easy to translate neuroscience findings into useful sports interventions. There are also a lot of charlatans who use the mystique of the brain to sell quack sports products and programmes. Without specialist neuroscience training, coaches might struggle to distinguish genuine brain insights from neuro-based flimflam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s in this context that a group of researchers, led by Richard Bailey at the International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education in Berlin, thought it would be useful to see which scientifically challenged practices sports coaches use, and whether they are able to identify brain facts from myths. Previous work has identified widespread belief in neuromyths among several other groups, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/05/belief-in-brain-myths-and-child-development-myths-continues-even-among-those-whove-studied-psychology/&quot;&gt;psychology students&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/19/music-teachers-and-students-fall-for-music-related-neuromyths-german-study/&quot;&gt;music teachers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/07/20/oh-dear-even-people-with-neuroscience-training-believe-an-awful-lot-of-brain-myths/&quot;&gt;neuroscience graduates&lt;/a&gt;, but this is the first time sports coaches have been tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporting their results in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00641/full&quot;&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Bailey and his colleagues found that sports coaches endorsed, on average, just over 40 per cent of the six brain myths presented to them. “The figure is substantial enough to warrant concern,” according to Bailey and his colleagues “because it is likely that these beliefs will shape coaching philosophy and practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33846&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are based on a survey of nearly 550 coaches in the UK and Ireland who took part by responding to adverts on social media. They coached a range of sports including football, rugby, swimming and cricket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coaches reported using the scientifically unsupported concept of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/03/another-nail-in-the-coffin-for-learning-styles-students-did-not-benefit-from-studying-according-to-their-supposed-learning-style/&quot;&gt;learning styles&lt;/a&gt;” frequently and this also happened to be the neuromyth that they endorsed most strongly (over 62 per cent of the coaches said they agreed with the concept). Around half also endorsed the idea that short bursts of coordination exercises can improve the integration of left and right-hemishphere brain function, which chimes with the fact they said they made frequent use of the pseudoscientific Brain Gym programme that espouses this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, the coaches reported only infrequent use of the empirically challenged approaches of NLP, the Myers-Briggs Type Inventory and Action Types Approach, while they made frequent use of the more scientifically legitimate techniques/approaches of direct instruction, guided discovery, demonstrations and growth mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning to the other myths on the list, 43 percent and 55 per cent of the coaches said they believed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-myths/201206/why-the-left-brain-right-brain-myth-will-probably-never-die&quot;&gt;left-brain, right-brain myth&lt;/a&gt; and the myth that children are less attentive after consuming sugar, respectively. In contrast, their endorsement was much lower for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-10-brain-myth-explained-in-60-seconds/&quot;&gt;10 per cent brain myth&lt;/a&gt; and the myth that there are critical periods in childhood after which things can no longer be learned (22.6 and 16.6 per cent of them endorsed these myths, respectively, on average).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also presented the coaches with six “general assertions” about the brain that are scientifically supported, including that vigorous exercise can improve mental function. On average, the coaches agreed with 56.6 per cent of these more evidence-based statements, although fewer than 10 per cent realised that boys have bigger brains than girls and fewer than 20 per cent realised that the two brain hemispheres always work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research on misbeliefs about the brain has found that a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing – for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fBPyBQAAQBAJ&amp;amp;q=teachers#v=snippet&amp;amp;q=teachers&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;belief in brain myths was previously found to be higher among teachers with more general knowledge about the brain&lt;/a&gt;. This pattern was replicated here among sports coaches – those with superior brain knowledge, and those who thought neuroscience was more likely to be helpful for their work, also tended to believe more in the neuromyths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailey and his colleagues end with a number of recommendations to combat neuro-bunk in sports coaching, including increasing contact between coaches and scientists and establishing an independent advisory body for sports governing bodies, akin to the UK’s National Institute for Health Care Excellence that provides evidence-based guidelines to health professionals. More generally, “coach education should be strengthened by encouraging the cultivation of a healthy scepticism,” they concluded. “As the first of its kind with sports coaches, this study can be understood as a contribution to these endeavours”, they concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that taking a gap year allows you to “find yourself” is often derided. But if you spend that time living in one foreign country, it just might. And if you can make it year&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;, even better.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hajo Adam at Rice University, US, led what his team say is the first empirical investigation of the effects of living abroad on “self-concept clarity” – how clearly and confidently someone defines who they “are”. Since people are increasingly spending time living abroad for work or study – and since other “transitional” life experiences, such as getting a new job or getting divorced have been associated with &lt;i&gt;decreases&lt;/i&gt; in self-concept clarity – it’s important to study this, the researchers write in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597817301279&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33848&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited a total of 1,874 people to take part in a series of studies. The first involved 296 people, recruited online. Half had lived abroad at some point. They all completed a 12-item self-concept clarity scale, indicating the extent to which they did or didn’t agree with statements like: “In general, I have a clear sense of who I am and what I am” and “I seldom experience conflict between the different aspects of my personality”. Those who had lived abroad had a clearer self-concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But might this be because this type of person is more likely to pursue opportunities abroad? To find out, the team recruited 261 more people, 136 of whom had lived abroad. The others hadn’t yet, but had definite plans to, with most intending to move within around nine months. As well as the self-concept clarity scale, participants completed an assessment of their “self-discerning reflections” – such as: “I have figured out if my relationships with others are driven by my own values or follow the values of those around me” and “I have determined whether my personality is defined by who I truly am or by the culture I grew up in”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those participants who’d already lived abroad had clearer self-concepts than the others who shared the same plans to live abroad but hadn’t travelled yet, and this was explained statistically by their higher scores for self-discerning reflections (this was after controlling for a range of demographic and personality variables). These results suggest that time abroad increases self-discerning reflection and in turn this leads to greater self concept clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other studies the researchers conducted, including in some cases with students from dozens of different countries, led them to conclude that it’s total time spent living abroad – rather than the number of different countries lived in – that makes for greater self-concept clarity (among these participants the average time spent living abroad was 3.3 years). Greater clarity can also have a practical advantage: international students who’d spent more time living abroad reported feeling clearer about their future career direction, an outcome that was mediated by increased self-concept clarity. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fact that we found consistent support for our hypotheses across different subject populations…mixed methods…and complementary methods of self-concept clarity…highlights the robustness of living abroad on self-concept clarity”, the researchers write. “The present research is the first to show that living abroad can change structural aspects of the self-concept.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other research has found that living abroad can influence the content of a person’s self-concept – with words such as “adventurous” being added to their self-descriptions. But the new findings suggest that, because living abroad, away from your usual cultural environment, allows you to confront and perhaps redefine what truly is and isn’t important to you, it also leads to improved confidence in and clarity about who you are.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;And the longer you live abroad, the more self-discerning reflections you’re likely to have, the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper concludes with a quote from a 1919 book called &lt;i&gt;Travel Diaries of a Philosopher&lt;/i&gt; by German philosopher Hermann von Keyserling: “The shortest path to oneself leads around the world.” The researchers add: “Almost 100 years later, our research provides empirical evidence in support of this idea.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emma Young&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EmmaELYoung&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;@EmmaELYoung&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;) is Staff Writer at &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;BPS Research Digest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is nationality? Is it something fixed that we inherit biologically from our parents or is it a characteristic that we can change and acquire? A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0334-3&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt; is the first to study people’s “folk theories” about nationality – based on surveys of US and Indian participants – and the results show that, at least in these countries, people are broadly sympathetic toward both these contrasting theories of nationality at the same time, although with a bias toward the fluid theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relative strength of people’s endorsement of the theories at any given time depended on the way questions about nationality were framed, the researchers found. Moreover, and perhaps most interesting for future investigation, the results showed people’s ideas about nationality were tied to their attitudes toward immigration, even after factoring out any differences in political leanings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33830&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostafa Rad and Jeremy Ginges at the New School for Social Research and Princeton University surveyed a total of 2013 US participants and 732 Indian participants. They presented the participants with variations of the following scenario:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please imagine the following: A child is born to Pakistani parents but is orphaned at birth. When the child is one day old, they are adopted and raised by an American family and are never told about their origin.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the participants were asked, “all things considered”, to rate how much, from 0 to 100 per cent, the child will match the nationality of his or her birth parents, or – in a different framing – they were asked to make the same assessment for how much the child will match the nationality of their adoptive parents (debriefing clarified that, as hoped, the participants were considering nationality, not citizenship – which depends on more obvious and explicit legal stipulations that vary in different countries).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants’ views on what governs nationality varied according to the framing of the question – on the one hand, they stated on average that the child would share 77.8 per cent (US participants) or 74.2 per cent (Indian participants) of their adoptive parents’ nationality, suggesting a fluid view of nationality. Yet, when the question was framed around the birth parents’ nationality, the participants also stated that the child would share 39 percent (US participants) or 45.4 per cent (Indian participants) of their birth parents’ nationality, on average, indicative of a more fixed, genetic-based folk theory of nationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varying the scenario wording so that the birth and adoptive parents’ skin colour was the same or different (based on ethnic and national stereotypes) made little difference to participants’ rates of agreement with both the fluid and genetic folk theories of nationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that, at least in the US and India, a lot of people hold in their heads two contradictory theories about the roots of nationality at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cultural evolution may have favored such flexible reasoning about the acquisition of nationality,” the researchers said, “as the ‘malleable’ theory allows for a rapid expansion of the group, whereas the ‘fixed’ theory suggests an inborn and immutable essence that gives a sense that nationality is more than a mere social contract but an ineffable primordial attachment encouraging deep moral commitments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rad and Ginges were able to explore some of these dynamics by tweaking the wording of the question that they put to participants. For instance, they tried out versions in which the child’s birth parents happened to share the participant’s own nationality (while the child’s adopted parents had another nationality), and versions in which this was reversed, so that it was the child’s adopted parents who shared the participant’s own nationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results for these different permutations of the vignette showed that participants generally saw their own nationality as harder to relinquish but easier to acquire, as compared with a foreign nationality (which they saw as easier to lose, but harder to gain). In the era of Brexit and Trump’s “great, great wall” these results may surprise some: “… [F]olk theories of nationality are biased towards immigration and against emigration, perhaps facilitating ingroup expansion,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, as you might have predicted, the results showed that, in terms of differences between individuals in the strength of their belief in the different folk theories, those people who more strongly endorsed a fixed or genetic-based theory of nationality tended to have more hostile attitudes toward immigration, even after factoring out any differences in political leanings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Future work could build on our results to model social and political factors that may influence the distributive strength of malleable versus fixed conceptions of nationality,” the researchers concluded, “helping us to predict variations in attitudes towards migration across time and context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0334-3&quot;&gt;Folk theories of nationality and anti-immigrant attitudes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxx-is-the-brain-a-computer/"/>
		<id>http://romainbrette.fr/?p=1502</id>
		<updated>2018-05-07T09:46:29+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="fr-FR">
 &lt;p&gt;It is sometimes stated as an obvious fact that the brain carries out computations. Computational neuroscientists sometimes see themselves as looking for the algorithms of the brain. Is it true that the brain implements algorithms? My point here is not to answer this question, but rather to show that the answer is not self-evident, and that it can only be true (if at all) at a fairly abstract level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One line of argumentation is that models of the brain that we find in computational neuroscience (neural network models) are algorithmic in nature, since we simulate them on computers. And wouldn’t it be a sort of vitalistic claim that neural networks cannot be (in principle) simulated on computer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an important confusion in this argument. At a low level, neural networks are modelled biophysically as dynamical systems, in which the temporality corresponds to the actual temporality of the real world (as opposed to the discrete temporality of algorithms). Mathematically, those are typically differential equations, possibly hybrid systems (i.e. coupled by timed pulses), in which time is a continuous variable. Those models can of course be simulated on computer using discretization schemes. For example, we choose a time step and compute the state of the network at time t+dt, from the state at time t. This algorithm, however, implements a simulation of the model; it is not the model that implements the algorithm. The discretization is nowhere to be found in the model. The model itself, being a continuous time dynamical system, is not algorithmic in nature. It is not described as a discrete sequence of operations; it is only the simulation of the model that is algorithmic, and different algorithms can simulate the same model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we put this confusion aside, then the claim that neural networks implement algorithms becomes not that obvious. It means that trajectories of the dynamical system can be mapped to the discrete flow of an algorithm. This requires: 1) to identify states with representations of some variables (for example stimulus properties, symbols); 2) to identify trajectories from one state to another as specific operations. In addition to that, for the algorithmic view to be of any use, there should be a sequence of operations, not just one operation (ie, describing the output as a function of the input is not an algorithmic description).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key difficulty in this identification is temporality: the state of the dynamical system changes continuously, so how can this be mapped to discrete operations? A typical approach is neuroscience is to consider not states but properties of trajectories. For example, one would consider the average firing rate in a population of neurons in a given time window, and the rate of another population in another time window. The relation between these two rates in the context of an experiment would define an operation. As stated above, a sequence of such relations should be identified in order to qualify as an algorithm. But this mapping seems only possible within a feedforward flow; coupling poses a greater challenge for an algorithmic description. No known nervous system, however, has a feedforward connectome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not claiming here that the function of the brain (or mind) cannot possibly be described algorithmically. Probably some of it can be. My point is rather that a dynamical system is not generically algorithmic. A control system, for example, is typically not algorithmic (see the detailed example of Tim van Gelder, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://people.bu.edu/pbokulic/class/vanGelder-reading.pdf&quot;&gt;What might cognition be if not computation?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;). Thus a neural dynamical system can only be seen as an algorithm at a fairly abstract level, which can probably address only a restricted subset of its function. It could be that control, which also attaches function to dynamical systems, is a more adequate metaphor of brain function than computation. Is the brain a computer? Given the rather narrow application of the algorithmic view, the reasonable answer should be: quite clearly not (maybe part of cognition could be seen as computation, but not brain function generally).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-5497 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/4986007994_13f1323839_z.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foods we eat can have a huge impact on our brain’s function. Neuroscientists show that rats fed junk foods &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/7/8/5307/htm&quot;&gt;struggle with memory tasks&lt;/a&gt;. We also know that memory function is impaired in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22023100&quot;&gt;people who eat junk foods&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of whether they are overweight or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But aside from cutting out junk foods, is there neuroscience-based evidence that specific foods can help boost brain function?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In part Part 5 of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/category/gut-brain-axis/&quot;&gt;series on the gut-brain axis&lt;/a&gt;, diet and brain health, Dr Amy Reichelt dicusses five “famous superfoods” that science shows can benefit your brain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blueberries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blueberries are often called a quintessential “superfood” because of their potent antioxidant properties. Berries, particularly blueberries, are rich in the compound &lt;em&gt;anthocyanin&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/52524-flavonoids.html&quot;&gt;flavonoid&lt;/a&gt; with potent antioxidant capacity. Anthocyanin is the chemical that gives many berries and fruits their bright purple or red colour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antioxidants combat the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20955649&quot;&gt;oxidation and inflammation that damages brain cells (neurons). &lt;/a&gt;Our stressful urban lifestyles can increase free radicals causing inflammation and neuron damage in the brain. So &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/antioxidants#lp-h-3&quot;&gt;diets high in antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; may help reverse mental decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Avocados&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avocados are high in monosaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). Diets high in MUFAs are often called “Mediterranean diets” and have documented benefits for the brain and cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MUFAs can increase the &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2012.07772.x/asset/j.1471-4159.2012.07772.x.pdf?v=1&amp;amp;t=jcy80el0&amp;amp;s=b43bab92a1b2d811a5cb78794e02baa76c9a0e20&amp;amp;systemMessage=Please+be+advised+that+we+experienced+an+unexpected+issue+that+occurred+on+Saturday+and+Sunday+January+20th+and+21st+that+caused+the+site+to+be+down+for+an+extended+period+of+time+and+affected+the+ability+of+users+to+access+content+on+Wiley+Online+Library.+This+issue+has+now+been+fully+resolved.++We+apologize+for+any+inconvenience+this+may+have+caused+and+are+working+to+ensure+that+we+can+alert+you+immediately+of+any+unplanned+periods+of+downtime+or+disruption+in+the+future.&quot;&gt;neurotransmitter acetylcholine&lt;/a&gt; in the brain. Acetylcholine is critical for learning, memory and concentration. Reduced brain acetylcholine contributes to the memory problems in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, avocados are a rich source folate, which is vital for neuronal signalling, and vitamin E, an antioxidant, which can help protect neurons from damaging free radicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oily fish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish such as sardines, salmon, mackerel and trout are excellent sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids, or PUFAs, specifically omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are especially important in our brains as they are major building blocks of the cell membrane that surrounds neurons. Increasing intake of omega-3 fatty acids helps neurons to function properly. As a result, diets high in omega-3s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16216930&quot;&gt;may slow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19523795&quot;&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; and could decrease the incidence of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Green Tea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people wake up in the morning and drink a cup of coffee or tea, which contains the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28990513&quot;&gt;cognitive stimulant&lt;/a&gt; caffeine. But green tea is also high in the amino acid L-theanine, which is important for producing the neurotransmitter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224499000448&quot;&gt;GABA.&lt;/a&gt; Increasing GABA in the brain can promote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28056735&quot;&gt;mental clarity and relaxation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matcha green tea is rich in L-theanine. Although matcha tea is high in caffeine, the abundance of L-theanine interacts with caffeine to avoid the “jitters” associated with excessive coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green tea is also high in antioxidants that have been linked to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15350981&quot;&gt;lower incidence of neurodegenerative diseases including&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19040558&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Turmeric&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turmeric is the curry spice that gives Indian foods their bright yellow colour. Turmeric contains curcumin, an anti-inflammatory noted for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27533649&quot;&gt;treating arthritis&lt;/a&gt;.  Curcumin can also exert anti-inflammatory actions in the brain and may be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29332042&quot;&gt;protective against Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory mice that eat diets supplemented with curcumin have &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0031211&quot;&gt;increased numbers of neurons&lt;/a&gt; (through a process called &lt;em&gt;neurogenesis&lt;/em&gt;) in the hippocampus, the key area of the brain responsible for memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tasty takeaways…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience shows that regularly eating these foods could boost your brain power for a happier, healthier mind. I hope you might try mixing them into your regular meals. Or you can use these scientific findings as a great excuse for smoked salmon and avocado on toast for brunch!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;It is almost philosophical to think that our mental representations, imagery, reasoning, and reflections are generated by electrical activity of interconnected brain cells. And even more so is to think that these abstract phenomena of the mind could be enhanced by passing electricity through specific cellular networks in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, it turns out these tenets can be subjected to empirical experimentation. Groundbreaking discoveries made by Dr. Wilder Penfield with his patients undergoing open-brain surgeries to treat epilepsy opened a new field of brain research exploring physiological substrates of human memory. By applying electrical current in discrete regions of the brain’s cortex, Penfield induced a conscious experience of facts and events from the recent and distant past. For instance, one of his patients described re-living a childhood episode of a circus show with the vividness of detail associated with such a unique and captivating event. This &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/86/4/595/321416?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;phenomenal effect of electrical stimulation&lt;/a&gt; on memory experience was described in a series of patients stimulated in different brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the effect was found in defined areas of the cortex when electrical current was applied with optimal frequency and amplitude parameters for inducing the memory experiences. This led Penfield and colleagues to hypothesize that the stimulation worked by activating some specific physiological substrates storing memory traces of the remembered events. The idea is brilliantly simple. Stimulating networks of brain cells at a set of parameters, which match their physiological activity when memories are encoded, can reverberate a memory trace and result in its conscious experience. Waves of the applied electrical current would in a way entrain and re-activate groups of connected cells supporting specific mental representations. Around the time of these experiments, Polish neurophysiologist Dr. Jerzy Konorski and Canadian neuropsychologist Dr. Donald Hebb independently proposed a mechanism through which such connected groups of cells, aka neuronal assemblies, could form &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://books.google.com/books/about/Integrative_activity_of_the_brain.html?id=atMdAAAAMAAJ&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the physiological substrate for our mental constructs&lt;/a&gt; and their memory traces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since these initial ideas and findings, technological progress has been made to &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763416306820&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;modulate these hypothetical substrates in attempt to enhance human memory performance&lt;/a&gt;. Several studies of individual cases or small groups of patients reported both positive and negative effects of electrical stimulation in a range of brain regions. The positive effect was manifested in improved reaction time or response accuracy in various tests probing spatial, semantic, and other forms of declarative memory for facts and events. Despite the mixed effects and other limitations in these pioneering studies, improving mental processes supporting memory performance with electrical stimulation became a tangible reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulating networks of brain cells at a set of parameters, which match their physiological activity when memories are encoded, can reverberate a memory trace and result in its conscious experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fascinating research can now be more robust and reproducible in the era of collaborative brain research projects. In our recent study, we used data collected from 22 patients stimulated in a range of brain regions during performance of a verbal memory task completed at multiple clinical centers. Four brain regions, which were previously implicated in declarative memory functions, were investigated for the effect of electrical stimulation on remembering lists of common words like “fish” or “rose.” We found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awx373/4793032&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more words were remembered when one of the studied regions was stimulated&lt;/a&gt; (overlapping with the cortical area originally identified by Penfield). Electrical current passed through that region enabled the patients to recall more words as their abstract mental representation (or concepts, if you like) were generated. This time it was not the reaction time or response accuracy that was improved, but the memory for additional concepts of words when electrically entraining that brain region. And so was the subjective experience of one of the patients who reported that it was “easier to picture those words” in his mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this is still far from addressing the Konorski and Hebb models, we also observed &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.eneuro.org/content/early/2018/01/24/ENEURO.0369-17.2018&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a parallel effect of the stimulation on brain oscillations in the “high gamma” frequencies&lt;/a&gt;—a proposed indicator of neuronal assembly activity. We know that this activity is physiologically induced in response to word presentation for memory encoding. Electrical stimulation in the reported brain region enhanced the high gamma response, specifically on trials with words that ended up being forgotten (i.e. the poor encoding trials). This modulation of the gamma response reflected the behavioral change in memory performance—increased response was observed with memory enhancement, whereas the decreased response with a worsened performance. Thus, a concrete physiological process was linked to the effect on remembering mental concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, bridging the gap between the human mind and brain may not be as philosophical of a task after all. There are now at our disposal robust paradigms, effective tools, and tangible brain targets to reach out to the realm of declarative memory and cognition. The promise of physical devices to treat the abstract is very real.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Corey Moran&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with nothing but an Expo marker, white board, and quick wits, Postdoctoral candidates wishing to effloresce into full-fledged scientists, have only 20 minutes in front of a panel of distinguished faculty to showcase their scientific acumen and outline an entire career’s worth of research goals. Infamously known by the colloquial name “Chalk Talk”, this informal yet demanding presentation requires the distillation of complex scientific research, effective and engaging communication, as well approachability and flexibility; all without the convenience or assistance of technology. What may seem like a daunting task is actually a very typical and crucial aspect of the interviewing process for aspiring scientists. Mastery over this 20 minute scientific gauntlet becomes a pivotal step in the career path of a Postdoc, progressing from novice trainee to adept scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jump from Postdoctoral Research Fellow to a tenured professorship, is a notoriously arduous transition. Due to an abundance of post Ph.D. trainees (Postdocs), dwindling university tenure availability and the current, competitive academic climate, this transition is certainly one of the most formidable obstacles facing those that aspire to one day become a Principal Investigator (PI). Despite the difficulty, determined researchers stave off discouragement to pursue the exceptional opportunity to one day lead their own lab and conduct their own research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this monumental goal, Postdocs must first complete a rigorous interviewing process consisting of: a formal, typically hour long, well-attended lecture centered around their research projects, rife with data, charts and scientific figures; the informal and intimate “Chalk Talk” given to a small panel of research faculty; as well as personal interviews with several scientists in the department. Developing the skills necessary to command each of the three unique interview types, is essential in order to quickly become a standout candidate. Training and conferring those critical skills to its Postdocs, MPFI’s recently formed Postdoctoral Association, is helping them conquer and excel in all facets of the interview process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assisting Postdocs in attaining their career goals is something that Dr. Paul Evans, Post-Doctoral Fellow and President of the MPFI Postdoc Association, considers to be a critically important role of the organization. He comments that since its inception, “The association has developed unique programs that are in place to foster a community among MPFI Postdocs and help acquire professional development skills that will prepare them for the next steps in a career in science.” Vital Initiatives like practice “Chalk Talks”, monthly journal clubs, and scientific presentation/ writing workshops are extremely advantageous opportunities for Postdocs to gain familiarity and practice with interviewing. Two talented, former Postdocs at MPFI noted in particular, that active participation in the Postdoc association enabled them to become successful in the interview process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drs. Won Chan Oh and Gordon Smith have recently traversed the transition between trainee and independent scientist, joining the faculty of distinguished universities and paving the way for future MPFI Postdocs. Dr. Oh, a former Postdoc in the Kwon Lab, joined the University of Colorado Denver, Department of Neuroscience as an assistant professor. In his new lab, Oh will build upon his previous work at MPFI in the Kwon lab, studying the role of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in developing neuronal circuitry using highly advanced imaging. Dr. Smith, a former Postdoc in the Fitzpatrick Lab, is now an assistant professor in the Department of Neuroscience at the University of Minnesota. Like Dr. Oh, Dr. Smith will incorporate the cutting-edge imaging techniques he learned and refined at MPFI to take a deeper look into the functional networks of the visual system in order to better elucidate how the brain processes vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actualizing their dreams of becoming PIs, Drs. Oh and Smith demonstrate that though difficult, even the dreaded “Chalk Talk” portion of the scientific interview is unmistakably conquerable with the right amount of practice, preparation and dedication. MPFI’s Postdoc Association is doing just that, helping to facilitate the future success of its members.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h4&gt;Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience showcased the science of songbird singing complimented by classical compositions inspired by the sonorous songsters.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early evening on Wednesday, April 18, science and song took flight in Benjamin Hall, as members of the local community, brimming with excitement, gathered for a night of virtuosic music and scientific discovery. Closing out the fifth season of Science Meets Music, the Max Planck Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) prepared a uniquely themed program centered around the beautiful and resonant melodies sung by birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing the scientific portion of the evening, was special guest lecturer Dr. Manfred Gahr, Ph.D., Director of the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, and expert in all things songbird. Dr. Gahr’s lecture titled “Seasonal Singing of Birds: From Gonads to the Brain” provided an interesting insight as to why singing is unique to male songbirds and why patterns of singing vary, depending on the current season. Additionally, Dr. Gahr touched on the mechanisms involved in the development of song producing neural circuits as well as areas of the brain in songbirds that are critical for learning different patterns of sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfectly accompanying Dr. Gahr’s captivating lecture, were superlative performances by musical guest, the Palm Beach Symphony Chamber Ensemble. In their bookending recitals, the masterful string quartet played movements from the well-known Vivaldi concerto “Spring”, part of the larger work “The Four Seasons” as well as Haydn’s String Quartet in D major, Op. 64, No. 5 appropriately nicknamed “Lark.” Palm Beach Symphony principal cello, Claudio Jaffé provided enlightening commentary about the composers and their music before each piece. Guests in attendance were awed by the quartet’s musicianship, precision and uncanny ability to mimic the light, airy and vibrant nature of a songbird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing the chamber ensemble, Executive Director of the Palm Beach Symphony, David McClymont, spoke of the commonalities between MPFI’s and Palm Beach Symphony’s mission statements, commenting that “A big part of Palm Beach Symphony’s mission is to educate, entertain and engage. We feel that tonight is a perfect opportunity to combine all three of those pillars, collaborating with such a brilliant community partner as Max Planck Florida, who holds very similar ideals to ours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the curtain has been drawn on the current season of Science Meets Music, music enthusiasts and science seekers fret not. Due to overwhelmingly popular demand, Science Meets Music will return in 2019 for its sixth season. Be sure to keep a look out this coming fall, as more information will be released detailing event scheduling as well as the 2019 speaker and musical performance lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About – Palm Beach Symphony&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission of Palm Beach Symphony is to engage, educate and entertain the greater community of the Palm Beaches through live performances of inspiring orchestral music. The Symphony was founded in 1974 in recognition of the need for a professional orchestra in Palm Beach. Today, the Palm Beach Symphony has grown into a world-class orchestra with an expanded mission that includes carefully crafted education and community outreach programs that bring live classical music and concerts into schools, community centers, and public venues in and around the Palm Beaches. The orchestra is celebrated for delivering spirited and exacting performances led by Artistic &amp;amp; Music Director Ramón Tebar, while the organization continues to expand its music education and community outreach programs with children’s concerts, student coaching sessions and masterclasses, instrument donations and free public concerts.

&lt;p&gt;The learning-by-teaching effect has been demonstrated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/00028312019002237&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X13000209&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;. Students who spend time teaching what they’ve learned go on to show better understanding and knowledge retention than students who simply spend the same time re-studying. What remains unresolved, however, is exactly why teaching helps the teacher better understand and retain what they’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acp.3410?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Applied Cognitive Psychology&lt;/i&gt; researchers led by Aloysius Wei Lun Koh set out to test their theory that teaching improves the teacher’s learning because it compels the teacher to retrieve what they’ve previously studied. In other words, they believe the learning benefit of teaching is simply another manifestation of the well-known “testing effect” – the way that bringing to mind what we’ve previously studied leads to deeper and longer-lasting acquisition of that information than more time spent passively re-studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33821&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 124 students and asked them spend ten minutes studying a text, with accompanying figures, about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect&quot;&gt;Doppler Effect&lt;/a&gt; and soundwaves – a topic about which none of them had any previous knowledge – with a view to teaching the material themselves afterwards without notes. Participants were told they could take notes while studying but not keep them for the next stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the study phase, the participants were divided into four groups. In one group participants spent five minutes being filmed alone while they stood and delivered a lesson on the study material without notes (they could use a blank flip chart to draw figures if they wanted). The other groups either spent the same time completing multiplication arithmetic; standing up and teaching verbatim from a set script (including making reference to pre-drawn figures on a white board); or writing down all they could remember from the text (i.e. a form of retrieval practice designed to induce the testing effect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later, all the participants returned to the lab for a surprise test of their knowledge and comprehension of the original study text in the form of six free-response questions that required them to explain key concepts from the study materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical finding is that the teaching-without-notes group outperformed the group that had spent the same time completing arithmetic problems and the group that had taught from a script, but so too did the group who simply spent the same time retrieving what they’d learned. In fact, the final comprehension performance of the teaching-without-notes group and the retrieval-practice group was comparable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said their results suggest that “the benefits of the learning-by-teaching strategy are attributable to retrieval practice; that is, the robust learning-by-teaching strategy works but only when the teaching involves &lt;i&gt;retrieving&lt;/i&gt; the taught materials.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings don’t undermine the notion of teaching as an effect learning method, but they have practical implications for how the learning-by-teaching approach is applied in education and training. “In order to insure that students and tutors learn and retain the educational material that they have prepared and presented in class, they ought to internalize the to-be-presented material prior to communicating it to an audience, rather than rely on study notes during the presentation process”, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critical readers may take issue with the lack of realism in the study – there was no audience of learners in either of the teaching conditions and therefore no interaction, which surely also plays a part in the learning benefits of teaching. Also, participants in all groups were originally primed to expect to have to teach the material, which may have had learning benefits in itself – perhaps the retrieval group would not have matched the comprehension of the teaching-without-notes group without being primed in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lun Koh and colleagues acknowledged some of these issues and they called on further research to “assess the importance of retrieval practice across a variety of teaching scenarios and activities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acp.3410?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;The learning benefits of teaching: A retrieval practice hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ten research directions for the NeuroMat team in the coming years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 15px;&quot;&gt;As the NeuroMat research team worked on the project renewal proposal, ten research teams were listed. These teams have specific research topics, that will in the coming years provide the direction of the RIDC agenda. These teams were normally already active prior to 2018.

 &lt;p&gt;Creativity research has come of age. Today, the nature of the creative process is investigated with every tool of modern cognitive neuroscience: neuroimaging, genetics, computational modeling, among them. Yet the brain mechanisms of creativity remain a mystery and the studies of the brains of “creative” individuals have so far failed to produce conclusive results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the mystery is gradually yielding ground. As we are reconceptualizing creativity as a complex, and arguably derivative construct consisting of many moving parts, we are beginning to study these moving parts in a systematic way. The old tabloid clichés linking creativity to specific brain structures are no longer tenable, but they do seem to have captured some important aspects of the underlying neurobiological processes. We no longer believe that creativity “resides” in the right hemisphere, but evidence is growing that the right hemisphere is particularly adept at dealing with novelty, an important ingredient of any creative process. In contrast, the left hemisphere appears to be the repository of well-entrenched knowledge and skills, verbal and non-verbal alike, which is an equally important prerequisite of a creative process (remember the giants on whose shoulders we all stand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a radical departure from the old notion linking the left hemisphere to language and right hemisphere to non-verbal visuo-spatial processes, and it elucidates the complementary roles of the two cerebral hemispheres in the creative process. Furthermore, the complementary roles of the two hemispheres in supporting novelty vs well-routinized cognitive skills appears to be present across a wide range of species, not just primates, but other mammalians. They are present even in species whose brains are devoid of developed cortex and rely instead on the phylogenetically ancient principle consisting of relatively “modular” nuclei, such as birds (and by extension probably in dinosaurs). Such evolutionary continuities open the door for the studies of the evolutionary precursors for forebears of human creativity. Likewise, it is no longer tenable to view the frontal lobes as the “seat” of creativity, but evidence is growing in linking the frontal lobes to processing cognitive novelty. The frontal lobes, or, more precisely, the prefrontal cortex, is also critical for salience judgment, the ability to decide what is important and what is not. This ability is essential for the creative process, lest the creative mind strays into innovative but inconsequential esoterica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer believe that creativity “resides” in the right hemisphere, but evidence is growing that the right hemisphere is particularly adept at dealing with novelty, an important ingredient of any creative process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But understanding the workings of the mind behind the innovation is only part of the challenge facing creativity research. In a society infused with innovation at an increasingly accelerating rate, understanding its impact on the consumer becomes particularly important. In the not-so-distant past, a human being could acquire a repertoire of knowledge and skills in one’s youth and coast on that knowledge for the rest of one’s life. This was true even for professionals engaged in seemingly daunting intellectual activities. In reality, however, a physician or an engineer could operate throughout much of their professional career on a “mental autopilot,” without much need to update their professional knowledge or skills. This was even more the case for a person’s ability to navigate daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today new technologies and knowledge saturate society at such a rate&lt;del&gt;,&lt;/del&gt; that even the laziest and least intellectually inclined among us are forced to absorb innovation all the time, whether we like it or not, both in our professional activities and in everyday life. The ever-accelerating rate of innovation places unprecedented demands on its consumer and makes the consumer a real partner in the process to a degree unprecedented in the history of our species. When you see an octogenarian using an iPhone or an iPad, you can safely assume that she did not grow up with either of these hi-tech devices, that nothing in her early background prepared her for the flood of new electronic technologies, yet here she is, operating them confidently and competently. How does the human brain function in this new environment? How does it develop and how does it age? How do these radical changes in the degree of novelty exposure change the nature of psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as dementia?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in our increasingly technological world, the question of Artificially Intelligent (AI) creativity inevitably arises. Offensive as this may sound to the more exceptionalism-mined members of our own species, if creativity is defined as a conjunction of novelty and societal relevance, then the authorship of the creative process should not be part of its definition. Until now, AI has focused on the design of dedicated devices each adept at performing a pre-specified, relatively narrow class of task. But more recently the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) movement is gathering speed with an audacious goal of designing artificial devices capable of open-ended learning and yes, creative processes. Today, AI-generated art, both paintings and music, has been judged by human connoisseurs as “creative.” How we, the biological humans, will fit into this brave new world and how we’ll be changed by it, is yet another question for future creativity research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In research published in the 1990s, psychologists asked people to list their biggest regrets in life and found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1995-05382-001&quot;&gt;they tended to mention things they hadn’t done, rather than things they had&lt;/a&gt;.  Now, one of the psychologists behind that seminal research – Thomas Gilovich at Cornell University – together with his colleague Shai Davidai at The New School for Social Research – have looked into the content of people’s regrets, as opposed to how they were brought about (by action or inaction). Across six studies, the pair present new evidence, &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-21180-001&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that our most enduring regrets concern not living up to our ideal selves (i.e. not becoming the person we wanted to be), as opposed to not living according to our “ought selves” (the person we should have been based on our duties and responsibilities).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33818&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers surveyed hundreds of participants, including students, but mostly members of the public recruited on Amazon’s survey website. For most of the studies, the researchers started out telling their recruits the difference between regrets concerning the “ideal self” (not achieving goals they had set for themselves, their dreams and ambitions) and “the ought self” (not meeting the norms and rules they had for themselves or fulfilling their obligations to others), before asking them to list, name and categorise their regrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the different studies, the participants said they experienced regrets concerning their ideal self more often (72 per cent vs. 28 per cent); they mentioned more ideal-self regrets than ought-self regrets when asked to list their regrets in life so far (57 per cent vs. 43 per cent); and when asked to name their single biggest regret in life, participants were more likely to mention a regret about not fulfilling their ideal self (76 per cent vs. 24 per cent mentioning an ought-self regret).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilovich and Davidai next tested their belief that a key reason why ideal-self regrets are more enduring is that we are less likely to take practical and psychological action at the time to repair these regrets, compared with ought-self regrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, presented with hypothetical ideal-self regrets (such as forsaken dreams or romantic interests not pursued) and hypothetical ought-self regrets (like failing to visit a dying relative or infidelity), participants said a typical person was more likely to take action, psychological and practical, to repair the ought-self regrets, such as by finding a silver lining or doing something to dampen the regret, than to repair ideal-self regrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up study, participants described actual regrets they had, either ideal-self related or ought-self related, and said what they’d done to cope with them. Those asked to describe ought-self regrets rated them as having been more urgent and said they’d taken more steps to cope, including changing their behaviour, rectifying the situation or undoing it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the researchers switched things up and asked 157 more participants to recall a resolved regret or an unresolved regret (“unfinished business”) – they found those asked to write about the former were more likely to describe an ought-self regret, while those asked to write about the latter were more likely to describe an ideal-self regret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilovich and Davidai and are not saying that the only reason that ideal-self regrets are more enduring is because we are less likely to attend to them and resolve them, but they think this is a key factor in why they are generally more bothersome and come more readily to mind. Other possible reasons (not tested in the current research) are that our ideal selves are simply less obtainable than our ought selves, more abstract, and less context dependent, meaning regrets pertaining to them are triggered more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our work is the first to show that people’s most prominent life regrets more often involve failures to live up to their ideal self than their ought self,” the researchers concluded. And they added the work “… is the first to document the role played by behavioural and psychological coping mechanisms in people’s tendency to regret their failures to live up to their ideal selves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new results are backed up by anecdotal accounts from patients nearing the end of their lives, described &lt;a href=&quot;https://bronnieware.com/regrets-of-the-dying/&quot;&gt;in a book&lt;/a&gt; by palliative nurse Bronnie Ware in 2013: “When people realise that their life is almost over and look back clearly on it, it is easy to see how many dreams have gone unfulfilled,” she wrote. “Most people had not honoured even a half of their dreams and had to die knowing that it was due to choices that they had made, or not made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we take any practical insights from the latest findings? Gilovich and Davidai urge caution, suggesting that the most advisable way to live will depend on how much weight you place on your ought self vs. your ideal self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you place a premium on your ought self, you “would be wise to minimise [your] regrets by thinking twice before forging ahead [and seizing the moment]” they suggest. On the other hand, “if one is an adventurous soul guided by her ideal self, she might indeed end up happier by seizing the day and not looking back. As we have shown in this research, a person focused on her ideal self is more likely to lose sleep over her ‘wouldas’ and ‘couldas’ than her ‘shouldas’.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re at a ten-pin bowling alley with some friends, you bowl your first ball – and it’s a strike. Do you instantly grin with delight? Not according to a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699930302288&quot;&gt; study of bowlers&lt;/a&gt;, who smiled not at a moment of triumph but rather when they pivoted in their lanes, to look at their fellow bowlers.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That study provided the earliest evidence for a controversial hypothesis, the Behavioural Ecology View (BECV) of facial displays, outlined in detail in a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/references/S1364-6613(18)30029-9&quot;&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Trends in Cognitive Sciences&lt;/i&gt;. Carlos Crivelli at De Montfort University, Leicester, UK and Alan Fridlund at the University of California, Santa Barbara, put forward the case that facial displays are not universal, “pre-wired” expressions of emotion – a concept supported by 80 per cent of emotion researchers in a recent poll – but are flexible tools for influencing the behaviour of other people.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33793&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same range of specific facial displays have been associated with anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness and surprise in many different cultures. As Paul Ekman at the University of California, San Francisco – the best-known proponent of the “basic emotions theory” or BET – writes in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paulekman.com/uncategorized/darwins-claim-universals-facial-expression-challenged/&quot;&gt;blog post:&lt;/a&gt; “The capacity for humans in radically different cultures to label facial expressions with terms from a list of emotion terms has replicated nearly 200 hundred times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Crivelli and Fridlund write in their paper: “Despite its popularity, the assumptions and prescriptions of BET are meeting unprecedented challenges.” They argue that there are “serious methodological problems” in the initial studies on indigenous societies, and point to “countervailing” data from more recent studies, also conducted on small-scale indigenous societies, one Melanesian (the Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea) and two African (the Himba of Namibia and the Mwani of Mozambique).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data gathered in the past five years from these societies are “inconsistent with the universality thesis”, the pair write. For instance, when Trobrianders are presented with the “gasping face”, which is usually taken as expressing fear, they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27791137?dopt=Abstract&quot;&gt;perceive it as a “threatening” face&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the BET, this is an example of an unusual local cultural influence. But Crivelli and Fridlund aren’t convinced. They point to data showing that the gasping face is used as a threat display also in several African, Amazonian and Pacific small-scale indigenous societies.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mismatches on the original face studies were always attributed to thin, cultural rule-governed overlays,” they write. But, they argue “Those deviations, just like the new evidence found in African and Melanesian populations may indicate &lt;i&gt;fundamental&lt;/i&gt; [my italics] human diversity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true that people from many different countries associate smiles with happiness (the Trobrianders are, in fact, a notable exception), but this has more to do with convergent genetic and cultural evolution, Crivelli and Fridlund argue, than to do with smiles being some kind of involuntary, hard-wired read-out of positive emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does what we know about babies’ facial displays and emotions feed into this debate? Babies often smile when they see a family member or pet. They wrinkle their nose and protrude their tongue when given food they don’t like. Their eyes open wide at loud noises. And their mouths turn down when they cry. But according to BECV, this doesn’t necessarily mean that these are expressions of the emotions of happiness, disgust, fear or sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the BECV, which holds that these displays have not evolved to provide a fixed read-out of internal states but rather to influence the behaviour of other people, common facial displays are seen as having the following communicative functions – in adults, as well (the more traditional BET interpretation of the corresponding felt emotion is in brackets):&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smile – (Happiness) – Influence interactant to play or affiliate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pouting – (Sadness) – Recruit interactant’s succour or protection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scowling – (Anger) – Influence interactant to submit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gasping – (Fear) – Deflect interactant’s attack via one’s own submission or incipient retreat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nose scrunching – (Disgust) – Reject current interaction trajectory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neutral – (“Suppressed emotion” or no emotion) – Lead the interactant nowhere in interaction trajectory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may well be that when we’re in a positive mood state, we’re more open to interacting and affiliating with others – and more likely to smile. But we all sometimes – or even often – smile when we’re not &lt;i&gt;feeling&lt;/i&gt; happy. According to the BET, these are insincere smiles. But if the purpose of a smile is to encourage other people to interact and affiliate (when meeting new people for the first time, say, or walking into an important meeting), they aren’t insincere at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their paper, Fridlund and Crivelli also point to a re-conceiving of animal facial (and postural) displays as an “ecology of signalling”, based on the interests of the displayers and the receivers, who all have their own histories of interaction and who must negotiate for advantages within their group and their environment. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some research (such as the bowling study) that finds we are more likely to use facial displays – or that the displays are more pronounced – when we’re with other people. But one criticism of the BECV approach is that we do smile, grimace and frown when we are alone. Crivelli and Fridlund argue that while we may be alone physically we are never “psychologically alone”. “Our cast of interactants may include fantasised humans, real non-humans, humans who are not proximal, or any nearby objects”, they write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this won’t be the BECV argument that doubters will find hardest to accept. BECV will always be a tough sell, Crivelli and Fridlund note, in part because it’s more demanding to investigate experimentally than BET, and also, they argue, because “BECV requires shaking off a romanticised view of human nature…that makes the face a battleground between an interior ‘authentic self’ and an external, impression-managed ‘social self’…Within BECV both ‘selves’ are illusory. We are unified organisms, and like our words, voices and gestures, our facial displays are part of our plans of action in social commerce.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it isn’t only the BET itself that BECV challenges. What about the body of work on the role of facial displays in triggering emotion contagion? Or in empathy, for that matter.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; The BECV is fascinating&lt;/span&gt;. But to call it “controversial” is probably an understatement.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Mindfulness Mediation&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/Mindfullness-Meditation-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is fair to say that mindfulness meditation has become a mainstream technique in the toolkit of psychologists and others working in various settings across the world. It has made its way from clinical environments, such as the hospital or therapy room, to our schools, our workplaces and our universities. But what evidence is there for its usefulness in these different contexts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving away from clinical environments has meant moving away from a reliance on clinical effects to justify the implementation of mindfulness meditation interventions. Now, mindfulness meditation is not only linked to decreased stress and relapse of mood disorders, it is also claimed that mindfulness meditation results in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14681994.2012.748889&quot;&gt;better relationships&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/523f28fce4b0f99c83f055f2/t/52d92a65e4b04d4af95709ed/1389963877991/VanDoesumVanLangeJPSP2013.pdf&quot;&gt;more prosocial behaviour&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-34922-001&quot;&gt;higher job satisfaction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027273581000173X&quot;&gt;more focused attention, greater memory skills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://prsinstitute.org/downloads/related/spiritual-sciences/meditation/TowardtheIntegrationofMeditationintoHigherEducation.pdf&quot;&gt;improved critical thinking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, how strong is the evidence for these claims? Take the research on relationships and pro-social behaviour – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20299-z&quot;&gt;a recent meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated that evidence for these benefits falls away when studies use stronger methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindfulness meditation and cognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the other claims regarding the benefits of mindfulness meditation relate to cognitive ability. These claims can be divided into those pertaining to lower-order cognitive functions, such as perception, attention and automatic responses (as Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman would say, thinking fast), and higher-order thinking skills such as problem-solving, decision-making and, in general, critical thinking (or thinking slow).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since mindfulness, as it is taught in Western psychology, relies heavily on cultivating acceptance, it may have a negative effect on the tendency to think critically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were particularly interested in the claims that mindfulness may benefit critical thinking for two reasons. One, critical thinking is a hugely important set of skills to cultivate in society so it is important that we understand whether interventions aimed at improving critical thinking work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, there is a potential paradox within the claim that mindfulness may facilitate critical thinking. Since mindfulness, as it is taught in Western psychology, relies heavily on cultivating acceptance, it may have a negative effect on the tendency to think critically. Critical thinking fundamentally requires &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;accepting information without questioning it. Interestingly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.02043/full&quot;&gt;a cross-sectional study&lt;/a&gt; we conducted showed both positive and negative effects of the tendency to be mindful on performance in a critical thinking task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We followed this up with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-017-0789-8&quot;&gt;lab-based experiment&lt;/a&gt; on the effects of a single guided mindfulness meditation in comparison to a guided sham meditation – something that sounded like mindfulness meditation but without the specific instructions on how to control your attention. In this experiment, there was no overall benefit of being randomised to the mindfulness meditation group. However, those in the mindfulness meditation group who were less disposed towards putting effort into critical thinking and those who were less open-minded did experience some improvement in critical thinking performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing effectiveness of mindfulness meditation on cognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-018-0226-3?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Psychology-Psychiatry/Psychology-Global&amp;amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_MAY2018_Mindfullness&quot;&gt;Our latest paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describes the strongest test of claims regarding mindfulness and critical thinking thus far. Across 6 weeks, we tested t&lt;img alt=&quot;College student&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10118 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/College-student-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;he effects of regular mindfulness meditation against the effects of engaging in a sham meditation – listening to a recording which was ostensibly a guided mindfulness meditation – among a sample of university students. We focused on students not just out of convenience but also because a report on the integration of meditation practices in to higher education had suggested doing so would improve critical thinking among students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ninety students were randomly assigned to either the mindfulness meditation group or the sham meditation group. Importantly, neither the students nor the researchers were aware of which group the participants were in, and the participants were under the impression that both conditions involved equally effective meditation techniques.&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt; In other words, the study was a randomised controlled trial with a double blind methodology which was also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-016-0122-7&quot;&gt;pre-registered&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to achieve this rigour by partnering with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.headspace.com/&quot;&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt;, a company which produces the world’s most popular mindfulness mediation app. This allowed us to collect objective adherence data and meant that our method of delivering the guided meditations was ecologically valid, since apps are one of the most popular ways of learning to meditate. We even got Andy Puddicombe, co-founder of Headspace, to record our sham meditation script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allowed us to collect objective adherence data and meant that our method of delivering the guided meditations was ecologically valid, since apps are one of the most popular ways of learning to meditate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome measures of primary interest in this study were mindfulness, executive functioning, critical thinking and two dispositions towards critical thinking – actively open-minded thinking and need for cognition. According to theories in cognitive psychology which focus on fast and slow thinking, known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dual-process-theory-Evans_Stanovich_PoPS13.pdf&quot;&gt;dual process theories&lt;/a&gt;, executive function is the mechanism through which responses generated through fast thinking are inhibited which allows slow thinking, such as critical thinking, to occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results did not support the claim that regular mindfulness meditation practice improves critical thinking. We found that both mindfulness meditation and sham meditation resulted in equal improvements in critical thinking over the course of the stud&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;y. Therefore, there was no effect specific to the practice of mindfulness meditation. We believe that there are a number of possible explanations for this finding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results did not support the claim that regular mindfulness meditation practice improves critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely that the improvement in both groups can be attributed to a mixture of demand characteristics (i.e. participants changing their responses in line with what they expect the study results to be) and a placebo effect. In relation to the mindfulness outcome measure, it is also possible that the mindfulness questionnaire we used is not sensitive enough to detect changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psychometric properties of this and many other mindfulness questionnaires are questionable and it is probable that the best we can hope to measure with such questionnaires is “perceived mindfulness”. In general, there is a great need for improvement in the methodological quality of mindfulness research, particularly in terms of measurement and experimental control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;In summary, th&lt;/span&gt;ere have been many unsupported and unchallenged claims regarding the supposed benefits of mindfulness practice, as it is taught in Western psychology, and a big industry has been built on the shaky foundation of these claims. We have demonstrated that it is possible to identify these claims and apply rigorous research methods to determine whether they are supported or not. Mindfulness research must continue to use randomized control trials, double blinding, and objective measurements of adherence and outcomes of the intervention for claims regarding mindfulness practice to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/04/Power-to-the-Preprint_blog-image-002-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preprints are here!!! Starting today authors submitting their manuscript to most PLOS journals* can also choose to post their article on bioRxiv, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory’s preprint server for the life sciences. This is an important development for both PLOS, for bioRxiv, for the authors we serve, and for the life sciences. For PLOS, it enables us to achieve a long-standing aspect of our vision to make research more quickly available to enable discovery and reuse.  For bioRxiv, this development will augment the server’s already rapidly climbing manuscript submission rate. And authors will gain the opportunity of sharing their work before peer review on a trusted platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Collaborating with bioRxiv is part of a much bigger strategy for PLOS moving forward, one in which we’ll renew our roots of being a catalytic open publisher” said Alison Mudditt, CEO of PLOS. “To accelerate innovation, we’ll often act in partnership with others in the community, which will move us closer to our vision of how scientific communication should work.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We warmly welcome the further integration of PLOS journals with bioRxiv,” said John Inglis, co-founder of bioRxiv. “The server’s goal is the acceleration of research and providing unrestricted access to manuscripts before they enter an often lengthy process of peer review is one of several ways bioRxiv is delivering on its promise.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what are preprints exactly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A preprint is an openly available scientific manuscript that an author uploads to a public server like bioRxiv prior to peer review. The preprint contains data and methodologies and is typically the same manuscript that is submitted to a journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why are preprints important?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for starters, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/04/one-small-step-for-preprints-one-giant-step-forward-for-open-scientific-communications/&quot;&gt;early sharing&lt;/a&gt; of ideas can lead to new discoveries and collaboration, and early feedback can help improve your manuscript. We are committed to putting your science first. By allowing a submission to be posted on bioRxiv, authors accelerate the dissemination of their work and invite commentary by a broader community, which PLOS editors may evaluate as part of peer review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will it work?&lt;/strong&gt; This graphic is a visual representation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/04/Snip-4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8201&quot; height=&quot;652&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/04/Snip-4.png&quot; width=&quot;1098&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, PLOS will perform initial manuscript screening compatible with bioRxiv standards, covering appropriate scope and article type, plagiarism detection, and other basic ethical and technical criteria. Articles will then post to the bioRxiv server and be freely accessible online. Authors must choose to opt-in to this preprint process when they submit papers to PLOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When sharing this post on Facebook or Twitter please use the hashtag #powertothepreprint to help increase visibility and awareness for preprints. Publish with PLOS and post your preprint on bioRxiv and let’s keep science open, and accessible, together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine &lt;/em&gt;continues to permit authors to post preprints of their research, but given particular &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002563&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; related to research in human health, will not initially be offering transfer of submitted manuscripts to bioRxiv.  &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; also continues to encourage authors to post preprints and will enable this automated preprint posting service to submitting authors in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h4&gt;And the hunt for its neural causes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8atjnMgv1YE7waQcX5HYaA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Neural detectives. Credit: Pixabay/www_sion_pics&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all started with ketamine. To some, vets mainly, it’s a horse tranquilliser. To others, a party drug. To those with severe clinical depression, a potential, literal, life-saver. A dose of ketamine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/03/depression-medication-fda-psychadelics-ketamine-psilocybin-johnson-and-johnson-mdma&quot;&gt;can rapidly dull&lt;/a&gt; the symptoms of depression, providing immediate relief for those crippled by the darkest thoughts. And while ketamine does not work for everyone, it seems to work in many people who are untouched by standard anti-depressant drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketamine could then be our best lead in the hunt for depression. For if we search for where ketamine affects the brain, and for how it affects the brain, we will get vital clues to the cause of depression. And so to a long-lasting effective treatment. Two studies just published in &lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;used precisely this trick, and spectacularly uncovered not just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25509&quot;&gt;compelling evidence&lt;/a&gt; of the tiny brain region to target, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25752&quot;&gt;exactly what goes wrong&lt;/a&gt; in it to create depression — that some neurons are, literally, depressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hunt for depression is a tricky case for any neural detective. Your brain has 86 billion neurons. Where to start looking for suspects? Well, let’s think about that for a second. We want somewhere in the brain that can control how you feel things are going — that things are sometimes better than expected, and worth enjoying. And somewhere in the brain that has something to do with serotonin, because the long-standing treatment for clinical depression are “SSRIs”, drugs that make more serotonin available by stopping it from being mopped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter the lateral habenula. Rolls off the tongue, doesn’t it? But it fits the suspect’s profile. It connects to both serotonin and dopamine releasing neurons. When dopamine neurons burst with activity, that’s a signal we just got something better than expected (serotonin neurons might &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/06346&quot;&gt;signal a similar thing&lt;/a&gt;). And when the lateral habenula releases a burst of activity, it stops the dopamine and serotonin neurons from bursting. Stops them from telling the brain — hey, that was unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, usually, this is for the common good. The lateral habenula sends the signal that what just happened was, in fact, expected. So you, little dopamine neuron, and you, precious serotonin neuron, do not need to burst — everything is as it is should be. With this signal from the habenula, your brain knows the world is predictable, and can go about its business; if every little thing was signalled as being surprising, you’d spend all day giggling and kicking things to see what they did. You’d be a three year old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when we look in the brains of depressed mice, we see their lateral habenula is bursting more than usual. Much more. The “nothing surprising” signal is being sent far too much, and at the wrong time. The dopamine and serotonin neurons cannot frolic and play. The brain is robbed of some key signals that life is worth pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We suspect the lateral habenula based on this strong circumstantial evidence, that it connects to the right things and its signals go haywire in depressed mice. Now to get a conviction we need more than circumstantial evidence. We need probable cause: does ketamine stop the bursting and remove depression? And we need motive: what drives the habenula to increase its bursting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two studies in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; from Hailan Hu and team answered both questions. Let’s start, as they did, with probable cause: if we stick ketamine into the habenula, does it alleviate depression? Yes. Depressed rats recover. In a bunch of tests, injecting ketamine into the habenula restores a rat’s élan: exploring, reacting, enjoying the taste of sweet sweet sucrose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(And this is true in a type of depressed mouse too. No one believes for a second that rats or mice experience the range of difficult and terrible thoughts accompanying clinical depression in people. So finding a common effect across quite different species of rodent, each type replicating different aspects of the human disorder, is key to believing that all this work has something to do with depression.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right, so ketamine can work its magic from within the habenula. But we want evidence that it has any effect on the habenula itself. For, surely, if that over-active bursting of the habenula in some way causes depression then ketamine should clobber the bursts? Remarkably, it does. Ketamine reduces the number of bursting neurons, right down to the same number found in healthy brains. We now have a big wodge of evidence for a probable cause of depression: habenula neurons burst fire when they should not, and stopping this bursting with ketamine stops depression (in tiny rodents).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better, because we know how ketamine attaches itself to a neuron (to NMDA receptors, if you like such things), Hu’s team could work out which specific hole in the neuron’s skin was being opened to cause the bursting. Ketamine stopped the hole from opening. Which means we now have a specific target to build anti-depressant drugs for: to stop this hole, this channel, from opening too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah, but we can do even better than that. Hu and team then went after the motive, asking why the habenula neurons were bursting too much in the first place. Why is this channel open when it should not be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first clue was in an odd property of the neurons that burst in the habenula. When doing nothing at all, these neurons were more depressed than the others. Neurons at rest have a characteristic, tiny voltage, a voltage created by the difference between how many ions are in them and how many are outside them. The habenula’s bursting neurons had a lower voltage when resting than the others. And this lower voltage means the channel that makes bursts is primed, ready to open; when the voltage is higher, the channel is turned off. Guess what? In depressed rats, there are more depressed neurons in the habenlua. Ergo, there are too many neurons ready to burst without provocation, at the wrong time, and in the wrong place.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Almost there, we almost have the motive. What then caused there to be too many depressed neurons? Well, whatever controls the difference between ions inside and outside a neuron. And that turned out to be the other cells in the brain, the ones that aren’t neurons. The unsung below-stairs staff that tidy up the mess, fix the broken crockery, and keep the food and drink flowing. The glia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hu’s team found that wrapped around each habenula neuron is a special glia cell. That glia cell’s job is to clear potassium away from around the neuron. (Potassium being one of the key ions that makes neurons work properly — eat bananas, people.) In depressed mice, that glia cell was too good at its job. It mopped up way more potassium than it should (if you care about these things, it over-expressed the KIR4.1 channel. Happy now?). And what does less potassium outside the neuron mean? Yep: the neuron has a lower voltage at rest. The motive is clear: an overly-enthusiastic glia cell is sweeping away far more potassium than it should, making its neuron neighbour depressed, so depressed it bursts when it should not; and this bursting is, it seems, a cause of what we call depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is this knowledge even better? Ah, because now we can search for drugs to target the specific mechanism that goes wrong, in those specific types of glia cells, drugs that aim to rebalance potassium around those neurons. Indeed, Hu and team used genetic tricks to bodge or block the glia cell’s mechanism in their mice, and voila! Bursting returned to normal and the mice recovered their elan. And having such a specific drug target is fantastic, as the more precise the tool for the job, the easier it is to avoid unpleasant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caveat emptor. Let’s list all the things that get in the way of this being the best thing since Pop Tarts. For a start, these are rats and mice. It is notoriously tricky to translate findings in rodents into something that works in humans. Very few drugs that work in rodents become successful drugs in humans. The endless failures of clinical trials for Alzheimer’s is proof enough of that. Another blip is that there is evidently a whole other story to play out, of how these glia go wrong in the first place — and how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2018/jan/08/is-everything-johann-hari-knows-about-depression-wrong-lost-connections&quot;&gt;the well-documented roles&lt;/a&gt; of stress, life-events, and predisposing genes all contribute. On top of that, ketamine does not work in all people; so this cannot be the cause of depression&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it seems unlikely that there is one single cause. And the fact ketamine works is hopeful. Hu and team have found wonderfully specific targets to test. If this does not turn out to be a major part of the solution to clinical depression, it gives many ideas of what could be the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very little of this work would have been possible without basic science, without science that is not driven by immediate goals of studying disease. Take for example the clues that the lateral habenula could be important. These come from people studying how the brain learns. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/s/theories-of-mind/did-i-do-that-636a7f2b0520&quot;&gt;well developed theory&lt;/a&gt; for how the firing of dopamine neurons controls learning. This theory prompted major efforts to understand: well, what controls the firing of dopamine neurons? And here was unearthed the lateral habenula, an obscure part of the brain of late, languishing unloved, now risen to prominence. And a few more examples of the contributions of basic science for good measure: the tests of the rats’ behaviour to work out how depressed they were; or how to record the bursting in neurons; or how to test the channel that causes the bursting. All these, and more, come from people driven by curiosity, not by being told to work on a specific disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For we can never know what will be key to unlocking the mystery of a brain disorder. But as Hu and team dramatically demonstrated, when we get a sniff of a clue, we can grab all our accumulated scientific know-how, tricks, and tools and use them to turn one small clue into a sprawling case for the prosecution. The game is afoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want more?
