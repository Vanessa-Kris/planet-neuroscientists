 &lt;p&gt;New research shows that we can “train our brains” to become memory champions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To many of us, having to memorize a long list of items feels like a chore. But for others, it is more like a sport. Every year, hundreds of these ‘memory athletes’ compete with one another in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldmemorychampionships.com/&quot;&gt;World Memory Championships&lt;/a&gt;, memorising hundreds of words, numbers, or other pieces of information within minutes. The current world champion is &lt;a href=&quot;https://mullenmemory.com/&quot;&gt;Alex Mullen&lt;/a&gt;, who beat his competitors by memorizing a string of more than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/lessons-from-americas-first-memory-world-champion&quot;&gt;550 digits in under 5 minutes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may think that such prodigious mental feats are linked to having an unusual brain, or to being extraordinarily clever. But they are not. New research published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt; shows that you, too, can be a super memorizer with just six weeks of intensive mnemonic training, and also reveals the long-lasting changes to brain structure and function that occur as a result of such training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2015/apr/24/the-homer-simpson-effect-forgetting-to-remember&quot;&gt;The Homer Simpson effect: forgetting to remember&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2016/mar/18/a-neural-pathway-that-erases-memories&quot;&gt;A neural pathway that erases memories&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2017/mar/08/how-to-become-a-super-memorizer-and-what-it-does-to-your-brain&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A blog post for International Women’s Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Katharina Schiederig, EAF Berlin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been only 100 years that women were allowed to study at universities, e.g. in 1908 in Prussia/Germany. Around the same time, an annual International Women’s Day was introduced on March 8 to commemorate the struggle for women’s rights. A historic event only? The theme for International Women’s Day 2017 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.internationalwomensday.com/BeBold&quot;&gt;#BeBoldForChange&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone is called upon to help forge a better working world — a more gender inclusive world. Does this matter for the Human Brain Project as well?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we look at the numbers, we can say: Yes!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst women were once under-represented at doctoral level, in 2012 they made up 47% of PhD graduates in the EU (EU-28), and between 40% and 60% of PhD graduates in all countries covered by the She Figures (&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.europa.eu/en/she-figures-2015-pbKI0415386/&quot;&gt;EU Commission, 2015&lt;/a&gt;). In 2011, women in the EU accounted for only 33% of researchers. In decision-making positions, the share is lower, and this is also true for the HBP: only two of the 12 Subprojects are led by female researchers, and the Directorate has one woman out of 7 members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why one of the main challenges will be to increase the number of women in higher positions, particularly in governing bodies and in education activities. The HBP aims to play a pioneering role in advancing gender equality by targeting a balanced share of male and female scientists in research teams and decision-making, as well as promoting awareness of gender equality in research and innovation. &lt;strong&gt;This is not only a question of fairness for all; research has also shown that diverse organizations achieve more creative results and attract a more diverse talent pool.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, the HBP will launch an online survey on gender issues among all HBP staff. The results will serve as a baseline to ensure that future policies can be aligned with needs and we can address the barriers identified. Both female and male scientists are invited to share their experiences and recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next two years, foundations will be laid for a comprehensive and sustainable gender strategy for the entire term of the HBP. The HBP is supported in this challenging task by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eaf-berlin.de/&quot;&gt;EAF Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, an independent, non-profit research and consulting organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further activities planned over the next 15 months include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· A good practice study and a database will collect innovative policies and existing measures from the collaborating partners and institutions in order to disseminate good practices and to raise awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· In order to monitor gender equality activities and to transfer them into the entire HBP, a gender advisory committee, linked to the governing structures of the HBP, will be set up. A gender action plan with targets and milestones will be developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Finally, a conference on gender perspectives will take place in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gender equality activities are coordinated by the Project Coordination Office in Geneva. We hope that both HBP researchers and those in the wider scientific community can be inspired by these activities and incorporate them into your personal initiatives around International Women’s Day 2017!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=a78626e135c1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/brain-byte-blog/why-gender-matters-for-the-hbp-a78626e135c1&quot;&gt;Why gender matters for the HBP&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/brain-byte-blog&quot;&gt;Brain Byte Blog&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Feeling authentic in a relationship – that is, feeling like you are able to be yourself, rather than acting out of character – is healthy, not just for the relationship, but for your wellbeing in general. This makes sense: after all, putting on a fake show can be exhausting. But dig a little deeper and things get more complicated because there are different ways to define who “you” really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the real you how you actually think and behave, for instance? Or, taking a more dynamic perspective, is it fairer to say that the true you is the person you aspire to be: what psychologists call your “ideal self”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167216688211&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, Muping Gan and Serena Chen asked members of the public about this and 70 per cent of them thought that the ability to be your actual self was more important for feeling authentic in a relationship than being able to be your ideal self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But contrary to this folk wisdom, across several studies, the researchers actually found evidence for the opposite – that is, feelings of authenticity in a relationship seem to arise not from being our actual selves in the relationship, but from feeling that we can be our best or ideal self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-20357&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers made this discovery across several surveys conducted on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk website, each involving hundreds of participants of varying ages and in a range of different relationships, from the relatively new to decades-long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one survey, participants answered questions about how they acted in their relationship, described what they considered to be their actual self, their ideal self, and they also answered questions about their feelings of authenticity in that relationship (for instance, they rated how much they could “be themselves” when with their partner and how they much they “felt artificial”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that feelings of authenticity in the relationship were higher when the way they behaved in the relationship more closely matched what they considered to be their ideal self. This association stayed true even when factoring out the contribution of other more general relationship factors, like relationship satisfaction and commitment. In contrast, being able to act in the relationship in ways similar to how they’d described their actual self did not correlate with feelings of authenticity in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In further surveys, the researchers asked participants to perform short thought experiments before measuring their feelings of relationship authenticity. For example, in one survey some participants spent time thinking about ways that they are able to act like their ideal selves in their relationship whereas other participants spent time thinking about the ways they act with their partner that are different from their ideal self. In another case, participants spent time thinking about how the way they act with their partner is the same as their actual self, while others thought about how they are unable to act like their actual selves when with their partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcomes of these different thought experiments were clear: thinking about the ability to be one’s ideal self in the relationship increased subsequent feelings of relationship authenticity (and thinking of not be able to be one’s ideal self had the converse effect). Meanwhile, thinking about the ability to be one’s actual self in the relationship did not increase feelings of relationship authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, at least when it comes to feelings of authenticity in a relationship, what seems to matter the most is not that we can be ourselves, as such, but that we can behave as the kind of person we strive to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chimes in an interesting way with another concept in relationship research known as the Michelangelo phenomenon. This is the finding that we tend to make more progress towards our ideal selves when our partner has the same traits that we aspire to have ourselves, through encouragement or acting by example. The name of the concept invokes the idea of our partners helping to reveal our ideal selves, like a sculptor gradually reveals the form of a statue. These new findings suggest that if you have a partner like this, not only will you make more progress toward the kind of person you’d like to be, but that you’ll also have stronger feelings of authenticity in that relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gan and Chen conclude their paper by suggesting that it might be time to revise the authenticity trope in romantic movies, such as when Mac in &lt;em&gt;Juno&lt;/em&gt; says: “Look, in my opinion, the best thing you can do is find a person who loves you for exactly what you are. Good mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty, handsome, what have you…”. Perhaps in the future, the researchers write, “a movie character will dispense advice more along the lines of: “Look, in my opinion, the best thing you can do is find a person who you feel like you are your ‘best you’ with.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;© kbuntu / Fotolia&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Fotolia-Person-holding-a-globe-kbuntu-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.internationalwomensday.com/&quot;&gt;International Women’s Day&lt;/a&gt; is a time where changes which are needed to ensure gender equality are highlighted to increase awareness about the inequities present as well as celebrating the achievements of women who have overcome barriers. One of the action points listed for the #BeBoldForChange, is that which tackles violence against women. Gender based violence is often divided into two categories which are interlinked: Interpersonal and Structural/ Institutional. Broadly speaking, interpersonal violence refers to an act of violence such as physical, psychological and sexual violence perpetrated by an individual (i.e. partner or non-partner) against another. It is estimated that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/&quot;&gt;35% of women worldwide&lt;/a&gt; have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner at some point in their lifetime. It has also been found that globally, around &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/&quot;&gt;38% of women murdered&lt;/a&gt; were at the hands of a male intimate partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8653&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;© Tiko / Fotolia&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8653&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Fotolia-Female-hand-stop-sign-Tiko-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;© Tiko / Fotolia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural/ institutional violence refers to systematic ways in which social structures harm or otherwise puts individuals at a disadvantage. It is the violence of injustice and inequity. These structures are violent because they result in avoidable deaths, illness and injury. By being built into the fabric of society (i.e. political and economic organization of our social world) it &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-015-0256-4&quot;&gt;creates and maintains inequalities&lt;/a&gt; within and between different social groups, and also among ethnic-cultural or other minority groups. Structural violence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21438698&quot;&gt;creates barriers&lt;/a&gt; and prevents people from accessing the resources needed to develop their full human potential and also threatens the achievement of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/&quot;&gt;Millennium Development Goals (MDG)&lt;/a&gt; which are a set of targets for improving the lives of the world’s poorest people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Violence against women is a significant public health issue and a violation of human rights. It can have negative impacts on a woman’s physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health. It has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/85241/1/WHO_RHR_HRP_13.06_eng.pdf?ua=1&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that women who have been physically or sexually abused by their partners are 16% more likely to have a low birth weight baby, more than twice as likely to have an abortion, 1.5 times more prone to acquire HIV, and almost twice as likely to experience depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/SVWomen&quot;&gt;Thematic Series: The Role of Structural and Interpersonal Violence in the Lives of Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8651&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Image by Flickr user Michelle Carl (CC By 2.0)&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8651&quot; height=&quot;199&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Image-by-Flickr-user-Michelle-Carl-CC-By-2.0-300x199.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Image by Flickr user Michelle Carl (CC By 2.0)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a cross-journal thematic series running in &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Women’s Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The aim of the article collection is to build a strong understanding of structural and interpersonal violence against women, to explore its prevalence, incidence and possible risk factors as well as to identify policy responses to address structural inequities that make women vulnerable to various forms of violence. There is a clear need to increase efforts across a range of domains to tackle and prevent violence from taking place and to provide the necessary support and service for those who have fallen victim to these circumstances. Through research, acquisition of data and information, decision making and policy can be informed to address, reduce and ultimately end violence against women. After all, equality and a life free of violence are basic human rights that belong to every person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article collection is currently open for submission. Published papers which form part of the collection can be accessed via its homepage (please &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/SVWomen&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adolescents take more risks than adults: they are more likely to binge drink, have casual sex, commit crimes and have serious car accidents. In fact, adolescence is a paradox because it is a time of peak physical fitness, but also the time when people are most likely to be injured or killed in an accident. For this reason, it’s critical to understand what drives teenagers to take more risks. To date, many explanations of teenage risk taking have focused on the positive side of these behaviours: the rewarding “kick” that comes from taking a risk that ends well. Some studies have shown that teenagers experience more of this rewarding feeling, and this contributes to the increased risk taking seen at this age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer studies have considered how teenagers respond when risks turn out badly. This is important because all our previous experiences, both good and bad, affect our subsequent behaviour. If we make a risky decision like gambling money, and it pays off, it’s more likely we’ll decide to gamble again in the near future. Equally, if we take a gamble and it turns out badly, we’ll probably be a bit more reserved next time. But it turns out that some teenagers don’t respond like this: according to a new study in &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt;, some of them do not adjust their behavior so readily when things go wrong, and this may be linked to a distinct pattern of activation in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-20339&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethan McCormick and Eva Telzer at North Carolina University asked 58 adolescents (aged 13 to 17) to play a game that involved risks. The researchers scanned the participants’ brains while they played, and also monitored how losing the game in one round (taking a risk that didn’t pay off) affected their behaviour in the subsequent round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game involved blowing up 24 virtual balloons shown on a computer screen. Each balloon started small, and the more that participants pumped it up (by pressing a keyboard key), the more points they earned. However, there was a catch: as the balloon got bigger, there was always a chance that it would pop, causing a loud explosion on the screen and losing the participant all the points they had obtained on that round. So the teenagers had to make a series of risky decisions: should they cash out and save the points they had accumulated so far, or risk the balloon popping for the chance of even more points?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, the outcome from one balloon affected the teens’ behaviour on the next one. After an explosion outcome (a risk that turned out badly), they tended to pump fewer times on the subsequent balloon before cashing out. Conversely, when they successfully cashed out the points before the balloon popped, the teens tended to risk more pumps the next time round. Importantly, though, this wasn’t the same for all of them: some of the teenagers continued to pump a lot even after their last balloon had just exploded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCormick and Telzer found that this behaviour was linked to a distinctive pattern of neural activation. Specifically, teens who were less sensitive to past explosions (i.e. less likely to change their behaviour on subsequent rounds) had reduced activity in the medial prefrontal cortex. This part of the brain is involved in decision making processes, like judging how risky we think a decision is, and how good we consider the result. These same teens also said they engaged in more real-life risk-taking, like drinking alcohol or taking drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current findings suggest that – for some teenagers at least – it’s not just about remembering the good times, it’s about forgetting the bad times, too: some teenagers are not using past outcomes to change their current behavior. It’s not clear from the brain activity differences whether this is a conscious decision, or whether this insensitivity to the past is happening outside of the person’s awareness. It’s also important to note that the study focused on teenagers only, and didn’t include a group of children or adults, so we don’t know whether the findings reported here are unique to this age group, or common to big risk-takers of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could we use this information to reduce risk taking in teenagers? Might it be beneficial to encourage those who take risks to consider their past behavior, to remember when things turned out badly, and suggest they use this to guide their behaviour? From the present data, it’s not clear whether this is a skill that could be taught. It’s also important to consider just how much we want to reduce risk taking. Adolescence is a time of potential vulnerability, and we need to educate young people to protect them from harming themselves. But risk taking is not inherently bad. Within limits, taking risks allows us to become independent and to learn about the world around us. It’s a fundamental part of growing up. We need to walk the fine line between encouraging our young people to stay safe, whilst also allowing them to navigate the world for themselves – even when this means taking risks.&lt;/p&gt;

The number of patents implicating specific brain regions has risen from 1976 to the mid 2010s. Results were obtained by searching The Lens patent database (http://lens.org/).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“What is the ethical value of awarding patent rights that implicate regions of the brain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do the applicants intend to patent the function of specific brain areas? This absurd scenario was the first thing that came to mind. The murky waters of neurotech patent law were explored by a group of neuroethics and intellectual property experts (&lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3782&quot;&gt;Roskams-Edriset al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;) who noted several problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;The first practical challenge to patents that relate to brain regions is  well known to patent law: the danger of overbroad, vague, or obvious claims.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One egregious example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/patents/US9327069&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;US 9327069 B2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Methods and systems for treating a medical condition by promoting neural remodeling within the brain&lt;/i&gt;. The language is extremely vague (and redundant):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Methods of treating a medical condition include applying at least one stimulus to a stimulation site within the brain of a patient with an implanted stimulator in accordance with one or more stimulation parameters. The [&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;]  at least one stimulus is configured to promote neural remodeling within the brain of the patient. Systems for treating a medical condition include an implantable stimulator configured to apply at least one stimulus to a stimulation site within the brain of a patient in accordance with one or more stimulation parameters...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What kind of stimulus will “promote neural remodeling?” All of them. As stated in the Detailed Description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;The stimulus may include an electrical stimulation current, one or more drugs, gene infusion, chemical stimulation, thermal stimulation, electromagnetic stimulation, mechanical stimulation, and/or any other suitable stimulus.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What brain conditions can be treated? All of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Many medical conditions have been linked to faulty neural connections and/or abnormal developmental pruning of axons, dendrites, and synapses within the brain. Such medical conditions include, but are not limited to, autism, psychological disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, compulsive behaviors, and depression), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), and chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Down syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, what are the implicated brain regions? You guessed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nearly every brain area has been implicated in the disorders listed above.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In particular, it is believed that faulty neural connections and/or abnormal developmental pruning of neural structures within the temporal lobe, limbic system, pituitary gland, brainstem, cerebral cortex, and/or any other midbrain structure are at least in part responsible for the deficits of one or more of the disorders listed above.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/patents/US9327069&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Claims&lt;/a&gt; that apply in this patent (e.g., stimulation sites and medical conditions) are slightly more specific, but still outlandish:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;4. ... said stimulation site comprises at least one or more of a  temporal lobe, cerebral ventricle, structure within a limbic system,  pituitary gland, brainstem, and cerebral cortex. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. ...said medical condition comprises at least one or more of  autism, a psychological disorder, a neurodegenerative disease, a  chromosomal abnormality, a bad habit, and an injury to said brain.&lt;/blockquote&gt;A bad habit??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;100,000,000 Hz&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better is Patent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/patents/US9050463&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;US 9,050,463&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Systems and methods for stimulating cellular function in tissue&lt;/i&gt;), which touts the application of electrical fields with frequencies of 100,000,000 Hz and above to the entire nervous system...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;....various structures within the brain or nervous system including but not limited to dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, any component of the basal ganglia, nucleus accumbens, gastric nuclei, brainstem, thalamus, inferior colliculus, superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray, primary motor cortex, supplementary motor cortex, occipital lobe, Brodmann areas 1-48, primary sensory cortex, primary visual cortex, primary auditory cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, cochlea, cranial nerves, cerebellum, frontal lobe, occipital lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, sub-cortical structures, spinal cord, nerve roots, sensory organs, and peripheral nerves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ...to treat all known diseases:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Such pathologies that may be treated include but are not limited to Multiple Sclerosis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Alzheimer's Disease, Dystonia, Tics, Spinal Cord Injury, Traumatic Brain Injury, Drug Craving, Food Craving, Alcohol Craving, Nicotine Craving, Stuttering, Tinnitus, Spasticity, Parkinson's Disease, Parkinsonianism, Obsessions, Depression, Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, Acute Mania, Catonia, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Autism, Chronic Pain Syndrome, Phantom Limb Pain, Epilepsy, Stroke, Auditory Hallucinations, Movement Disorders, Neurodegenerative Disorders, Pain Disorders, Metabolic Disorders, Addictive Disorders, Psychiatric Disorders, Traumatic Nerve Injury, and Sensory Disorders. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O-mG68AVIFM/WL09k-_RhGI/AAAAAAAAMEE/iHbki5UyfNAtkNIfTkjO_EYwx2t82KJhQCLcB/s1600/US%2B8594783%2BB..png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;216&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O-mG68AVIFM/WL09k-_RhGI/AAAAAAAAMEE/iHbki5UyfNAtkNIfTkjO_EYwx2t82KJhQCLcB/s320/US%2B8594783%2BB..png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly, the specific &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/patents/US9050463&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Claims&lt;/a&gt; in this patent include an indication limited to Parkinson's disease.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know” Ernest Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of us would like to be smarter and happier, but does one lead to the other? Folk wisdom suggests not: old sayings tell us that “ignorance is bliss” and that “only a fool can be happy”. What does the psychology literature say? A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879117300039&quot;&gt;new meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Vocational Behaviour&lt;/em&gt; has combined the results from dozens of previous studies involving many tens of thousands of participants and, contrary to the received wisdom, it concludes that higher intelligence actually does correlate with greater happiness (or “life satisfaction”) and job satisfaction, but only weakly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-20262&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Gonzalez-Mulé at Indiana University and his colleagues sifted the literature, identifying relevant papers, published and unpublished, going back to 1980. Combining the results from 33 papers involving nearly 50,000 participants, they found that intelligence (or what they called “general mental ability”) had a weak but statistically non-significant positive correlation with life satisfaction, and a modest, statistically significant positive correlation with job satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found further evidence for the apparent benefits of higher intelligence for life satisfaction by factoring in the influence of “job complexity” (greater complexity meaning a job with more variety, skill demands and autonomy) and job income, two factors that are themselves correlated with greater happiness. This showed that higher intelligence has indirect links with greater happiness because more intelligent people tend to earn more, but especially because they tend to have more complex jobs, which presumably are more rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to 38 studies involving nearly 30,000 participants, higher intelligence also had indirect links with job satisfaction by virtue of the fact that it correlated with job complexity and income. But this is psychology, so of course there’s a twist that somewhat supports the folk wisdom about intelligent people rarely being happy. When the researchers held job complexity and income constant in their analysis, they found that higher intelligence actually correlated with less job satisfaction. Put differently, if you imagine a range of people at a given level of job complexity and income, those with higher intelligence will tend to be less happy with their jobs. This makes intuitive sense if you consider that smarter people will be more likely than others to experience boredom and frustration at jobs that are not challenging enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great strength of meta-analyses like this one is in the huge amounts of data that they can draw on. But the new study also has some obvious limitations: some of the data is decades-old and may not be relevant to today’s world. Also, this is cross-sectional data which can’t convincingly address whether intelligence is causing changes in life and job satisfaction, nor how such processes may unfold over time.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 Natural products preserved in the geological record can function as ‘molecular fossils’, providing insight into organisms and physiologies that existed in the deep past. One important group of molecular fossils is the steroidal hydrocarbons (steranes), which are the diagenetic remains of sterol lipids. Complex sterols with modified side chains are unique to eukaryotes, although simpler sterols can also be synthesized by a few bacteria. Sterol biosynthesis is an oxygen-intensive process; thus, the presence of complex steranes in ancient rocks not only signals the presence of eukaryotes, but also aerobic metabolic processes. In 1999, steranes were reported in 2.7 billion year (Gyr)-old rocks from the Pilbara Craton in Australia, suggesting a long delay between photosynthetic oxygen production and its accumulation in the atmosphere (also known as the Great Oxidation Event) 2.45–2.32 Gyr ago. However, the recent reappraisal and rejection of these steranes as contaminants pushes the oldest reported steranes forward to around 1.64 Gyr ago (ref. 6). Here we use a molecular clock approach to improve constraints on the evolution of sterol biosynthesis. We infer that stem eukaryotes shared functionally modern sterol biosynthesis genes with bacteria via horizontal gene transfer. Comparing multiple molecular clock analyses, we find that the maximum marginal probability for the divergence time of bacterial and eukaryal sterol biosynthesis genes is around 2.31 Gyr ago, concurrent with the most recent geochemical evidence for the Great Oxidation Event. Our results therefore indicate that simple sterol biosynthesis existed well before the diversification of living eukaryotes, substantially predating the oldest detected sterane biomarkers (approximately 1.64 Gyr ago), and furthermore, that the evolutionary history of sterol biosynthesis is tied to the first widespread availability of molecular oxygen in the ocean–atmosphere system.

 Elasmobranch fishes, including sharks, rays, and skates, use specialized electrosensory organs called ampullae of Lorenzini to detect extremely small changes in environmental electric fields. Electrosensory cells within these ampullae can discriminate and respond to minute changes in environmental voltage gradients through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that the voltage-gated calcium channel CaV1.3 and the big conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel are preferentially expressed by electrosensory cells in little skate (Leucoraja erinacea) and functionally couple to mediate electrosensory cell membrane voltage oscillations, which are important for the detection of specific, weak electrical signals. Both channels exhibit unique properties compared with their mammalian orthologues that support electrosensory functions: structural adaptations in CaV1.3 mediate a low-voltage threshold for activation, and alterations in BK support specifically tuned voltage oscillations. These findings reveal a molecular basis of electroreception and demonstrate how discrete evolutionary changes in ion channel structure facilitate sensory adaptation.

The first of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Channels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a new way for specialist communities to communicate, find and read research content, launch this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channels provide an innovative way of curating and presenting published research relevant to a scholarly community. Each is curated by a small group of Channel Editors, themselves researchers, who continuously bring together and showcase recently published research content selected from the broad scope of PLOS journals. Importantly, Channel Editors can point to resources, news and commentary from many online sources, including articles published in other journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLOS developed Channels for communities to drive according to their own content priorities, without limitation to any particular journal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With experts at the helm, and content selected by researchers for researchers, we hope to create online venues that become a preferred destination for research communities. To this end, the Channels concept was designed with researchers’ input to adapt to various needs. Channels can be adopted as a resource by researchers in a specialist area, or bring together researchers from different academic backgrounds working towards a common aim. The first three Channels to launch illustrate a variety of applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/vdrrc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;VDRR&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-7396 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;229&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/03/VDRR-1-300x229.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/vdrrc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Veteran Disability &amp;amp; Rehabilitation Research Channel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was born from a collaboration with the US Department of Veterans Affairs Rehabilitation Research and Development Service, as a new home for the community previously served by the Journal of Rehabilitation Research &amp;amp; Development (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rehab.research.va.gov/jrrd/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JRRD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) which ceased publication in 2017. The new Channel, with an expanded international focus, features multidisciplinary research for a global community of researchers and care providers working with veterans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/open-source-toolkit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;OST&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-7400 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;209&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/03/OST-300x209.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/open-source-toolkit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Source Toolkit Channel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showcases research from a diverse group of fields that have in common the description of innovative open source software and hardware applications that can be used in research and education. This Channel aims not to serve a specific scientific discipline but to create bridges between vibrant communities that build tools to support democratization and reproducibility of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Tuberculosis Channel&lt;/strong&gt;, led by Academic Editors from &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, will launch on World TB Day, March 24th, 2017. This Channel will draw from PLOS journal content covering all aspects of TB from mycobacteriology to computational epidemiologic models, clinical diagnosis and treatment. By integrating these reports with content from a variety of external sources, Channel Editors aim to provide an accessible resource of interest to TB researchers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are grateful to the Channel Editors who have stepped up enthusiastically to pioneer the use of this new tool for their communities. More PLOS Channels will follow later this year—some are already in preparation. If you have interest in becoming a Channel Editor or see an unmet need in your community for this tool, we welcome your thoughts. We look forward to working with many more communities to help disseminate their work, create useful resources and foster collaboration within and across specialist communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 What happens in the brain when we die?



Canadian researchers Loretta Norton and colleagues of the University of Western Ontario examine this grave question in a new paper: Electroencephalographic Recordings During Withdrawal of Life-Sustaining Therapy Until 30 Minutes After Declaration of Death

Norton et al. examined frontal EEG recordings from four critically ill patients at the point where their life support was withdrawn. Here are some details on the four:

&lt;p&gt;Sweet, old-fashioned circle time rituals involve young children sitting in a circle with a teacher and copying his or her specific actions as closely as possible. These rituals can seem a bit out of place in today’s culture with its emphasis on the importance of independent thinking, and the ubiquity of interactive educational games employing the latest beeps and whistles of technology. But a &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/cdev.12762/abstract&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Child Development&lt;/em&gt; says there is something about the conformity and attention to detail in ritualistic games that makes them a highly effective way to improve children’s executive functioning (their mental nimbleness) and self-control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-20174&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veronica Rybanska at the University of Oxford and her colleagues tested two groups of 7- and 8-year-old children, one from Slovakia, the other from Vanuatu in the Southwest Pacific. The children first completed tests of their executive functioning and self control. The executive functioning test involved learning to respond accurately to reversed commands, such as touching toes when hearing the command “touch your knees”. The self control test was a version of Walter Mischel’s classic Marshmallow Test: if the children could resist eating a single piece of chocolate for 15 minutes, they could have three afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, for three months, some of the children undertook 35-minutes of circle time games twice per week (others acted as controls and didn’t perform these games). The games involved things like dancing, clapping or learning new traffic light rules, such as stopping for purple rather than red. Crucially, among the children who played the circle time games, half experienced them as rituals. They were told they must follow the actions of the game because “it has always been done this way” or “those are the rules and they must be followed”. The others experienced the games in a more “instrumental” way that emphasised the purpose of the games. For example, they were told “if we do it this way, we will learn how to dance”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the three month period, the children took the tests of executive function and self-control again. The children who’d completed the circle time games showed greater improvements in their executive function and self-control than the control group children, but crucially these gains were larger in the children who experienced the circle time games as ritual. Moreover, the superior improvements in self-control in the ritual group seemed to be explained by their greater increase in executive functioning ability. These effects were similar in Slovakia and Vanuatu even though the latter culture places a greater emphasis on rituals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Far from being a simple matter of ‘mindless’ copying, ritual participation arguably requires the kind of rigorous computation of arbitrary detail and avoidance of normatively proscribed deviation from the script that engages and exercises our executive functioning abilities,” the researchers said. They admitted to the limitations of their study: for one thing, they didn’t measure the children’s behavior during circle time, so it’s not certain the ritual group children really did pay closer attention to the games. Nonetheless, they said there could be educational implications to their results: “the irony may be that in devising strategies for parenting and schooling geared to a world of rapid technological change while neglecting the importance of traditional cultural practices, we may be contributing to a deterioration of young people’s attentive and inhibitive resources, thus promoting impulses toward instant gratification”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/cdev.12762/abstract&quot;&gt;Rituals Improve Children’s Ability to Delay Gratification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;BMCWordle&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/07/BMCWordle-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetics: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenet.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12863-017-0477-7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systematically producing color-blind fish&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color perception is essential for the survival and reproduction of many animals. This study, published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Genetics&lt;/em&gt;, demonstrates the development of a systematic procedure, using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, for making color blind Japanese rice fish and testing their spectral sensitivity under light- and dark-adapted conditions. This fish model system can prove useful for studying visual systems and vision-dependent behaviour and can potentially be extended to study color perception in other non-mammalian vertebrates. Finally, it could be valuable for the advancement of genetic or regenerative methods to treat human color blindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Health: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4081-6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing diabetes risk with weight management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weight reduction for individuals at high-risk of diabetes is a key measure and policy paradigm for the prevention of the disease. This observational cohort study by Feldman et al., represents a 10-year follow-up in a group of more than 33,000 Swedish  participants between the ages of 30-60. It demonstrates a strong association between the risk of incident diabetes and the relative weight of the participant in adulthood. Additionally, the authors show that as many as 1 in 5 diabetes cases could be prevented if, at a population level, weight in adulthood is maintained. Finally, it concludes that the combination of the former approach together with moderate weight loss for high-risk individuals would have great potential, from a public health perspective, in diabetes prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often the first line of treatment for depression. The objective of this study, published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, is to conduct a systematic review assessing the effects of SSRIs versus placebo, ‘active’ placebo, or no intervention in adult participants with major depressive disorder. Meta-analysis data indicate that SSRIs versus placebo seem to have statistically significant effects on depressive symptoms, but according to the authors, the clinical significance of these effects seems questionable and all trials were at high risk of bias. The results show that the harmful effects of SSRIs versus placebo for major depressive disorder seem to outweigh any potentially small beneficial effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nematode genus &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis&lt;/em&gt; has been integral to our understanding of metazoan biology and has provided key insights into molecular and developmental biology.  In this study, published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Zoology&lt;/em&gt;, Slos et al. use both morphological and molecular analyses to characterise and describe a new species, &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis monodelphis&lt;/em&gt;. Scanning electron micrographs of &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;monodelphis&lt;/em&gt; are utilised to showcase morphological differences between males and females, focusing mainly on genital differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developmental plasticity, which is considered to have profound macro-evolutionary effects, is omnipresent among plants and animals. This study by van Bergen et al. investigates, using a comparative framework, the evolution of reaction norms for a variety of life history and morphological traits across five related species of mycalesine butterflies from the Old World tropics. It demonstrates that the integrated phenotypic plasticity of a broad suite of traits is shared among species from three geographically independent lineages of mycalesine butterflies, but concurrently, there are examples of evolutionary change where independent traits show different, ‘uncoupled’ patterns of reaction norm evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infectious Diseases: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2255-6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewing the UK management of HIV in pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential for HIV transmission between a pregnant woman and her unborn child was first recognised in 1982. The prevention, however, of mother to child transmission (MTCT) is still very complex: interventions aim to reduce risk throughout pregnancy, labour, delivery and the neonatal period. Since 2001, the British HIV Association (BHIVA) has produced guidelines to support clinicians in the delivery of care aimed at reducing MTCT. This audit reviews the UK management of HIV in pregnancy, in comparison with the 2012 BHIVA guidelines. Having investigated more than 1400 pregnancies, the study demonstrates a need for services to review their ability to access urgent HIV testing, to strengthen referral pathways between general and specialist antenatal care services and to identify where delays in starting women on antiretroviral therapy are occurring. Finally, local policy should be kept up to date with national guidance to ensure women are able to access the best possible care available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecology: &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-017-0119-y&quot;&gt;Do predator cues affect trait variability in marine dinoflagellates?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phenotypic plasticity is commonplace and enables organisms to respond to environmental variations. However, the ability of various genotypes to produce a common, environmentally cued phenotype may differ due to genetic variation between individuals .This study, in &lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/em&gt;, analysed the plastic response of two genotypes of the marine dinoflagellate &lt;em&gt;Alexandrium fundyense&lt;/em&gt;, in response to grazers or grazer cues, in order to characterise their effect on trait variability. The study demonstrated that selection on different genotypes can occur in the presence of plasticity due to different costs and trade-offs that arise for the respective genotype. The occurrence of multiple environmental cues to respond to in nature might, in fact, equalise the effects of strain-specific trade-offs within populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Research Notes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has reaffirmed its focus on publishing research outputs which are useful but often overlooked by traditional research journals such as updates to previous work, additions to established methods, single observations, short null results research proposals and data management plans. To increase clarity and simplicity, we have reduced the number of article types and created ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/research-note&quot;&gt;Research note&lt;/a&gt;’, the journal’s main article format with a word limit of 2,000 making it a true note article structured as introduction, main text and limitations. Finally, we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biomedcentral.com/p/introducing-the-new-bmc-research-notes&quot;&gt;expanded the scope&lt;/a&gt; to also welcome submissions on physical and computer sciences, engineering and mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;space invaders brains&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/03/space-invaders-brains-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Elena Blanco-Suárez&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most common metaphors in neuroscience is that the brain is like a computer. Yet this comparison fails to illustrate how complex our brains are. The brain, like a computer, receives information and analyzes it. However, there are substantial differences in the way a computer or a brain manages information as well as how and from where it receives the inputs, among many other reasons that render the analogy inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Jonas from UC Berkeley and Konrad Kording from Northwestern University in Chicago took this metaphor a step further in an amusing – though slightly disheartening – &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article in PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/a&gt;, alluringly titled &lt;em&gt;Could a neuroscientist understand a microprocessor?&lt;/em&gt; Their intention was to confront the possibility that current neuroscience techniques might not be the best to decipher the workings of the brain. To do this they analyzed a microprocessor as if it were a brain. They collected data using standard neuroscience tools to see whether they could infer the way the machine processes information, just like neuroscientists analyze large datasets to untangle brain mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They used three video games, well known to all the 80’s kids reading: Donkey Kong, Space Invaders and Pitfall. Each of these video games represented a different behavioral output from the microprocessor. For the biological equivalent, think of a &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; (the microprocessor) and different behavioral phenotypes (the three video games). Although they acknowledge the limitations of comparing a microprocessor to a living organism’s brain, the authors argue that there are enough similarities to justify the study: both a brain and a microprocessor consist of interconnections of smaller units that can be differentiated and studied individually. They compare the build of the microprocessor to that of a brain, where we find circuits, subdivided into microcircuits, comprised of neurons that make connections through their synapses. Of course, the microprocessor is simpler than a brain in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using neuroscience protocols to study a microprocessor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They used established protocols to analyze diverse features of the microprocessor MOS6502, a model that is very well understood. Using the approach presented in &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/content/4/e04250&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one of their previous papers&lt;/a&gt;, they were able to identify types of transistors within the microprocessor and the connections between them, similar to the study of connectomics in the brain. In the microprocessor they only found one type of transistor, making it far simpler than a brain. However, it was impossible to infer the operation of the microprocessor by just looking at the connectomics. In neuroscience this is even more complicated, since type of cell, synapses, channels and neurotransmitters have to be integrated into the whole picture. The authors stated the importance of the study of connectomics, but emphasized the lack of algorithms to determine the functions of the brain regions assessed, hence the difficulty of understanding the brain through the sole analysis of connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also studied the effect of game performance when they removed one or more transistors from the microprocessor. This is similar to what we do in the lab, when a gene is knocked out to study the effects. They identified the contribution of each transistor to each video game considered, but they could not generalize to the rest of the games without further analysis. According to the authors, these results relate to neuroscience in that it is unlikely that a certain behavior would be triggered without the interaction of different brain circuits/regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the paper, they looked into other aspects of the transistors: tuning, correlations, local field potentials, functional connectivity, spatio-temporal activity, and how they differed depending on the game that was being played. With every set of experiments they concluded that, although interesting and necessary data were drawn, no individual dataset provided a full understanding of how the MOS6502 processes information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better approaches for better conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has to be taken into account that this study of the microprocessor is a lot cleaner than actual neuroscience. We cannot forget brain plasticity and the capability of the brain to repair circuits or compensate for lesions and other impairments. MOS6502 cannot compensate for what the researchers were doing to it, rendering the data much cleaner and clearer than that from neuroscience experiments &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found their data unsatisfactory&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;as it did not lead to conclusions that accurately explained the function and structure of the microprocessor as they know it. If they had made assumptions about the microprocessor based in the results herein, these might have been erroneous or misleading. This is why they advise caution at interpreting small data sets. The authors insist that better experiments would have helped them to understand the microprocessor. However, what we can learn from this interesting publication is that, although neuroscience is nowadays producing valuable data to understand how our brain is connected, we still fall short of integrating this information at the high level of complexity of the living organism. And per their suggestion, neuroscience might need a better neuroinformatics approach as well as more refined methods for analyzing data to reach reliable and truthful conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, can neuroscientists really understand a microprocessor? Jonas and Kording believe we just need different methods to do so, and that testing these methods in a microprocessor could provide certain validation. But perhaps this study should not be considered as confirmation or rebuttal of the value of neuroscience to understand microprocessors, or even as measurement of the worth of current neuroscientific methods. This study offers additional evidence that brains are not computers. We definitely need a better metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Columbia University have retracted a 2013 paper in The Journal of Clinical Investigation, after uncovering abnormalities in the stem cell lines that undermined the conclusions in the paper. Last year, corresponding author Dieter Egli discovered he could not reproduce key data in the 2013 paper because almost all the cell lines first author Haiqing Hua used […]&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Credit: Rocky Mountain Laboratories,NIAID,NIH Color-enhanced scanning electron micrograph showing Salmonella typhimurium (red) invading cultured human cells.&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/SalmonellaNIAID-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;As if climate change, international terrorism, rising mental ill-health, teenage knife crime, post-Brexit instability and potential superpower tensions were not enough to worry the heck out of us parents, the real spectre of a post-antibiotic era looms. Will my children live as long as I? Will I live as long as my parents or die a lingering death from an untreatable infection picked up in a nursing home which functioned as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance?  In 2013 England’s Chief Medical Officer considered the rise in antimicrobial resistance “a national civil emergency”(1). In May 2016, the O’Neill “Review on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)”(2)&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt; sponsored by Welcome Trust and the English Department of Health, produced a plan for  tackling drug-resistance globally  exactly one year after the 68&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; World Health Assembly endorsed the WHO’s global action plan for AMR(3). Both plans highlighted “strengthening of knowledge through research”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of us with enough miles on our biological clocks, this sounds very familiar. 1998 seemed to be a year signaling a paradigm shift in health priorities with the publication of reports like “The Path of Least Resistance”&lt;sup&gt;4 &lt;/sup&gt;and the European Union’s urgent convocation of the Copenhagen Summit on &lt;sup&gt;“&lt;/sup&gt;The Microbial Threat”&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. Both highlighted the need for better research to develop a robust evidence base to inform practice and policy. Twenty years on we appear to stand at the edge of the abyss. Yet it would not be fair to say that in the interim there has been no change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8644&quot; style=&quot;width: 289px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_culture&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8644 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;185&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_culture-300x199.jpg&quot; width=&quot;279&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Sun14916/Wikipedia Pseudomonas_aeruginosa&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;True, much of what we knew then has remained the same. Hands still need to be cleaned, antibiotics prescribed less, narrow spectrum antibiotics preferred, and screening for resistance performed in those patients most likely to suffer severe infection. However we have not advanced much in understanding how to routinely embed these behaviours in clinical practice. Vaccine development has been less promising than hoped. New antibiotic development remains underfunded and unproductive. Despite this, there has been some better research in both the USA and Europe which has included well designed randomized controlled trials(6-8). The UK experience  of extra funding for national high-profile political drives  to reduce selected infections through evidence-based policies has been encouraging, with improved hand hygiene(9), less broad-spectrum antibiotic use&lt;sup&gt;10,11&lt;/sup&gt; and lower infection rates(9-11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;So what has all this got to do with &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?  Well-designed clinical trials and observational studies inform clinicians and policy makers which interventions work, mainly through published research. However, editors of general medical journals are clear that much published research suffers from poor reporting and methodological flaws which could be avoided through adherence to expert consensus-derived reporting guidelines(12). It is against this background that I welcome &lt;em&gt;BMC Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;’ response to an initiative launched by 18 European and American infection control specialists and academics asking infection control journals to endorse those guidelines most relevant to controlling antimicrobial resistance:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.consort-statement.org/&quot;&gt;CONSORT&lt;/a&gt; for randomized control trials, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strobe-statement.org/index.php?id=strobe-home&quot;&gt;STROBE&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strobe-statement.org/index.php?id=strobe-singel-news-view&amp;amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1357&amp;amp;cHash=52334cb1c3299d67f6703e13a566035d&quot;&gt;STROME-ID&lt;/a&gt;) for observational epidemiological studies including molecular studies, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prisma-statement.org/&quot;&gt;PRISMA&lt;/a&gt; for systematic reviews and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idrn.org/orion.php&quot;&gt;ORION&lt;/a&gt; for infection control intervention studies (especially interrupted time series) and outbreak reports of nosocomial infection. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BioMed Central&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies#standards+of+reporting&quot;&gt;editorial policies and standards of reporting&lt;/a&gt; endorse CONSORT, STROBE and PRISMA and all guidelines hosted by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.equator-network.org/&quot;&gt;EQUATOR Network&lt;/a&gt;, including ORION. However &lt;em&gt;BMC Infectious Disease&lt;/em&gt; has now specifically highlighted ORION in its &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/research-article&quot;&gt;instructions to authors&lt;/a&gt;. My experience of reporting guidelines is that they and their checklists, not only help me review papers but also help me design and report research, if only to anticipate and avoid adverse comment from potential reviewers or grant assessment panels. Indeed, two or more guidelines may be required to cover all aspects of complicated studies. Most infection control journals have endorsed the above guidelines, although the effect of so doing on raising the quality of published research may depend on the rigor which guideline compliance is enforced, a hypothesis worth testing in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, as I enter the last years of my research career, and consider making down-payments on my future nursing home place, I like to think this initiative will result in the high quality research we need being planned and published. If allied to adequate funding of both the research and the clinical implementation of its findings, then maybe my children (and I) might survive antimicrobial resistance.  If climate change and all the rest let us live that long!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK we’re familiar with the practical implications of increasing population density: traffic jams, longer waits to see a doctor, a lack of available housing. What many of us probably hadn’t realised is how living in crowded environment could be affecting us at a deep psychological level, fostering in us a more future-oriented mindset or what evolutionary psychologists call a “slow life history” strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-00749-001/&quot;&gt;their paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, Oliver Sng at the University of Michigan and his colleagues present a range of evidence that shows how this strategy plays out in the more patient ways that we approach our relationships, parenting and economic decisions. In essence, the researchers are proposing that the presence of greater numbers of other people in close proximity prompts us to invest in the future as way to compete more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-20086&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind life history theory comes from observing variations in behaviour between and across species, mainly in terms of how they approach reproduction. Species with longer life-spans that live in greater population densities tend to favour more investment in fewer offspring who take more time to develop. In contrast, species living in lower densities and at great risk of predators tend to favour a short-term strategy, for example having as many offspring as early as possible in the hope that at least some will survive. There’s also evidence that the same species, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3892362/&quot;&gt;such as Chinook salmon&lt;/a&gt;, adjust their mating strategies to the short- or long-term depending on the kind of environment they’re in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test how this might play out with humans, Oliver Sng and his team began by comparing the population densities of countries around the world with a range of parenting and relationship-related outcomes. They found that people in more densely populated countries tend to plan more for the future, have fewer children, have them later, invest in more long-term relationships, and place a greater emphasis on education (this pattern held even after accounting for between-country differences in urbanisation, economic development and population size ). The same pattern also applied across US states: those with greater population density expressed a more future-oriented focus, a “quality over quantity” approach in terms of relationships and child-rearing, and placed more importance on education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are problems with how to interpret this kind of correlational data (for instance, there could be unknown factors involved) so the researchers also conducted some experiments. They found that asking participants to read an apparent &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; story about increasing population density in the US led them to favour future financial rewards over more immediate gains in a simple economic game. Listening to the soundtrack of a large human crowd, as opposed to white noise, had a similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also showed that the effects of population density reminders seem to be specific to our stage of life. When undergrad students read the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article about America’s increasing crowding, as opposed to an article about rising squirrel populations, they tended to say they favoured investing more in fewer relationships, but their answers about how many children they wanted, or how much they prioritised education, were unaffected. In contrast, reading about increasing population density led an older group of participants (average age 30) to say they favoured investing more time and effort in having fewer children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sng and his colleagues said their results are preliminary: we need more data to confirm these effects and also to explore the potential mechanisms behind them. They believe many mechanisms are likely at play, including population density affecting our hormones and brain development, our motivations (for example, leading us to realise that we need to increase our chances of competing successfully in future), and cultural norms, for example mores around sex and relationships. “Much remains to be examined,” they concluded. “We hope this initial foray will generate renewed interest in a topic that has been all but forgotten, and encourage the field of research on density to become a little more crowded.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;While feeding on watermint, the green mint leaf beetle metabolizes the plant terpenoids, which are biotransformed and eventually excreted with the frass.&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/pic-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plant-insect interaction and co-adaptation: a question of chemical cross-talk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long course of evolution, plants have evolved a wide range of defense mechanisms against insect herbivores, which can be distinguished into two categories: constitutive defenses and inducible defenses. The former ones are physical and chemical barriers existing before insect attack; the latter ones are direct and indirect defenses that are triggered by the insect attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, direct defenses are plant traits able to directly interfere with attacking insects, whereas indirect defenses comprise plant traits that do not affect the susceptibility of host plants by themselves, but can serve as attractants to natural enemies of attacking insects. The response of insects to plant defenses includes the selective choice of different feeding sites, the alteration of the feeding rate or the induction of detoxifying enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long course of evolution, plants have evolved a wide range of defense mechanisms against insect herbivores, which can be distinguished into two categories: constitutive defenses and inducible defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants that accumulate specialized metabolites like the aromatic plant &lt;em&gt;Mentha aquatica &lt;/em&gt;(the watermint) deter herbivory with a direct defense mechanism, by producing terpenoids in glandular trichomes, which are specialized secretory tissues. Despite the toxic content of such secretory structures, specialized herbivores not only feed on plants bearing these structures, but have also evolved the ability to recognize and be attracted by specific compounds. Therefore, interactions between plants and insects occasionally lead to highly specific relationships, as in the case of &lt;em&gt;M. aquatica&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Chrysolina herbacea &lt;/em&gt;(the mint leaf beetle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The very special relationship between &lt;em&gt;Chrysolina herbacea &lt;/em&gt;and the watermint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8614&quot; style=&quot;width: 255px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Mint leaf beetles&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8614 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Mint-leaf-beetles-245x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;245&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrysolina herbacea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emission of volatile compounds from the glandular trichomes of &lt;em&gt;M. aquatica&lt;/em&gt; is mainly characterized by the monoterpene pulegone. This is a potent attractant to &lt;em&gt;C. herbacea, &lt;/em&gt;as shown by olfactometry bioassays. The plant response to &lt;em&gt;C. herbacea&lt;/em&gt; herbivory is the activation of genes for terpenoid biosynthesis, diverting most of monoterpene production from pulegone to menthofuran. The latter compound repels &lt;em&gt;C. herbacea &lt;/em&gt;in bioassay tests. Thus, &lt;em&gt;C. herbacea &lt;/em&gt;is attracted by pulegone produced by undamaged &lt;em&gt;M. aquatica&lt;/em&gt;, but is deterred by the methofuran production by herbivore-infested &lt;em&gt;M. aquatica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results indicate a differential tolerance of &lt;em&gt;C. herbacea&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;M. aquatica&lt;/em&gt; monoterpenes; however, the detoxifying mechanisms and the catabolic/biotransforming ability that allow the insects to tolerate a high amount of ingested terpenoids remained an open question that has only now found some compelling answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How microorganisms can be involved in plant-insect co-adaptation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is recent evidence that microorganisms living in the insect intestinal tract might be involved in biotransformation of ingested leaf volatile terpenoids by activating catabolic and metabolic processes that are absent in insects, hence acting as “microbial brokers”, a strategy that enables phytophagous insects hosting such bacteria to overcome biochemical barriers to herbivory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently described examples are the detoxification of caffeine by gut microbes of the coffee berry borer, and the ability of bark beetles bacterial symbionts to metabolize toxic monoterpenes and diterpene acids produced by the mountain pine beetle in response to herbivore damage. Thus, microbial degradation of plant toxic compounds can occur in insect guts and contribute to the carbon and energy requirements for the host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is recent evidence that microorganisms living in the insect intestinal tract might be involved in biotransformation of ingested leaf volatile terpenoids by activating catabolic and metabolic processes that are absent in insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interestingly, it has been proposed that microbial detoxification may lead to production of pheromonal markers. For instance, some insects feeding on plants that, like &lt;em&gt;M. aquatica&lt;/em&gt;, store 1,8-cineole (a monoterpene with mosquito feeding deterrent and ovipositional repellent activities, and toxic effects against stored-grain beetles) show a marked ability to metabolize it into hydroxyl derivatives that several insects might use as pheromones. This hypothesis extends the possible role of the microorganisms living in the insect intestinal tract, which could be involved in the biosynthesis of semiochemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we find in the watermint-mint bug interaction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our study we first evaluated the chemical patterns of both &lt;em&gt;M. aquatica&lt;/em&gt; leaf and frass (insect faeces) volatiles extracted by &lt;em&gt;C. herbacea&lt;/em&gt; males and females feeding on plants. Intriguingly, we observed marked differences between male and female volatiles. The sex-specific chemical pattern of the frass correlated with sex-specific distribution of cultivable gut bacteria. Indeed, all isolated gut bacteria from females belonged to either α- or γ-Proteobacteria, whilst those from males were γ-Proteobacteria or Firmicutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments we then demonstrated that the microbial communities from the two sexes were associated to specific metabolic patterns with respect to their ability to biotransform and/or detoxify &lt;em&gt;M. aquatica&lt;/em&gt; terpenoids (including methofuran, menthone, 1,8-cineole, limonene and pulegone), and metabolize them into an array of compounds with possible pheromone activity. Thus, the gut bacteria of the mint leaf beetle influence the volatile blend of herbivory-induced &lt;em&gt;M. aquatica&lt;/em&gt; volatiles in a sex-specific way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that our study may contribute to our current understanding about the plant-insect chemical communication, providing a new perspective on exploitation of bacteria living in insect gut as producers of semiochemicals for sustainable agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Mohanraj Durairaj, cc Flickr&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/27343753793_20a9ed25c0_o-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The birth prevalence of mitochondrial disease is approximately 1 in 5000, however 1 in 500 carry mutations in their mitochondrial genome. As there is no cure for mitochondrial disease, the immense variability in genetic defects and disease severity has made effective disease management challenging. Therefore prevention of genetic disease transmission from mother to a child using mitochondrial replacement therapy holds significant promise. Mitochondrial replacement therapy involves combining the nuclear DNA from the mother with healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. This technique was originally developed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/102/46/16765.full&quot;&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt;, validated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7262/full/nature08368.html&quot;&gt;primates&lt;/a&gt;, and recently the birth of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2107219-exclusive-worlds-first-baby-born-with-new-3-parent-technique/&quot;&gt;first ‘three person’ baby&lt;/a&gt; was reported in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, evolutionary biologists have raised concerns about the safety of mitochondrial replacement which are largely centered on the idea that nuclear and mitochondrial genomes evolved concurrently, and therefore mitochondria from one individual or population may not be compatible with nuclear material from another. Indeed as human populations have migrated and become distinct, as have the distribution of mitochondrial &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;gene groups inherited from the mother (mitochondrial &lt;/span&gt;haplotypes). This is illustrated in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3539-3&quot;&gt;figure from the article&lt;/a&gt; (below), which shows the global distribution of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups and highlights the immense variability and how different populations are dominated by distinct regional haplotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8626&quot; style=&quot;width: 979px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Adapted from Rishishwar and Jordan 2017: Map indicating the names and locations of the 1000 genome populations studied, together with pie charts showing the relative frequencies of distinct mtDNA haplogroups for each population. &quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8626&quot; height=&quot;439&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/mtnDNA-blog-image.gif&quot; width=&quot;969&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 2A from &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3539-3&quot;&gt;Rishishwar and Jordan 2017&lt;/a&gt;: Map indicating the names and locations of the 1000 genome populations studied, together with pie charts showing the relative frequencies of distinct mtDNA haplogroups for each population.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deleterious implications of incompatibility and nuclear-mitochondrial mismatch have been indicated by studies in model organism such as mice and invertebrates. For example, although mice with mismatched mitochondrial and nuclear genomes survived into adulthood they showed reduced physical performance, learning and growth. However, as these animals are generated by repeated inbreeding, divergent mitochondria are introduced into highly inbreed lines, and therefore these model organism studies do not reflect the human condition where breeding between populations is common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3539-3&quot;&gt;recently published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;BMC Genomics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;therefore aimed to gain an idea of the extent of nuclear-mitochondrial divergence that can be tolerated in a single individual and gain an idea of how often ‘swapping’ has occurred in human evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internationalgenome.org/&quot;&gt;1000 Genomes Project&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cephb.fr/hgdp/&quot;&gt;Human Genome Diversity Project,&lt;/a&gt; the researchers were able to observe and quantify the extent of naturally occurring nuclear-mitochondrial mismatch seen in 3,547 healthy individuals across over 58 populations on 5 continents. As human genomic diversity has been shaped by natural selection, harmful combinations of nuclear-mitochondrial genomes should have been eliminated and therefore not observed in the existing healthy population sampled in this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis showed that generally the genetic distance between nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mtDNA sequences, which is reflective of evolutionary relationships and migration, were highly correlated. This is what would be expected based on their co-evolution in different human populations. However, analysis also showed that even individuals with very similar nDNA genomes can have highly divergent mtDNA. For example, in Puerto Rico 67% of the sampled population have mtDNA of Native American origin and 13% carry mtDNA haplotypes of European origin. In contrast, analysis of nDNA in the same population showed the reverse with 72% European ancestry and only 13% Native American ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings demonstrated that mitochondrial and nuclear genomes from divergent populations can coexist in healthy individuals, indicating that mismatched nDNA/mtDNA combinations are not deleterious or subjected to purifying selection. This holds great significance for the future prospects of this technique as it suggests nuclear-mitochondrial mismatches are not likely to jeopardize the or safety of mitochondrial replacement therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-1038 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;215&quot; src=&quot;http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/download.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;235&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If you have ever felt reluctant to outsource projects to a service provider because you are worried about sharing proprietary information, you should know that Science Exchange’s mission is to help assuage those concerns. Our dedicated Legal and Engineering teams obtain all of the certifications and meet all the regulatory requirements that your businesses require. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOC 2 Certification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Recently, Science Exchange was granted &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssae-16.com/soc-2/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;SOC 2 certification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; (Service Organization Control 2, Type 2), a strenuous t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;est and report on the effectiveness of a service organization’s controls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. This meant that external auditors reviewed many of the critical processes in our business to make sure our systems complied with five key principles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Principles of SOC 2 compliance:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Security: Access to our system requires authorization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Availability: Our system operates as we have committed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Processing integrity: Processing occurs completely, on time, accurately, and when authorized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Confidentiality: Information designated as “confidential” is specifically protected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;You can read more details on these principles and their implementation on the official &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssae-16.com/soc-2/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;SOC 2 page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does SOC 2 certification mean for Science Exchange users?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Any information shared through the Science Exchange website or via email to a scienceexchange.com address is kept completely confidential.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Examples of information we keep confidential:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Proposed experiments and collaborations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Information on proprietary (i.e., unpublished) materials and methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Experimental results/data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Personal identifying information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Financial information and payment details&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Of course, SOC 2 Type 2 certification is an ongoing process. We will be audited again and again to make sure that your contractual agreements executed with Science Exchange, as well as any revisions to it, remain confidential. We will periodically test our systems for vulnerability and unauthorized access, and we will regularly back up data, keeping backup logs readily available. These are just a few examples of the tireless work we do to minimize the risk inherent in outsourced R&amp;amp;D, helping you advance their research faster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Visit and bookmark our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/compliance&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Compliance page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; to stay abreast of Science Exchange’s ongoing commitment to your security.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://romainbrette.fr/free-the-journals/"/>

		<updated>2017-03-01T13:41:20+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="fr-FR">
 &lt;p&gt;These days, academic journals serve two purposes: to organize peer review, and to make an editorial selection. With internet and in particular “preprint” servers (eg &lt;a href=&quot;http://biorxiv.org/&quot;&gt;biorxiv&lt;/a&gt;), journals are no longer necessary for distributing academic papers. It is also worth reminding that the peer review system has not always been organized in the way it is currently organized, ie with several external reviewers, multiple revision rounds, etc. For example, Nature only introduced formal peer review in 1967. Before that, the selection would be done internally by the editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two missions, organizing peer review and making an editorial selection, are currently coupled. But this is neither necessary, nor a good thing. It is obvious that this coupling is not necessary. One could easily imagine a system where papers are submitted to a mega-journal (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/&quot;&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://peerj.com/&quot;&gt;PeerJ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://f1000research.com/&quot;&gt;F1000 Research&lt;/a&gt;), which organizes the peer review, and then journals (e.g. Nature or Cell) make their editorial selection based on perceived “impact”, possibly using the reviews. Instead, authors must submit to each journal separately until their paper is accepted, and reviewers are asked both to check the scientific standards, which is the alleged purpose of peer review, and to judge the perceived importance of papers, which is an editorial task. This results in frustration for the authors, unnecessary delays and tremendous waste of resources. Thus, it is not a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a peer review system is organized (eg by mega-journals), the remaining role of journals is then editorial selection, and this could be done separately. Once we realize that, it becomes clear that very little infrastructure should be needed to run a journal. A journal issue is then just a list of papers selected by an editor, put online with the appropriate links and editorial comments. I propose that every scientist, or lab, or possibly group of interest, starts their own journal, which I will call “&lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.romainbrette.fr/about-this-free-journal/&quot;&gt;free journal&lt;/a&gt;” (see my related posts &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/a-vision-of-the-post-journal-world/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/my-new-year-resolution-to-help-move-science-to-the-post-journal-world/&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;). Free journals are not tied to any commercial interest; they are self-managed academic journals. Crucially, the editor makes a personal selection based on her readings, papers that she personally thinks are interesting. This means in particular that, in contrast with most journals, the editor is highly qualified. The selection is meaningful, not a collection of thumbs up/down made by disparate reviewers based on vague criteria (“impact”). It also implies that it is totally acceptable for the editorial selection to include “preprints”: the editor is a peer and therefore any featured paper is by definition peer reviewed (ie, as in Nature before 1967). I have made my own &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.romainbrette.fr/&quot;&gt;free journal of theoretical neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; in this spirit. I have collected &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.romainbrette.fr/how-to-make-a-free-journal/&quot;&gt;some technical advice &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.romainbrette.fr/how-to-make-a-free-journal/&quot;&gt;on how to make one&lt;/a&gt;, and I would be happy to receive any suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottomline is: it is very easy to make a free journal. On the technical side, one essentially needs to use a blogging system, eg WordPress. This automatically generates an RSS feed (eg one post per issue). I also put all the comments associated to the selected papers on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/&quot;&gt;PubPeer&lt;/a&gt;, with a link to the journal; this way, anyone using their plugin automatically sees that the papers have been selected in the journal when looking at them on pubmed, for example. On the editorial side, it actually represents little work, and I believe that this little amount is actually quite interesting work to do. Every scientist reads and annotates papers. All that is required to run a free journal then, is to set half a day in the month to put your notes together into a post. This helps organizing your bibliographical notes, and it is helpful for your colleagues and your students. One could also imagine coupling this writing with the lab’s journal club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please leave me a note if you are making your own free journal and I would be happy to link it from my journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My free journal: &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.romainbrette.fr/&quot;&gt;Brette’s &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.romainbrette.fr/&quot;&gt;free journal of theoretical neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;2016's overall winner by Davide Gaglio, the striking landscape of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park during sunrise.&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/08/SA-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to announce that the 5th annual &lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/em&gt; image competition launches today! We are calling for ecologists around the world to submit their images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created the competition as a chance for ecologists to share their research and photographic skills, and celebrate the intersection of art and science. The four previous competitions (the overall winners of which can be seen on this page) have certainly achieved this, providing us with superb images demonstrating the complex web of interactions that ecologists are dedicated to unravelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winning images from previous years have attracted substantial attention not just from ecologists but also from the wider public, featuring in international media outlets such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2016/aug/09/bmc-ecology-image-competition-2016-the-winners-in-pictures&quot;&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/getting-big-picture-bmc-ecology-image-competition-winners/&quot;&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-33718151&quot;&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judging the competition will be the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology&lt;/em&gt; Section Editors&lt;/a&gt;, who are experts in biodiversity, ecosystems, ecological models, and behavioral ecology. The overall winner will be chosen by a special guest judge, whose identity will be announced later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall winner will receive a cash prize of £250 (~ €300/$325), while the runner-up will receive £100 (€125/$150). Additional prizes of £50 (€65/$75) will be awarded for those images selected by the Section Editors that best represent their section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_5510&quot; style=&quot;width: 2010px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The overall winner from 2014, “A Namaqua rock mouse (Aethomys namaquensis, Muridae) getting dusted with pollen of the Pagoda Lily (Whiteheadia bifolia, Hyacinthaceae) while lapping nectar at the flowers.” &quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-5510&quot; height=&quot;1446&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/08/Overall-winner-Sticky-snack-for-mice-by-Petra-Wester-compressed2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;The overall winner from 2014, by Petra Wester, “A Namaqua rock mouse (&lt;em&gt;Aethomys namaquensis&lt;/em&gt;) getting dusted with pollen of the Pagoda Lily (&lt;em&gt;Whiteheadia bifolia&lt;/em&gt;) while lapping nectar at the flowers.”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to submit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is affiliated with a research institution can enter.  We ask that entries be submitted to one of the five categories listed below &lt;strong&gt;and that they depict a specific ecological interaction&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behavioral and physiological ecology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conservation ecology and biodiversity research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Community, population, and macroecology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Landscape ecology and ecosystems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theoretical ecology and models&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will consider all images from photos to data visualizations, or a mixture of both – as long as they are striking, meaningful, and creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please email your images to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:bmcecol@biomedcentral.com&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0066cc;&quot;&gt;bmcecol@biomedcentral.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the subject line “&lt;em&gt;BMC Ecology Image Competition&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the research literature on self-serving biases, it’s little surprise that critical thinking – much needed in today’s world – is such a challenge. Consider three human biases that you may already have heard of: most of us think we’re better than average at most things (also known as illusory superiority or the Lake Wobegon Effect); we’re also prone to “confirmation bias”, which is favouring evidence that supports our existing views; and we’re also susceptible to the “endowment effect” which describes the extra value we place on things, just as soon as they are ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17470218.2015.1099162&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology&lt;/em&gt; by Aiden Gregg and his colleagues at the University of Southampton extends the list of known biases by documenting a new one that combines elements of the better-than-average effect, confirmation bias and the endowment effect. Gregg’s team have shown that simply asking participants to imagine that a theory is their own biases them to believe in the truth of that theory – a phenomenon that the researchers have called the Spontaneous Preference For Own Theories (SPOT) Effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-19958&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across three studies, the researchers asked hundreds of participants to imagine a fictional planet in a distant solar system, inhabited by various creatures some of which are predators and others prey. Focusing on two of the creatures on the planet – Niffites and Luppites – the participants were either told to imagine that they (that is, the participant himself or herself) had a theory that the Niffites were the predators and the Luppites were their prey, or that somebody called Alex had this theory. This background scenarios was chosen to be neutral and unconnected to existing beliefs, and the hypothetical “ownership” of the theory by some of the participants was intended to be as superficial and inconsequential as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers presented the participants with a series of seven facts relevant to the theory. The first few were mildly supportive of the theory (e.g. Niffites are bigger), but the last few provided strong evidence against (e.g. Luppites have been observed eating the dead bodies of Niffites). After each piece of evidence, the participants were asked to rate how likely it was that the theory was true or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way the participants interpreted the theory in the light of the evidence was influenced by the simple fact of whether they’d been asked to imagine the theory was theirs or someone else’s. When it was their own theory, they more stubbornly persisted in believing in its truth, even in the face of increasing counter-evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spontaneous bias toward one’s own theory was found across the studies: when different names were used for the creatures (Dassites and Fommites); whether testing happened online or in groups in a lecture room; regardless of age and gender; and also when an additional control condition stated that the theory was no one’s in particular, as opposed to being Alex’s. The last detail helps clarify that the bias is in favour of one’s own theory rather than against someone else’s. Surprisingly perhaps, the bias wasn’t found to be stronger in participants who scored higher for other forms of self-serving bias such as narcissism or claiming to be familiar with non-existent words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In statistical terms, the size of the bias that participants showed toward their “own” theory was modest, meaning that the practical implications of these new findings are probably limited (though the basic principle – that we’re biased towards our own theories – certainly seems relevant to understanding the wrangles over facts and truth going on in the media these days). Gregg and his colleagues said that the more important point was the theoretical implications of their results. The fact it was so easy to induce this bias in the participants, even based on such minimal personal connection to the theory, “only underlines how exquisitely sensitive to self-enhancing biases the human mind actually is,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17470218.2015.1099162&quot;&gt;The SPOT effect: People spontaneously prefer their own theories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;iStock&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/iStock_000041687012_XXXLarge-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stereotypes are widely held beliefs about the characteristics and behaviors of a group of individuals that rarely reflect reality. There are many negative stereotypes associated with mental health, most of which can be attributed to a lack of understanding; these stereotypes have led to strong social stigma attached to mental ill health, which often has a negative effect on the lives of people with mental health problems. In particular, there are lots of negative stereotypes and myths attached to self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: Self-injury isn’t common&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact numbers of how many people self-harm in the general population is hard to determine. Available research likely misrepresents how common self-harm is; published studies are usually based on people who either seek help at a hospital, or from their primary healthcare provider, after harming themselves (so called clinical samples). However, a lot of people who self-harm do not seek help; meaning that these clinical samples are not representative of self-injury rates in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published rates of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) vary hugely between studies; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24422986&quot;&gt;recent meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that many of the differences in prevalence rates reported in non-clinical samples are likely due to different definitions of self-harm behaviors and different methods of assessment between studies. After adjustment for methodological factors, the researchers calculated the pooled lifetime prevalence of NSSI to be 17.2% among adolescents, 13.4% among young adults, and 5.5% among adults. As these figures show, people of all ages self-injure – it is not just a teenage thing – but there is far less data available about the rates of self-injury in adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_8618&quot; style=&quot;width: 252px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;CHRISTIAAN TONNIS, Flickr CC &quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8618 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/8881851404_684d369c59_z-242x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;242&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Female Warrior #17 – CHRISTIAAN TONNIS, Flickr CC&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: Only women self-harm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often assumed that women and girls are more likely to engage in self-harm, however the evidence in the published literature is conflicting, depending on the country, age range and type of sample (e.g. clinical, college, community) studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25795294&quot;&gt;recent meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, which included 120 studies that contain demographically diverse samples, suggests that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25795294&quot;&gt;women are slightly more likely than men to engage in NSSI&lt;/a&gt;”, but the overall rate of NSSI identified among males (26.36%) was still remarkably high. They also found that “the gender difference was larger in clinical samples compared to both community and college samples”, suggesting that males who engage in NSSI may be less likely to seek out help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: People who self-harm are suicidal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-harm is sometimes viewed as a suicide attempt by people who don’t understand it. By its very definition the term NSSI describes the intentional destruction of one’s own body tissue without suicidal intent, and for purposes not socially sanctioned. For the majority of people who self-harm it is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17014942&quot;&gt;emotion regulation strategy&lt;/a&gt; – it’s about trying to cope with difficult feelings and circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there is a relationship between self-harm and suicide – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25617686&quot;&gt;those who self-harm are at greater risk than the general population&lt;/a&gt; – many more people self-harm than commit suicide. However, some people who self-harm also have suicidal feelings and might attempt to take their own life, which is why self-harm must always be taken seriously!&lt;/p&gt;

The most common form of NFT uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography&quot; title=&quot;Electroencephalography&quot;&gt;EEG&lt;/a&gt; (brainwave) activity recorded non-invasively from the scalp. The EEG is a complex mixture of neural oscillations of different frequencies. Specific frequency bands are targeted for enhancement or reduction, so the participant can learn to modulate their own brain activity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An overview of the neurofeedback process is shown below. Signals are recorded from sensors, processed, and classified. The calculated signal is then presented to  the subject via feedback in one or more sensory modalities. Participants can learn to modulate their neural function, and  complete the loop when the feedback is processed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;- click on image for a larger view -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8CseEVR2Ox8/WLYNzPBUSVI/AAAAAAAAMCs/Gj5hykuQUFEwAL0LphlkwFZut-6bbrRoACLcB/s1600/Neurofeedback%2Bin%2BNRN.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;143&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8CseEVR2Ox8/WLYNzPBUSVI/AAAAAAAAMCs/Gj5hykuQUFEwAL0LphlkwFZut-6bbrRoACLcB/s320/Neurofeedback%2Bin%2BNRN.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;modified from Fig 1 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrn.2016.164&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sitaram et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; The methods included here are electroencephalography (EEG), &lt;span&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;agnetoencephalography (MEG) and invasive electrocorticography (ECoG)&lt;span&gt;. MVPA, multivariate patterns of activity. FFT, fast Fourier transformation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one study, participants were trained to reduce the amplitude of alpha oscillations, with a goal of increasing long-range temporal correlations  (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhw285&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ros et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;). Here's a description of the training procedure:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;For online training, the EEG signal was ... band-pass filtered to extract alpha (8–12 Hz) amplitude with an epoch size of 0.5 s. Here, subjects were rewarded upon reduction of their absolute alpha amplitude... Visual feedback was clearly displayed on a monitor via 1) a dynamic bar graph at the center of the screen whose height was proportional to real-time alpha fluctuations and 2) a “Space Race” game, where a spaceship advanced through space when amplitude was below threshold, and became stationary when above threshold. No explicit instructions were given on how to achieve control over the spaceship, and all participants were told to be guided by the visual feedback process.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a sham condition, the participants were shown feedback recorded from another subject in an earlier session  (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhw285&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ros et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;). Having a sham (or placebo) condition is critical for demonstrating that any gains in performance (or increases in long-range temporal correlations, in this example) are due to self-regulation of specific EEG features learned during training, and not from some generic aspect of the procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In academic articles, neurofeedback is often called closed-loop brain training, perhaps to distinguish it from neurofeedback &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;therapy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (also NFT). A recent paper in &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrn.2016.164&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Reviews Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; discussed experimental applications of NFT&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and theories of the underlying mechanisms. Animal studies have demonstrated that rats and monkeys are capable of modulating the firing rates of small groups of neurons. Models of neurofeedback learning include instrumental (operant) conditioning, motor learning, global workspace theory, and skill learning. Exciting and important research ventures that capitalize on NFT are applications to brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and brain-machine interfaces (BMI), which have allowed paralyzed individuals to &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e18554#fig1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;type&lt;/a&gt; and move prosthetic hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Psychiatric applications of NFT have been more problematic. First, you have to correctly identify the frequency band(s) that are abnormal in a clinical population. Then you must have a principled method for selecting the NFT protocol. Finally, you must demonstrate that your specific NFT protocol is superior to sham feedback (in a randomized, controlled trial). Unfortunately, this is rarely done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neurofeedback therapy has received critical coverage from the press in recent weeks. The new U.S. Secretary of Education, billionaire &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsy_DeVos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Betsy DeVos&lt;/a&gt;, has a major financial stake in an NFT company called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neurocorecenters.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Neurocore&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; ran two articles critical of both DeVoss's conflict of interest and of the supposed benefits of NFT. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/business/dealbook/betsy-devos-neurocore.html?_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Betsy DeVos Won’t Shed Stake in Biofeedback Company, Filings Show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ms. DeVos and her husband promote Neurocore heavily on the website for Windquest Group, a family office the couple use to manage some of their many investments...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the claims that Neurocore’s methods can help children improve their performance in school could present a conflict for Ms. DeVos if she is confirmed as education secretary — especially given that the company is moving to expand its national reach.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/politics/betsy-devos-neurocore-brain-centers.html?_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Betsy DeVos Invests in a Therapy Under Scrutiny&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neurocore has not published its results in peer-reviewed medical literature. Its techniques — including mapping brain waves to diagnose problems and using neurofeedback, a form of biofeedback, to treat them — are not considered standards of care for the majority of the disorders it treats, including autism. Social workers, not doctors, perform assessments, and low-paid technicians with little training apply the methods to patients, including children with complex problems.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;And Neurocore is in no way unique.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Hundreds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=neurofeedback+center&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Neurofeedback Centers&lt;/a&gt; offer cures for everything from A to T by merely wearing a few electrodes and playing a computer game for 20-30 sessions (and $2,000-3,000).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADD / ADHD&lt;br /&gt;Addiction&lt;br /&gt;Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;br /&gt;Anger Management&lt;br /&gt;Anxiety&lt;br /&gt;Attachment Disorders&lt;br /&gt;Autism&lt;br /&gt;Bipolar Disorder&lt;br /&gt;Borderline Personality Disorder&lt;br /&gt;Chronic Pain&lt;br /&gt;Conduct Disorders&lt;br /&gt;Depression&lt;br /&gt;Dyslexia&lt;br /&gt;Epilepsy / Seizures&lt;br /&gt;Fibromyalgia&lt;br /&gt;Insomnia / Sleep Disorders&lt;br /&gt;Learning Disorders&lt;br /&gt;Lyme Disease&lt;br /&gt;Memory Loss&lt;br /&gt;Migraines&lt;br /&gt;Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder &lt;br /&gt;OCD / Tourrette’s&lt;br /&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;br /&gt;Pre-Menstrual Syndrome&lt;br /&gt;Stress / PTSD&lt;br /&gt;Schizophrenia&lt;br /&gt;Sleep Disorders&lt;br /&gt;Stroke&lt;br /&gt;Substance Abuse&lt;br /&gt;Tourette’s Syndrome &lt;br /&gt;Traumatic Brain Injury&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pitches are often targeted to concerned parents, but there is little to no evidence that the therapy offered at most of these centers is based on sound scientific research. As mentioned, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trials are rarely conducted. &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/razlab.org/publications/Preprint_AMP_ThibaultRaz.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Thibault and &lt;/span&gt;Raz&lt;/a&gt; (2017) have been particularly vocal about the lack of rigor in published studies, as well as the inflated claims of successful treatment.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Advocates of neurofeedback make bold claims concerning brain regulation, treatment of disorders, and mental health. Decades of research and thousands of peer-reviewed publications support neurofeedback using electroencephalography (EEG-nf); yet, few experiments isolate the act of receiving feedback from a specific brain signal as a necessary precursor to obtain the purported benefits. Moreover, while psychosocial parameters including participant motivation and expectation, rather than neurobiological substrates, seem to fuel clinical improvement across a wide range of disorders, for-profit clinics continue to sprout across North America and Europe. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's how Neurocore describes its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neurocorecenters.com/treatment/sleep/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Natural Sleep Disorder Therapy&lt;/a&gt; for insomnia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Neurofeedback. Natural treatment for sleep disorders &amp;amp; insomnia.&lt;/h4&gt;Neurocore’s approach to treating insomnia and sleeping disorders  starts by looking at the brain. Using advanced qEEG technology, we  measure your brainwaves to help identify the cause of the problem. We  also monitor your heart rate and evaluate how in sync it is with your  breathing pattern. Your unique neurometrics yield a customized  neurofeedback training program that will teach your brain to  self-regulate. The result is a brain that’s calibrated for better  ongoing recovery, which means better sleep for you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Neurocore “neurometrics” are not obtained from a clinical sleep study (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28118865&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;polysomnography&lt;/a&gt;) which measures not only brain and heart activity, but also muscle activity, eye movements, and respiration. They haven't identified the “cause of the problem”. It could be &lt;a href=&quot;https://sleepfoundation.org/insomnia/content/what-causes-insomnia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; or another medical condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awx011&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brand new evidence&lt;/a&gt; indicates that targeted, sensorimotor-rhythm (SMR) NFT for insomnia is no better than sham feedback. Earlier work had suggested that training to increase 12-15 Hz activity over the sensorimotor cortex could improve sleep by enhancing sleep spindles, which are in the same 12-15 Hz frequency range. In the new study, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awx011&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Schabus et al. (2017)&lt;/a&gt; took 25 patients with insomnia and administered 12 sessions of real neurofeedback and 12 sessions of sham neurofeedback, also called placebo feedback training (PFT):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Importantly, during the NFT condition, participants had to enhance EEG amplitudes in the SMR range between 12 and 15 Hz, whereas during the PFT sessions participants had to enhance random frequency ranges between 7 and 20 Hz (but not the 12–15 Hz SMR range); importantly within a PFT session only one frequency was trained and rewarded. The reason for choosing this kind of placebo or sham protocol was to involve patients to a similar degree as in NFT, yet with no specific frequency being rewarded systematically. Rewarding another frequency systematically could have resulted in undesired effects on EEG and behaviour that would render the PFT control condition suboptimal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outcome variables were objective (EEG) and subjective measures of sleep quality. A forthcoming commentary from &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/razlab.org/publications/Brain2017_PostPrint_ThibaultLifshitzRaz.docx.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thibault et al. (2017)&lt;/a&gt; summarizes the results in a nifty cartoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-j4RzESr009Y/WLZTssDTepI/AAAAAAAAMDA/kcAHfjqPBEA0Zd-KPiQ7_3XnLMhtV-A1wCLcB/s1600/comparing%2Bregular%2Band%2Bsham%2Bneurofeedback.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;263&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-j4RzESr009Y/WLZTssDTepI/AAAAAAAAMDA/kcAHfjqPBEA0Zd-KPiQ7_3XnLMhtV-A1wCLcB/s400/comparing%2Bregular%2Band%2Bsham%2Bneurofeedback.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As expected, when participants received genuine neurofeedback, they were able to significantly increase power in the SMR frequency band. This was not the case during sham neurofeedback sessions. Genuine neurofeedback did not alter objective measures of sleep quality (nor did sham). The most important result came in the patient ratings of subjective sleep quality. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Genuine SMR neurofeedback improved subjective sleep measures, BUT SO DID SHAM NEUROFEEDBACK. This suggests that any benefit obtained from NFT was due to a placebo effect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Although this was a small study with some complications (e.g., nine of the 25 patients were “misperception” insomniacs with no objective indicators of insomnia), the results were informative about the cause of subjective improvements — they were non-specific in nature and did not rely on training SMR activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their commentary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/razlab.org/publications/Brain2017_PostPrint_ThibaultLifshitzRaz.docx.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thibault et al. (2017)&lt;/a&gt; refer to NFT as a &lt;b&gt;superplacebo&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Whether real or sham, neurofeedback demands high engagement and immerses patients in a seemingly cutting-edge technological environment over many recurring sessions. ... In this regard, neurofeedback may represent an especially powerful form of placebo intervention—a kind of &lt;b&gt;superplacebo&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amusingly, they define &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;superplacebo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as “A treatment that is actually a placebo although neither the prescribing practitioner nor the receiving patient is aware of the absence of evidence to recommend it therapeutically.” If everyone thinks neurofeedback treatment works, it is more likely to do so, even though it bears no relation to self-regulation of selective neural activity. Future studies with refined NFT protocols may yet “tune” the brain in a desired direction, but for now... buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further Reading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/brain-training-future-psychiatric-treatment/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brain training: The future of psychiatric treatment?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/inside-school-research/2017/01/devos-associated_company_alleg.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DeVos-Associated Company Alleges Brain-Training Autism 'Fix'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The paper also reviewed neurofeedback studies that use hemodynamic measures.

 &lt;p&gt;Loss of proteostasis underlies ageing and neurodegeneration characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although many neurodegenerative-disease-associated proteins can be found in mitochondria, it remains unclear how mitochondrial dysfunction and protein aggregation could be related. In dividing yeast cells, protein aggregates that form under stress or during ageing are preferentially retained by the mother cell, in part through tethering to mitochondria, while the disaggregase Hsp104 helps to dissociate aggregates and thereby enables refolding or degradation of misfolded proteins. Here we show that, in yeast, cytosolic proteins prone to aggregation are imported into mitochondria for degradation. Protein aggregates that form under heat shock contain both cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins and interact with the mitochondrial import complex. Many aggregation-prone proteins enter the mitochondrial intermembrane space and matrix after heat shock, and some do so even without stress. Timely dissolution of cytosolic aggregates requires the mitochondrial import machinery and proteases. Blocking mitochondrial import but not proteasome activity causes a marked delay in the degradation of aggregated proteins. Defects in cytosolic Hsp70s leads to enhanced entry of misfolded proteins into mitochondria and elevated mitochondrial stress. We term this mitochondria-mediated proteostasis mechanism MAGIC (mitochondria as guardian in cytosol) and provide evidence that it may exist in human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature   &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21695&quot;&gt;doi: 10.1038/nature21695&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/Dtoqx7x6sWg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Recurrent chromosomal translocations producing a chimaeric MLL oncogene give rise to a highly aggressive acute leukaemia associated with poor clinical outcome. The preferential involvement of chromatin-associated factors as MLL fusion partners belies a dependency on transcription control. Despite recent progress made in targeting chromatin regulators in cancer, available therapies for this well-characterized disease remain inadequate, prompting the need to identify new targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, using unbiased CRISPR–Cas9 technology to perform a genome-scale loss-of-function screen in an MLL-AF4-positive acute leukaemia cell line, we identify ENL as an unrecognized gene that is specifically required for proliferation in vitro and in vivo. To explain the mechanistic role of ENL in leukaemia pathogenesis and dynamic transcription control, a chemical genetic strategy was developed to achieve targeted protein degradation. Acute loss of ENL suppressed the initiation and elongation of RNA polymerase II at active genes genome-wide, with pronounced effects at genes featuring a disproportionate ENL load. Notably, an intact YEATS chromatin-reader domain was essential for ENL-dependent leukaemic growth. Overall, these findings identify a dependency factor in acute leukaemia and suggest a mechanistic rationale for disrupting the YEATS domain in disease.

 Cancer cells are characterized by aberrant epigenetic landscapes and often exploit chromatin machinery to activate oncogenic gene expression programs. Recognition of modified histones by ‘reader’ proteins constitutes a key mechanism underlying these processes; therefore, targeting such pathways holds clinical promise, as exemplified by the development of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitors. We recently identified the YEATS domain as an acetyl-lysine-binding module, but its functional importance in human cancer remains unknown. Here we show that the YEATS domain-containing protein ENL, but not its paralogue AF9, is required for disease maintenance in acute myeloid leukaemia. CRISPR–Cas9-mediated depletion of ENL led to anti-leukaemic effects, including increased terminal myeloid differentiation and suppression of leukaemia growth in vitro and in vivo. Biochemical and crystal structural studies and chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing analyses revealed that ENL binds to acetylated histone H3, and co-localizes with H3K27ac and H3K9ac on the promoters of actively transcribed genes that are essential for leukaemia. Disrupting the interaction between the YEATS domain and histone acetylation via structure-based mutagenesis reduced the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to ENL-target genes, leading to the suppression of oncogenic gene expression programs. Notably, disrupting the functionality of ENL further sensitized leukaemia cells to BET inhibitors. Together, our data identify ENL as a histone acetylation reader that regulates oncogenic transcriptional programs in acute myeloid leukaemia, and suggest that displacement of ENL from chromatin may be a promising epigenetic therapy, alone or in combination with BET inhibitors, for aggressive leukaemia.

 The conserved Mediator co-activator complex has an essential role in the regulation of RNA polymerase II transcription in all eukaryotes. Understanding the structure and interactions of Mediator is crucial for determining how the complex influences transcription initiation and conveys regulatory information to the basal transcription machinery. Here we present a 4.4 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy map of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mediator in which conserved Mediator subunits are individually resolved. The essential Med14 subunit works as a central backbone that connects the Mediator head, middle and tail modules. Comparison with a 7.8 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy map of a Mediator–RNA polymerase II holoenzyme reveals that changes in the structure of Med14 facilitate a large-scale Mediator rearrangement that is essential for holoenzyme formation. Our study suggests that access to different conformations and crosstalk between structural elements are essential for the Mediator regulation mechanism, and could explain the capacity of the complex to integrate multiple regulatory signals.

 With age, haematopoietic stem cells lose their ability to regenerate the blood system, and promote disease development. Autophagy is associated with health and longevity, and is critical for protecting haematopoietic stem cells from metabolic stress. Here we show that loss of autophagy in haematopoietic stem cells causes accumulation of mitochondria and an activated metabolic state, which drives accelerated myeloid differentiation mainly through epigenetic deregulations, and impairs haematopoietic stem-cell self-renewal activity and regenerative potential. Strikingly, most haematopoietic stem cells in aged mice share these altered metabolic and functional features. However, approximately one-third of aged haematopoietic stem cells exhibit high autophagy levels and maintain a low metabolic state with robust long-term regeneration potential similar to healthy young haematopoietic stem cells. Our results demonstrate that autophagy actively suppresses haematopoietic stem-cell metabolism by clearing active, healthy mitochondria to maintain quiescence and stemness, and becomes increasingly necessary with age to preserve the regenerative capacity of old haematopoietic stem cells.

 The nuclear lamina is a fundamental constituent of metazoan nuclei. It is composed mainly of lamins, which are intermediate filament proteins that assemble into a filamentous meshwork, bridging the nuclear envelope and chromatin. Besides providing structural stability to the nucleus, the lamina is involved in many nuclear activities, including chromatin organization, transcription and replication. However, the structural organization of the nuclear lamina is poorly understood. Here we use cryo-electron tomography to obtain a detailed view of the organization of the lamin meshwork within the lamina. Data analysis of individual lamin filaments resolves a globular-decorated fibre appearance and shows that A- and B-type lamins assemble into tetrameric filaments of 3.5 nm thickness. Thus, lamins exhibit a structure that is remarkably different from the other canonical cytoskeletal elements. Our findings define the architecture of the nuclear lamin meshworks at molecular resolution, providing insights into their role in scaffolding the nuclear lamina.
