 A new paper in Nature Human Behaviour has generated lots of debate. In Redefine Statistical Significance, authors Daniel J. Benjamin and colleagues suggest changing the convention that p-values below 0.05 are called 'significant'. Instead, they suggest, the cut-off should be set at 0.005 - a stricter criterion.



Over at The Brains Blog, John Schwenkler organized a discussion of the Benjamin et al. proposal, featuring commentary from several statisticians and researchers.

&lt;p&gt;There are behavioural differences, on average, between the sexes – few would dispute that. Where the debate rages is over how much these differences are the result of social pressures versus being rooted in our biology (the answer often is that there is a complex interaction between the two).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when differences are observed between girls and boys, such as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/06/03/infants-show-a-preference-for-toys-that-match-their-gender-before-they-know-what-gender-is/&quot;&gt;different preferences for play&lt;/a&gt;, one possibility is that this is partly or wholly because of the contrasting ways that girls and boys are influenced by their peers, parents and other adults (because of the ideas they have about how the sexes ought to behave).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying non-human primates allows us to remove human culture and gender beliefs from the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning more about the biological roots of behavioural sex differences should not be used as an excuse for harmful stereotyping or discrimination, but it can help us better understand our human nature and the part that evolved sex differences play in some of the most important issues that affect our lives, including around diversity, relationships, mental health, crime and education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, as part of a special issue of the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience Research – &lt;/em&gt;titled “An Issue Whose Time Has Come: Sex/Gender Influences on Nervous System Function” – &lt;span class=&quot;enhanced-author e7f4b551-07bb-48a5-9a6f-26b737f6f8dc enhanced-underline-draw hover current-selection active&quot;&gt;Elizabeth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;enhanced-author e7f4b551-07bb-48a5-9a6f-26b737f6f8dc enhanced-underline-draw hover current-selection active&quot;&gt;Lonsdorf at Franklin and Marshall College published &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.23862/full&quot;&gt;a useful mini-review detailing some of the sex differences observed among monkey and ape infants and juveniles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In human cultures across the world, &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1611&amp;amp;context=psychfacpub&quot;&gt;boys tend to spend more time away from their mothers&lt;/a&gt; as compared with girls, which may reflect an early tendency toward greater risk taking. The same is true in chimps. For a 2014 paper, Lonsdorf and her colleagues, including famed zoologist Jane Goodall, conducted &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0099099#&quot;&gt;the most detailed ever analysis of the development of wild chimpanzees&lt;/a&gt;, observing 40 chimps from birth to age 5. They found that, by age 3, male infants showed greater physical distance from their mothers than females. The males began moving about on their own earlier than females and covered more distances independently. These and other findings from the study “suggest that some biologically based sex differences in behavior may have been present in the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans, and operated independently from the influences of modern sex-biased parental behavior and gender socialization,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Baby girl monkeys are more social &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, girls tend to show more precocious social interest and development than boys. For example, at less than two-days old, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163638300000321&quot;&gt;girls spend more time than boys looking at a human face than at a mechanical toy&lt;/a&gt;. Though a replication attempt of this specific finding for humans is needed, a very similar pattern has been found in rhesus macaque monkeys. For &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4726418/&quot;&gt;a paper published last year&lt;/a&gt; a research team led by Elizabeth Simpson observed 48 two- to three-week old monkeys as they were presented with videos of a macaque monkey face. The females spent more time looking at the videos than males and they later displayed more social behaviour toward a human. “In sum, converging evidence from humans and monkeys suggests that female infants are more social than males in the first weeks of life, and that such differences may arise independent of postnatal experience,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boy monkeys enjoy more rough and tumble &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In human children, average sex differences in &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/06/03/infants-show-a-preference-for-toys-that-match-their-gender-before-they-know-what-gender-is/&quot;&gt;play&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/08/10/why-pink-lego-might-be-bad-for-girls/&quot;&gt;preferences&lt;/a&gt; are among the most striking, consistent (and controversial) behavioural contrasts found between boys and girls. It never seems to take very long for little boys to pick up sticks and pretend that they are armed with a sword. In contrast, girls typically spend more time pretending to nurture toy dolls or similar. Of course, many say this simply reflects the way that boys are raised to be more aggressive and girls more nurturing. And yet very similar sex-linked play preferences are seen in our primate cousins.&lt;/p&gt;

Males also initiated play more often than females. In her review, Lonsdorf notes that similar findings have been observed in blue monkeys, patas monkeys, Japanese macaques and olive baboons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Girl monkeys spend more time playing parent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1128681?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents&quot;&gt;Human boys, on average, are less interested than girls in babies&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a similar pattern among non-human primates. &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03327332&quot;&gt;Observational research&lt;/a&gt; at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center with one-year-old Rhesus Macaque monkeys found that the females spent significantly more time than the males with infants. “The focus of young females’ attention on infants has been suggested to be important for the development of later maternal skills,” the researchers said. They noted that a similar observation has been found for another species: “Juvenile female vervet monkeys that live in the wild carry and cuddle small infants, an experience that may provide them with the motor skills necessary for later matemal behavior, as weIl as give them exposure to the maternal role. It is likely that this experience is similarly useful for a yearling rhesus monkey”. Lonsdorf observes in her review that a female bias for nurturing style play has also been seen in lowland gorillas and blue monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boy monkeys like learning from their dads, girl monkeys from their mums&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s little doubt that biological differences between the sexes are amplified by parenting practices and parent-child relationships, including boys’ tendency to want to emulate their dads and girls to emulate their mothers – as seen both in humans and our primate cousins. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2728904/&quot;&gt;in a study of capuchin monkeys&lt;/a&gt;, Susan Perry looked to see whether infants adopted one of two different techniques (pounding or scrubbing) for extracting seeds from fruit – girls, but not boys, typically adopted whichever technique was used by their mothers. In wild tufted capuchins, meanwhile, &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajp.20120/abstract&quot;&gt;male juveniles typically stick with their dads and copy their dietary preferences&lt;/a&gt;, such as favouring eating animals over fruit (the latter preferred by females). It’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347205001831&quot;&gt;a similar story for chimps and termite fishing&lt;/a&gt; with research showing how females are better at this task than males and that female infants spend more time than their boy peers watching and learning from their mothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Taken as a whole,” Lonsdorf concludes, “these consistent and accumulating reports of sex differences in primate behavioral development suggest that, although gender socialization in humans plays a role in magnifying the differences between young males and females, these behavioral sex differences are rooted in our biological and evolutionary heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.23862/full&quot;&gt;Sex Differences In Nonhuman Primate Behavioral Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mission of the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation is to improve health by “accelerating support for medical research through recognition of research excellence, education and advocacy.” Each year, Lasker Awards are given to scientists that embody this mission. Organizations are also eligible for awards through the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/show/essential-health-services-and-reproductive-care/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lasker~Bloomberg Public Service Award&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that alternates years with the Lasker~Koshland Special Achievement Award in Medical Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_7762&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7762 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/10/Sommer-Jacket-Square-5x5-300x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Dr. Alfred Sommer; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s recipient of the Public Service Award is Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), “for providing essential health services and reproductive care to millions of women for more than a century.” PPFA began in Brooklyn, New York, where in 1916 Margaret Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the US; in 1942 the organization changed its name from The American Birth Control League to Planned Parenthood. To place the 2017 Lasker~Bloomberg Public Service Award in context, PLOS interviewed Chair of the Jury &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jhsph.edu/admissions/scholarships/institutional-scholarships/sommer-scholars/about/alfred-sommer-bio.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alfred Sommer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, University Distinguished Service Professor and Dean Emeritus, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this award, PPFA joins other collaborative efforts including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/msf-receives-lasker-bloomberg-public-service-award&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Médecins Sans Frontières&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Lasker-Bloomberg-Award-Acceptance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cc.nih.gov/ccaward.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NIH Clinical Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as Lasker Public Service Awardees. Since recent previous awardees in this category were individuals, PLOS asked Sommer what does this say about how science and medicine work today, or about the efforts needed to impact human health. &lt;strong&gt;“The intent of the Public Service Award has always been recognition of contributions to expanding investments in biomedical/health research and advancing the public’s health,”&lt;/strong&gt; he responds. “In recent years there has been slightly greater attention paid to the latter, and therefore to the individuals and institutions that have made a real difference.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sommer was circumspect and honest when asked to reflect on the timing of the committee’s decision process, in relation to political discourse in the US at that time over the proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act with a plan that would defund approximately 40% of Planned Parenthood’s annual budget. “The discussion is always free-wheeling, and every member is free to raise whatever perspectives they like,” he says. “I am not at liberty to discuss the actual vote, but I can say there was broad agreement with this year’s choice (as there usually is every year, once the discussion and votes are taken).” He continues that the Lasker Awards are “meant to recognize extraordinary achievements, and bring these achievements to the attention of the public. It was no different in this case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/show/essential-health-services-and-reproductive-care/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;origin story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of Planned Parenthood is fascinating. While family planning may be the founding service, it’s likely the public doesn’t realize the breadth of services offered by the organization, from sex education programs that reach 1.5 million people annually to over 4 million tests and treatments to both men and women (in 2015 alone) for sexually transmitted infections. “The purpose of all Lasker Awards is to better inform the public about the individual, work, and organization that is being honored,” says Sommer. In recognizing PPFA, he continues, “we would hope that the public will have a better understanding of all the contributions to health made by PPFA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While publications and publicity are not a requirement for receipt of the Public Service Award, placing this type of information into the public domain helps to inform policy and to improve health outcomes. Among the PLOS journals, two articles have corresponding or contributing authors affiliated with PPFA. In the recent &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; article, “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180250&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Parents’ views on sex education in schools: How much do Democrats and Republicans agree?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” researchers from Planned Parenthood found that comprehensive sex education is supported by a vast majority of parents, both Democrats and Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;article, “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002110&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Comparison of Outcomes before and after Ohio’s Law Mandating Use of the FDA-Approved Protocol for Medication Abortion: A Retrospective Cohort Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” researchers followed outcomes of a law that took effect in 2011 requiring abortion providers to follow specific US Food and Drug Administration guidelines, created in 2000, when giving patients a combination of two drugs to induce abortion. Their findings, covered by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/30/ohio-abortion-pill-law-mifepristone-study&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-abortion-complications-ohio-20160830-snap-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, indicate that women experienced a higher rate of complications and were nearly three times more likely to require additional medical intervention after the law was implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some say that receiving a Lasker Award hints at prediction of a Nobel Prize. To put this attention to awards and prizes in context, it’s worth understanding the compelling origins and motivations of the Lasker Foundation directly from “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laskerfoundation.org/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Lasker Legacy&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;/strong&gt;video. After watching you might want to make your voice heard through suggested resources on the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/march-for-science&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Stand Up for Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; webpage. Work from individual scientists receiving this year’s Lasker Awards is described &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/09/2017-lasker-awards/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in a previous post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Psychotherapy that encourages addressing emotional experiences related to trauma, conflict, and relationship problems has been found helpful for people with the chronic pain condition fibromyalgia.In the randomized clinical trial at Wayne State University in Detroit, 230 adults with &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2008/03/31/new-treatment-option-for-difficult-diseases/&quot;&gt;fibromyalgia&lt;/a&gt; received one of three treatments. Each was presented for eight weekly sessions to small groups of patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new therapy, called Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET), helps patients view their pain and other symptoms as stemming from changeable neural pathways in the brain that are strongly influenced by &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/10/22/comparing-the-5-theories-of-emotion/&quot;&gt;emotions&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EAET helps patients process emotional experiences, such as disclosing important struggles, learning how to adaptively express important feelings—especially anger and sadness, but also &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/26/learning-how-to-practice-being-grateful-and-reap-the-benefits/&quot;&gt;gratitude&lt;/a&gt;, compassion, and forgiveness—and empowering people to be more honest and direct in relationships that have been conflicted or problematic, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EAET intervention was compared to both an educational intervention, as well as the gold standard psychological approach in the field, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/06/05/the-cognitive-behavioral-miracle-controlling-your-emotions/&quot;&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt;. Six months after treatments ended, patients were evaluated for the severity and extent of their pain and other problems that people with fibromyalgia often experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who received EAET had better outcomes—reduced widespread &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/27/neurofeedback-therapy-for-the-management-of-pain/&quot;&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt;, physical impairment, attention and concentration problems, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/02/14/got-anxiety-got-smarts/&quot;&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/08/new-target-in-brain-for-treating-depression-the-bmp-pathway/&quot;&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, and more positive emotions and life satisfaction—than patients who received the education intervention, the researchers report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than twice as many people in EAET (34.8 percent) reported that they were “much better” or “very much better” than before treatment, compared to 15.4 percent of education patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important additional finding was that the new emotion therapy also had greater benefits than cognitive behavior therapy in reducing widespread pain and in the number of patients who achieved at least 50 percent pain reduction, the researchers point out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark A. Lumley, Ph.D., a professor of psychology said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people with fibromyalgia have experienced adversity in their lives, including victimization, family problems, and internal conflicts, all of which create important emotions that are often suppressed or avoided. Emerging neuroscience research suggests that this can contribute strongly to pain and other physical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed and tested an approach that tries to help people overcome these emotional and relationship problems and reduce their symptoms, rather than just help people manage or accept their fibromyalgia. Although this treatment does not help all people with fibromyalgia, many patients found it to be very helpful, and some had dramatic improvements in their lives and their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wayne State researchers collaborated with a team of researchers from the University of Michigan Medical Center led by David A. Williams, Ph.D., a professor of anesthesiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;PAIN&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time a terrorist attack has begun, the security services have already failed. But the challenge they face in detecting potential attacks is substantial, especially since the tactic of terrorism has increasingly been taken up by individual attackers inspired by, but not directly beholden to, formal movements. Spotting a lone wolf among the flock is no easy task, especially when it relies on a bottleneck of human analysis. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178916301495&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Aggression and Violent Behavior&lt;/i&gt; uses a test case of a real lone wolf attack to explore ways we may be able to deal with this in the future. Using online language analysis tools, it hunts within blocks of text for the warning signs we might otherwise miss, with the hope of helping us to more effectively detect the predator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-30673&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giti Zahedzadeh of the Centre for Neuroeconomic Studies at Claremont Graduate University in California wanted to see what insights could be gleaned about violent tendencies by analysing text using the open-source web application &lt;a href=&quot;http://voyant-tools.org&quot;&gt;Voyant&lt;/a&gt;. The application has a number of features such as creating word clouds, word frequency lists, and word association chains to pull out patterns from blocks of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raw data Zahedzadeh used were writings by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidal_Hasan&quot;&gt;Nidal Hasan&lt;/a&gt;, the US military psychiatrist who turned traitor and went on an ideologically motivated mass shooting in 2009 in Fort Hood, Texas, killing 13 and injuring many more. Hasan, who is now incarcerated awaiting execution, received some attention from authorities before his crime but he was never classified as “being involved in terrorist activities,” leaving him a free hand to commit his attack. Were warning signs missed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Voyant programme was first applied on a powerpoint presentation Hasan gave two years before the attack, as part of the final stage of his medical training. He chose the topic “The Qur’anic World View As It Relates to Muslims in the U.S. Military.” Its purpose was ostensibly to explore the topic to inform policy and treatment, but with the benefit of hindsight, one can see an individual working out in public his own misgivings and sounding out justifications for a course of action. Using Voyant, Zahedzadeh was able to visually zoom through key words and explore their associations, such as “fight”, “cause”, and “important”, and generate a word cloud highlighting the prominence of the words “god” and “submission” in one of the sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more interesting is the email exchange between Hasan and a radical cleric, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_al-Awlaki&quot;&gt;Anwar al-Awlaki&lt;/a&gt; (who was later killed by a US drone strike in Yemen in 2011). Al-Awlaki presided over the funeral of Hasan’s mother some years prior to Hasan’s atrocity, but had since moved to Yemen to continue his activities with less interference. The exchange shows Hasan testing out ideas and probing whether certain violent actions could be consistent with Islamic law. These messages were picked up at the time by the Joint Terrorism Task Force but ultimately not acted on. However, the Voyant analysis pulled out a number of red flags, such as a high coincidence of the term “permissible” in the context of the word “suicide”, and the pairing of “intention”, “kill,” and “soldiers” – the latter precisely reflecting the act Hasan was to go on to conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, reading the text with the benefit of hindsight, the warning signs feel like they jump out at you without the need to collate word patterns, but of course, it’s easy to spot signs of something once you know about it. The purpose of using a technology approach is to foreground patterns that may seem otherwise innocuous, objectively presenting frequencies and interconnections in black and white. Moreover, gathering this kind of data into a larger corpus, based upon many cases, could help us understand “the process in which an individual moves from radical opinion to violent action,” Zahedzadeh said.&lt;/p&gt;

(2005)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other dementias are progressive neurodegenerative conditions that unfold over time. Subtle symptoms such as forgetfulness and word finding problems may progress to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673606685425&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mild cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; (MCI), and then escalate to full-blown dementia. Recent efforts to classify &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2881320/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Defining 'Prodromal' Alzheimer’s Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, and Lewy Body Dementia: Are we there yet?&quot;&gt;prodromal states&lt;/a&gt; have included automated analysis of spontaneous speech, which loses complexity as the disease progresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one study, &lt;strike&gt;Frazier&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JAD-150520&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fraser et al. (2015)&lt;/a&gt; applied machine learning methods to speech transcripts and audio files from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.talkbank.org/DementiaBank/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DementiaBank&lt;/a&gt; database. The participants were 167 patients with probable AD and 97 controls. The authors considered a total of 370 linguistic features, and found that a subset of 35 was able to classify patients vs. controls with 82% accuracy.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While an advance over previous studies, this is not yet useful for diagnostic purposes.

Presidential press conferences provide another rich source of data for linguistic analysis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25633673&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Berisha et al. (2015)&lt;/a&gt; examined &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transcripts&lt;/a&gt; from the press conferences given by Ronald Reagan (1981-1989) and George H.W. Bush (1989-1993). We know that President Reagan received a formal diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in 1994, five years after leaving office. And as far as we know, the elder Bush is still cognitively intact for his age (he's 92 now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quantified linguistic features included:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Number of unique words&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-specific nouns – e.g., &lt;i&gt;thing, something, anything&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Filler words – &lt;i&gt;well, so, basically, actually, literally, um, ah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low-imageability, high frequency verbs &lt;i&gt;– e.g., &lt;i&gt;get, give, go, have, do&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reagan showed a significant decline in the number of unique words over the course of his presidency, but Bush did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W3MMHZEZQqg/WKloZbS7jEI/AAAAAAAAMB4/oJKTD80k2o0HFZLiepXi0dVUEKS43k6YACLcB/s1600/unique%2Bwords_linked%2Bto%2BAD%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;177&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W3MMHZEZQqg/WKloZbS7jEI/AAAAAAAAMB4/oJKTD80k2o0HFZLiepXi0dVUEKS43k6YACLcB/s400/unique%2Bwords_linked%2Bto%2BAD%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, Reagan showed a significant &lt;i&gt;increase&lt;/i&gt; in the use of non-specific nouns and fillers, but Bush did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L2r3dyRDBak/WKloZfPjJ4I/AAAAAAAAMB0/fbUHrn28BPgSlF1ZKIMXycTB1fMrDZN_wCLcB/s1600/non-specific%2Bnouns%2Band%2Bfillers%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;167&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L2r3dyRDBak/WKloZfPjJ4I/AAAAAAAAMB0/fbUHrn28BPgSlF1ZKIMXycTB1fMrDZN_wCLcB/s400/non-specific%2Bnouns%2Band%2Bfillers%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several caveats here. Reagan was 69 when he was elected, while Bush was 64. Reagan was president for eight years and Bush for only four years; yet Bush held over twice as many press conferences as Reagan. Nonetheless, the results are consistent with a decline in cognitive function (which is not uncommon when aging from 69 to 77). Can we can classify Reagan as having MCI on the basis of these results? I don't think so. We'd really need comparable data from a population of demographically matched elderly participants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;President Donald Trump&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/16/remarks-president-trump-press-conference&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Feb. 16 press conference&lt;/a&gt;, the public debate over whether President Trump is mentally unbalanced has intensified. Much of the current and past discussion has centered on the possibility of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Narcissistic Personality Disorder&lt;/a&gt; (NPD), as speculated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/the-mind-of-donald-trump/480771/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/11/donald-trump-narcissism-therapists&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/17/donald-trump-narcisissm-mentally-ill-personality?CMP=share_btn_tw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, Trump has many of these qualities (that predate his &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; grandiose status as POTUS): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grandiosity with expectations of superior treatment from others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixated on fantasies of power, success, intelligence, attractiveness, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Self-perception of being unique, superior and associated with high-status people and institutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Needing constant admiration from others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sense of entitlement to special treatment and to obedience from others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exploitative of others to achieve personal gain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unwilling to empathize with others' feelings, wishes, or needs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intensely envious of others and the belief that others are equally envious of them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pompous and arrogant demeanor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;And we can call him &lt;b&gt;narcissistic&lt;/b&gt; in the generic sense of the word. But do we need to diagnose him with a quasi-psychiatric disorder, as in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/opinion/mental-health-professionals-warn-about-trump.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;NY Times&lt;/i&gt; letter&lt;/a&gt; signed by 35 mental health professionals?&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Mr. Trump’s speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions. His words and behavior suggest a profound inability to empathize. Individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state, attacking facts and those who convey them (journalists, scientists).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a powerful leader, these attacks are likely to increase, as his personal myth of greatness appears to be confirmed. We believe that the grave emotional instability indicated by Mr. Trump’s speech and actions makes him incapable of serving safely as president.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Allen Frances, chair of the DSM-IV task force, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/opinion/an-eminent-psychiatrist-demurs-on-trumps-mental-state.html?_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;forcefully argued&lt;/a&gt; that Trump does not meet criteria for NPD, because he is not distressed by his behavior:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Mr. Trump causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has  been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity,  self-absorption and lack of empathy. It is a stigmatizing insult to the  mentally ill (who are mostly well behaved and well meaning) to be lumped  with Mr. Trump (who is neither).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discourse Analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here I'll suggest a different approach: can we quantify age-related neurological change using spontaneous speech?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;This is probably my favorite part so far &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/n61y5I8UrN&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/n61y5I8UrN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;— Rachel Riederer (@readerer) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/readerer/status/832303185826033664&quot;&gt;February 16, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“You know what uranium is, right?  It's this &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;thing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; called nuclear weapons  and other &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Like&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, lots of &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with uranium,  including some bad &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  Nobody talks about that.  I didn't &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; anything&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for Russia.  I've &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;nothing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for Russia.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most egregious example in the one hour, 17 minute &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct0H_ndjavM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;train wreck&lt;/a&gt;. But there are other signs. He used the construction “very, very” 20 times. The word “thing” (and its variants) was uttered 102 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Am I going to diagnose him with anything? Of course not. That's unethical!&lt;/b&gt; But I will say that since Mr. Trump has been a public figure for nearly 40 years, we can objectively analyze his spontaneous speech and quantify any changes over time. I must emphasize that there is no magical scale to use for classification or comparison purposes (at least not yet). We don't know what's normal age-related decline and what's pathological.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that the best corpus of spontaneous speech data is the collection of Trump interviews/conversations with David Letterman. I believe they're unscripted, and there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-mWCMiytLi0RV53IHrGXA/search?query=donald+trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; of them on YouTube (I've linked to eight below).

The reported accuracy is an average across the 10 folds.

		<link href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/29/how-ketamine-acts-on-the-brain/"/>

		<updated>2017-09-29T15:30:23+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Ketamine is a medication mainly used for starting and maintaining anesthesia although it has also been used to provide rapid relief of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/09/02/electroshock-therapy-for-mental-illness-it-depends-on-your-genes/&quot;&gt;treatment resistant depression&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to rapidly stabilize severely depressed patients has been demonstrated in several studies and has led researchers to search for the exact mechanism by which ketamine works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort is important as ketamine is sometimes illicitly used for its &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/05/psychedelic-assisted-therapy-the-mental-health-trip-of-the-future/&quot;&gt;psychedelic properties&lt;/a&gt; and could also impede memory and other brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multiple actions of ketamine has spurred scientists to identify new drugs that would safely replicate its &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/07/is-placebo-more-powerful-than-antidepressants-and-psychotherapy/&quot;&gt;antidepressant&lt;/a&gt; response without the unwanted side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, emerging research from University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center scientists has identified a key protein that helps trigger ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects in the brain. This is a crucial step to developing alternative treatments to the controversial drug being dispensed in a growing number of clinics across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Peter O’Donnell Jr. Brain Institute have now answered a question vital to guiding future research: What proteins in the brain does ketamine target to achieve its effects?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Lisa Monteggia, Professor of Neuroscience at UT Southwestern’s O’Donnell Brain Institute states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a target in place, we can study the pathway and develop drugs that safely induce the antidepressant effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; shows that ketamine blocks a protein responsible for a range of normal brain functions. The blocking of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/07/03/rna-storage-in-neurons-contributes-to-brain-plasticity/&quot;&gt;N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor&lt;/a&gt; creates the initial antidepressant reaction, and a metabolite of ketamine is responsible for extending the duration of the effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blocking of the receptor also induces many of ketamine’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/08/04/hallucinations-vs-delusions-whats-the-difference/&quot;&gt;hallucinogenic&lt;/a&gt; responses. The drug—used for decades as an anesthetic—can distort the senses and impair coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if taken with proper medical care, ketamine may help severely depressed or &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2009/01/06/recent-drug-warnings-about-suicide/&quot;&gt;suicidal&lt;/a&gt; patients in need of a quick, effective treatment, Dr. Monteggia said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown ketamine can stabilize patients within a couple of hours, compared to other antidepressants that often take a few weeks to produce a response—if a response is induced at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As explained by Dr. Monteggia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients are demanding ketamine, and they are willing to take the risk of potential side effects just to feel better. This demand is overriding all the questions we still have about ketamine. How often can you have an infusion? How long can it last? There are a lot of aspects regarding how ketamine acts that are still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers will work to answer these questions as they plan two clinical trials with &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/28/ketamine-more-than-a-recreational-drug/&quot;&gt;ketamine&lt;/a&gt;, including an effort to administer the drug through a nasal spray as opposed to intravenous infusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of these trials will have major implications for the millions of depressed patients seeking help, in particular those who have yet to find a medication that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major national study UT Southwestern led more than a decade ago (&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2011/12/24/major-depression-in-the-real-world-the-stard-trial/&quot;&gt;STAR*D&lt;/a&gt;) yielded insight into the prevalence of the problem: Up to a third of depressed patients don’t improve upon taking their first medication, and about 40% of people who start taking antidepressants stop taking them within three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ketamine, due to the potential side effects, is mainly being explored as a treatment only after other antidepressants have failed. But for patients on the brink of giving up, waiting weeks to months to find the right &lt;a href=&quot;http://psychcentral.com/psychotherapy/&quot;&gt;therapy&lt;/a&gt; may not be an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Monteggia touches on expected future developments, where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketamine opens the door to understanding how to achieve rapid action and to stabilize people quickly. Because the (NMDA) receptor that is the target of ketamine is not involved in how other classical serotonin-based antidepressants work, our study opens up a new avenue of drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-9428&quot; height=&quot;4638&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/Figure-5.jpg&quot; width=&quot;8000&quot; /&gt;What is your profession?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an Associate Dean (Postgraduate) and Professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences  at the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland, New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What type of research are you involved in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m mostly involved in regenerative medicine involving stem cells and cell reprogramming for ocular disorders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you become interested in this area of research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally I worked in Parasitology but became interested in vision research and Ophthalmology when I moved to New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you become interested in photography?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always been interested in photography but only as an enthusiastic amateur.  When you work in biological research you do a lot of imaging and when I did my Ph.D. we had to do a lot of our own developing and printing in the darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where and how was this photo taken?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image was taken on the Otago peninsula in the South Island of New Zealand with just an everyday point and shoot digital camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why were you there at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on holiday with my family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you explain a bit more about the image?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were walking past a dishevelled boat house early in the morning and I was struck at just how many oyster catchers were congregated on the one roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about this scene particularly interested you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that there were only oyster catchers and I had only ever seen them in pairs before, this meant that I had to stop and take the photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the world, neuroscience evidence is being introduced into courtrooms at an increasing rate, including findings from behavioural genetics. Specifically, some legal teams for the defence have been allowed to argue that the defendant has a low activity version of the MAOA gene, which codes for an enzyme that regulates the levels of several neurotransmitters. In combination with experiencing child abuse or maltreatment, having this low activity gene has been linked with increased impulsivity, including aggression. Defense lawyers presumably hope that jurors will interpret this as meaning the defendant was less culpable for their violent crime. However, before now, little research has examined how jurors will treat this evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881042&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Behavioral Sciences and the Law&lt;/em&gt;, Natalie Gordon and Edie Greene presented 600 mock jurors (half were students, half were from the wider community) with a detailed trial summary based on a real US murder trial in which the defendant, already in jail for an earlier crime, had murdered his cell-mate. The jurors’ task was to decide whether he should face the death penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-30595&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jurors were presented with different versions of the trial – for example, some read that a medical geneticist had described the gene-environment interaction (that the defendant had the low activity MAOA gene and had suffered maltreatment as a child, which can lead to increased impulsivity); others read only about genetic evidence; others only heard about the environmental factor (maltreated as a child). The jurors also read about evidence from a clinical psychologist about whether the defendant was high or low risk for being dangerously violent in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the results suggested that “evidence of a genetic x environment interaction did little to reduce the likelihood of a death sentence”, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinical psychologists’ evidence was the most powerful mitigating factor. When the psychologist said the defendant was low risk, the jurors were less likely to choose the death penalty regardless of what other evidence they heard about genes, childhood, or the interaction between the two. Preference for death penalty (at 13 per cent) was lowest among jurors who heard the defendant was low risk and who heard the gene-environment evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the defendant was classified as high risk, the gene-environment interaction evidence didn’t have much of a mitigating impact – a similar proportion of jurors still proposed the death penalty compared with those who heard only about his maltreatment as a child (30 per cent vs. 34 per cent). Meanwhile, genetic evidence on its own actually led to more recommendations for the death penalty (41 per cent when he was high risk; 35 per cent when low risk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the defence might continue to use [gene-environment evidence] – wishfully according to our data – to argue that genetic and environmental factors interact to impair a defendant’s ability to control behavior, the prosecution could argue that these same factors show that the defendant has a stable, criminal disposition and poses an ongoing threat to society,” the researchers concluded. “If presented by the prosecution in this way, evidence of a G x E interaction could result in an increased likelihood of a death sentence.”&lt;/p&gt;

Kurdish forces, with the aid of months of U.S.-led coalition airstrikes, liberated the town from ISIL extremists, known in Arabic as Daesh, in recent days. Although many minority Yazidis celebrated the victory, their home city of Sinjar lay in complete ruins. Local Yazidi fighters who fought with Kurdish forces and some former residents have been taking any salvagable items out of the rubble, the town being uninhabitable and perilously close to the frontline.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are some people willing to risk their own lives – and even their children’s lives – to fight an enemy? An extraordinary study involving interviews with frontline fighters against the Islamic State, as well as IS fighters, finds that three crucial factors are at play. The most important was the strength of commitment to a “sacred” or deeply-held value or idea – but not necessarily a religious one. The findings “may help to inform policy decisions for the common defense,” wrote Ángel Gómez and his colleagues in their&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0193-3&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behaviour.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-30551&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, most analyses of why groups choose to fight have focused on relative material strength – those with greater firepower and manpower are more willing to go to battle. But the authors of the new research point out, ever since World War II, insurgent groups have prevailed with as little as a tenth of the military muscle of state forces. “One plausible reason resides in the motivations of the combatants,” the researchers noted. “When group interests become sacred and non-negotiable, spiritual considerations trump material ones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine this idea, the researchers, all associated with &lt;a href=&quot;http://artisinternational.org&quot;&gt;Artis International&lt;/a&gt;, a research institution established to explore politically motivated violence, based in Arizona, US, set up a series of studies. In 2015, members of the team travelled to northern Iraq, to interview combatants fighting against so-called Islamic State forces (IS; also known variously as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh), including fighters from the Kurdistan Worker’s Party, and they also interviewed some captured IS fighters. They also ran another field study in February and March this year on the same frontline, interviewing Peshmurga (Kurdish Regional Government forces), Iraqi army Kurds and Arab Sunni militia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on earlier research, the team identified a likely set of “sacred values” for these groups. These included “Kurdeity” (a cultural concept denoting a sense of Kurdish language, heritage and land) and, for the Sunni Arab fighters, “Arabness” (also a cultural concept). A value was deemed “sacred” if an individual indicated that no amount of material gain would persuade them to give it up. For other people, ‘democracy’ might represent a sacred value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined how willing the fighters would be to make costly sacrifices, by asking if they’d be willing to die, let their family suffer, kill civilians, undertake a suicide attack and/or torture women and children for that value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since previous studies of combat soldiers have stressed devotion to comrades over cause, the researchers also systematically explored the extent to which the fighters were willing to sacrifice members of a group that they belonged to – including their comrades and their family – to fight for their value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the researchers ran 14 online studies with more than 6,600 non-combatants from various regions of Spain, a country that has experienced recent IS terror attacks, to explore whether civilians may have similar attitudes. “Strikingly, the frontline and online studies converge on key determinants of willingness to make costly sacrifices,” the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across groups, the three critical factors underlying people’s willingness to make sacrifices to fight for a cause were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having a commitment to non-negotiable sacred values and to groups that individuals were ‘wholly fused with’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a readiness to forsake kin for those values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a perception that the spiritual strength of the in-group versus the foe is more important than relative military might&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half of the fighters, when asked what was most important to them, stated at least one sacred value, such as “Arabness”, as being more important than their comrades or even their family.  This was generally not the case for the non-combatants from Spain (more than 77 per cent of whom said their family was more important to them than their most important “sacred value”). However, like the fighters, those minority of civilians who said a sacred value or values was more important to them than the groups they belonged to reported being more willing to make costly sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some anti-IS fighters, the sacrifices they made in prioritising their values over their family were horrific. “In some cases, ISIS has divulged children’s public executions for parents who opposed the Caliphate and its leader,” the researchers wrote. These choices were very difficult: “Indeed, frontline fighters would be highly emotional when discussing making such tragic choices.” But they still made them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results from both the frontline and the online studies also found that when it came to a willingness to make sacrifices, participants were less interested in the military might of an opponent than in the concept of “spiritual formidability”. Avowedly religious ISIS fighters and avowedly secular PKK fighters (the only force that held fast against the ISIS onslaught in summer 2014) alike firmly disregarded a consideration of their foe’s manpower and firepower, relative to their own, if they believed they had the upper hand in spiritual terms. The Kurdish fighters, for example, stated that what was important was “&lt;i&gt;ruhi bi ghiyrat”&lt;/i&gt; – “spirituality with bravery”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other studies – of opponents of the Gadaffi regime in Libya, for example, as well as of soldiers in the West – have concluded that a deep commitment to comrades is key to an individual’s fighting spirit. This study finds that commitment to a value “can trump group loyalty in willingness to fight”. As such, the researchers hope their findings will help policymakers wrangling with how best to deal with the threat posed by groups like IS. They add that an important subject for further study is why some groups are better able to inspire loyalty to an abstract cause than others.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/27/ketamine-for-rapid-treatment-of-depression/"/>

		<updated>2017-09-27T15:30:01+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A team of researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently discovered why the drug ketamine may act as a rapid antidepressant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ketamine is best known as an illicit, psychedelic club drug. Often referred to as “Special K” or a “horse tranquilizer” by the media, it has been around since the 1960s and is a staple anesthetic in emergency rooms and burn centers. In the last 10 years, studies have shown that it can reverse — sometimes within hours or even minutes — the kind of severe, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/10/back-to-school-suicides/&quot;&gt;suicidal depression&lt;/a&gt; that traditional antidepressants can’t treat.&lt;span id=&quot;more-100331&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers writing in the August 2010 issue of &lt;a href=&quot;http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=210856&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Archives of General Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that people in a small study who had treatment-resistant &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2010/09/01/when-bipolar-patients-abuse-drugs-the-dual-diagnosis-dilemma/&quot;&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt; experienced relief from &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/08/new-target-in-brain-for-treating-depression-the-bmp-pathway/&quot;&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; symptoms in as little as 40 minutes after getting an intravenous dose of ketamine. Eighteen of these people had previously been unsuccessfully treated with at least one antidepressant medication and a mood stabilizer; the average number of medications they had tried unsuccessfully was seven. Within 40 minutes, 9 of 16 (56 percent) of the participants receiving ketamine had at least a 50 percent reduction in symptoms, and 2 of 16 (13 percent) had full remission and became symptom-free. The response lasted an average of about a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a small 2006 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/science-news/2006/experimental-medication-kicks-depression-in-hours-instead-of-weeks.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NIMH study&lt;/a&gt;, one of the first to look at ketamine for depression, 18 treatment-resistant, depressed (unipolar) patients were randomly selected to receive either a single intravenous dose of ketamine or a placebo. Depression symptoms improved within one day in 71 percent of those who were given ketamine, and 29 percent of the patients became nearly symptom-free in a day. Thirty-five percent of patients who received ketamine still showed benefits seven days later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the most recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v533/n7604/abs/nature17998.html&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published online in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in May 2016, researchers discovered that a chemical byproduct, or metabolite, is created as the body breaks down ketamine. The metabolite reversed depression-like behaviors in mice without triggering any of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/28/ketamine-more-than-a-recreational-drug/&quot;&gt;anesthetic&lt;/a&gt;, dissociative, or addictive side effects associated with ketamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As put by Carlos Zarate, MD, of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), and a study coauthor and pioneer of research using ketamine to treat depression:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery fundamentally changes our understanding of how this rapid antidepressant mechanism works, and holds promise for development of more robust and safer treatments. By using a team approach, researchers were able to reverse-engineer ketamine’s workings from the clinic to the lab to pinpoint what makes it so unique.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; report, Sara Solovitch of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/a-one-time-party-drug-is-helping-people-with-deep-depression/2016/02/01/d3e73862-b490-11e5-a76a-0b5145e8679a_story.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; wrote that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;experts are calling [ketamine] the most significant advance in mental health in more than half a century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She reported that many academic medical centers, including Yale University, the University of California in San Diego, the Mayo Clinic, and the Cleveland Clinic, have all begun offering ketamine treatments off-label for severe depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all sounds too good to be true, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Drawbacks of Ketamine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The predominant drawback of ketamine is the lack of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There haven’t been enough clinical trials on the drug to assure its safety, and there’s a lack of information on the long-term effects of its use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ketamine’s effects are also short-lived. To be used as an effective antidepressant, it would need to be administered regularly, which leads to concerns about addiction, tolerance, and, again, long-term effects. The data that we do have on long-term use comes from people who have taken ketamine recreationally, as well as those who have used it to treat chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One 2014 &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bcp.12094/abstract&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology&lt;/em&gt; included among possible side effects, psychedelic symptoms (hallucinations and panic attacks), nausea, cardiovascular stimulation, memory defects, and bladder and renal complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the drug holds promise for uncovering new ways of treating depression and offers hope for the most severe and complicated &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2006/07/24/articles-comparing-mood-disorders/&quot;&gt;mood disorders&lt;/a&gt; that baffle psychiatrists today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard J. Hodes, MD, director of the National Institute on Aging, commented on the most recent NIH study and the importance of furthering the research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unraveling the mechanism mediating ketamine’s antidepressant activity is an important step in the process of drug development. New approaches are critical for the treatment of depression, especially for older adults and for patients who do not respond to current medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;After reviewing nearly 20 years of retractions from researchers based in China, researchers came up with some somewhat unsurprising (yet still disheartening) findings: The number of retractions has increased (from zero in 1997 to more than 150 in 2016), and approximately 75% were due to some kind of misconduct. (You can read more details in […]&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://romainbrette.fr/the-substrate-of-consciousness/"/>

		<updated>2017-09-27T10:41:07+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="fr-FR">
 &lt;p&gt;Here I want to stir some ideas about the substrate of consciousness. Let us start with a few intuitive ideas: a human brain is conscious; an animal brain is probably conscious; a stone is not conscious; my stomach is not conscious; a single neuron or cell is not conscious; the brainstem or the visual cortex is not a separate conscious entity; two people do not form a single conscious entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these ideas are in fact difficult to justify. Let us start with single cells. To see the problem, think first of organisms that consist of a single cell. For example, bacteria, or ciliates. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvOz4V699gk&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;, an amoeba’s engulfs and then digests two paramecia. At some point, you can see the paramecia jumping all around as if they were panicking. Are these paramecia conscious, do they feel anything? If I did not know anything about their physiology or size, my first intuition would be that they do feel something close to fear. However, knowing that these are unicellular organisms and therefore do not have a nervous system, my intuition is rather that they are not actually conscious. But why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we think a nervous system is necessary for consciousness? One reason is that organisms to which we ascribe consciousness (humans and animals, or at least some animals) all have a nervous system. But it’s a circular argument, which has no logical validity. A more convincing reason is that in humans, the brain is necessary and sufficient for consciousness. A locked-in patient is still conscious. On the other hand, any large brain lesion has an impact on conscious experience, and specific experiences can be induced by electrical stimulation of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this tends to prove that the brain is the substrate of my experience, but it says nothing about, say, the stomach. The stomach also has a nervous system, it receives sensory signals and controls muscles. If it were conscious, I could not experience it, by definition, since you can only experience your own consciousness. So it could also be, just as for the brain, that the stomach is sufficient and necessary for consciousness of the gut mind: perhaps if you stimulate it electrically, it triggers some specific experience. As ridiculous as it might sound, I cannot discard the idea that the stomach is conscious just because I don’t feel that it’s conscious; I will need arguments of a different kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I am conscious, but I do not know whether there are other conscious entities in my body. Unfortunately, this applies not just to the stomach, but more generally to any other component of my body, whether it has a nervous system or not. What tells me that the liver is not conscious? Imagine I am a conscious liver. From my perspective, removing one lung, or a foot, or a large part of the visual cortex, has no effect on my conscious experience. So the fact that the brain is necessary and sufficient for your conscious experience doesn’t rule out the fact that some other substrate is necessary and sufficient for the conscious experience of another entity in your body. Now I am not saying that the question of liver consciousness is undecidable, only that we will need more subtle arguments than those exposed so far (discussed later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us come back to the single cell. Although I feel that a unicellular organism is not conscious because it doesn’t have a nervous system, so far I have no valid argument for this intuition. In addition, it turns out that Paramecium, as many other unicellular organism including (at least some) bacteria, is an excitable cell with voltage-gated channels, structurally very similar to a neuron. So perhaps it has some limited form of consciousness after all. If this is true, then I would be inclined to say that all unicellular organisms are also conscious, for example bacteria. But then what about a single cell (eg a neuron) in your body, is it conscious? One might object that a single cell in a multicellular organism is not an autonomous organism. To address this objection, I will go one level below the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eukaryotic cells (eg your cells) have little energy factories called mitochondria. It turns out that mitochondria are in fact bacteria which have been engulfed in cells a very long (evolutionary) time ago. They have their own DNA, but they now live and reproduce inside cells. This is a case of endosymbiosis. If mitochondria were conscious before they lived in cells, why would they have lost consciousness when they started living in cells? So if we think bacteria are conscious, then we must admit that we have trillions of conscious entities in the cells of our body – not counting the bacteria in our digestive system. The concept of an autonomous organism is an illusion: any living organism depends on interactions with an ecosystem, and that ecosystem might well be a cell or a multicellular organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the same argument, if we think unicellular organisms are conscious, then single neurons should be conscious, as well as all single cells in our body. This is not exclusive of the brain being conscious as a distinct entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plausible alternative, of course, is that single cells are not conscious, although I have not yet proposed a good argument for this alternative. Before we turn to a new question, I will let you contemplate the fact that bacteria can form populations that are tightly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v527/n7576/full/nature15709.html&quot;&gt;coupled by electrical communication&lt;/a&gt;. Does this make a bacteria colony conscious?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us now turn to another question. We can imagine that a cell is somehow minimally conscious, and that at the same time a brain forms a conscious entity of a different nature. Of course it might not be true, but there is a case for that argument. So now let us consider two people living their own life on opposite sides of the planet. Can this pair form a new conscious entity? Here, there are arguments to answer negatively. This is related to a concept called the &lt;em&gt;unity of consciousness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose I see a red book. In the brain, some areas might respond to the color and some other areas might respond to the shape. It could be then that the color area experiences redness, and the shape area experience bookness. But I, as a single conscious unit, experiences a red book as a whole. Now if we consider two entities that do not interact, then there cannot be united experiences: somehow the redness and the bookness must be put together. So the substrate of a conscious entity cannot be made of parts that do not interact with the rest. Two separated people cannot form a conscious entity. But this does not rule out the possibility that two closely interacting people may not form a conscious superentity. Again, I do not believe this is the case, but we need to find new arguments to rule this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we finally have something a little substantial: a conscious entity must be made of components in interaction. From this idea follow a few remarks. First, consciousness is not a property of a substrate, but of the activity of a substrate (see a &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/neural-correlates-of-perception-whats-wrong-with-them/&quot;&gt;previous blog post on this idea&lt;/a&gt;). For example, if we freeze the brain in a particular state, it is not conscious. This rules out a number of inanimate objects (rocks) as conscious. Second, interactions take place in time. For example, it takes some time, up to a few tens of ms, for an action potential to travel from one neuron to another. This implies that a 1 ms time window cannot enclose a conscious experience. The “grain” of consciousness for a human brain should thus be no less than a few tens of milliseconds. In the same way, if a plant is conscious, then that consciousness cannot exist on a short timescale. This puts a constraint on the kind of experiences that can be ascribed to a particular substrate. Does consciousness require a nervous system? Maybe it doesn’t, but at least for large organisms, a nervous system is required to produce experiences on a short timescale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to end with a final question. We are asking what kind of substrate gives rise to consciousness. But does consciousness require a fixed substrate? After all, the brain is dynamic. Synapses appear and disappear all the time, all the proteins get renewed regularly. The brain is literally a different set of molecules and a different structure from one day to the next. But the conscious entity remains. Or at least it seems so. This is what Buddhists call the illusion of self: contrary to your intuition, you are not the same person today and ten years ago; the self has no objective permanent existence. However, we can say that there is a continuity in conscious experience. That continuity, however, does not rely on a fixed material basis but more likely on some continuity of the underlying activity. Imagine for example a fictional worm that is conscious, but the substrate of consciousness is local. At some point it is produced by the interaction of neurons at some particular place of the nervous system, then that activity travels along the worm’s spine. The conscious entity remains and doesn’t feel like it’s travelling, it is simply grounded on a dynamic substrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I don’t think that this is true of the brain (or of the worm), but rather that long-range synchronization has something to do with the generation of a global conscious entity. However, it is conceivable that different subsets of neurons, even though they might span the same global brain areas, are involved in conscious experience at different times. In fact, this is even plausible. Most neurons don’t fire much, perhaps a few Hz on average. But one can definitely have a definite conscious experience over a fraction of second, and that experience thus can only involve the interaction of a subset of all neurons. We must conclude that the substrate of consciousness is actually not fixed but involve dynamic sets of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A summary of these remarks. I certainly have raised more questions than I have answered. In particular, it is not clear whether a single cell or a component of the nervous system (stomach, brainstem) is conscious. However, I have argued that: 1) any conscious experience requires the interaction of the components that produce it, and this interaction takes place in time; 2) the set of components that are involved in any particular experience is dynamic, despite the continuity in conscious experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Cast your mind back to your teenage maths lessons. Without a calculator, would you have been able to estimate the answer to the following sum?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; 12/13 + 7/8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry about giving the precise number; just say whether it lies closest to 1, 2, 19, or 21*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of middle school, most American pupils have been studying fractions for a few years; these questions should be embarrassingly easy. But when Robert Siegler, a psychologist at Carnegie Mellon University posed the problem to a group of 8th graders (13 to 14 year olds), he found that they performed little better than if they’d simply guessed – with just 27 per cent choosing the right answer. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2010/June/june24_mathematicsresearch.shtml&quot;&gt;another test&lt;/a&gt;, around 50 per cent of 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; graders failed the arguably easier task of putting a series of simple fractions into size order, from smallest to biggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if this dismal performance wasn’t depressing enough, it comes after decades of educational reforms. American educational psychologists &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~siegler/2015-LF-etal.pdf&quot;&gt;first identified that teens often struggled to understand fractions in 1978&lt;/a&gt;, and since then various government commissions and teacher committees have attempted to address the issue, including thousands of educational studies and the introduction of widely used textbooks aimed specifically at deepening children’s understanding of fractions and decimals. These efforts may have amounted to billions of dollars’ worth of spending. Yet Siegler found next-to-no improvement in performance over the 40-year period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, students from other cultures – most notably, East Asian countries – do not face these problems. Siegler and his colleague Hugues Lortie-Forgues have explored the various potential explanations in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1177%25252F0963721417700129&quot;&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Current Directions in Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, including research that hints at a tantalizing link between language and mathematical reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they point out, a basic understanding of fractions and decimals is essential for any further mathematical or science education – so finding a way to remove this stumbling block could have serious consequences for the pupils’ future careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-30421&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair first looked at the “inherent” sources of difficulty in these kind of fraction problems – the cognitive hurdles that every child must pass to arrive at the correct answer. The absolute size of the numerators and denominators in a fraction can be intuitively misleading. For example it takes some time and brainpower to work out that 5/11 is smaller than 2/3, since we need to discount the fact that 5 is bigger than 2, and 11 bigger than 3. As a result, even estimating the rough magnitude of a fraction becomes a burden, and that, in turn, could prevent you from checking whether your calculations are on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s no getting away from the fact that the rules of fraction arithmetic can be a headache – you need to remember to convert the numbers to a common denominator when adding or subtracting, but not when multiplying, for instance. (1/3 + 1/2 becomes 2/6 + 3/6 = 5/6, for instance.) As an adult these may not seem like huge cognitive leaps, but as a child the reasons can seem opaque and confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet children in other cultures do not stumble over these hurdles – suggesting that the inherent sources of difficulty cannot be the whole explanation for why US kids struggle so much. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096514001568?via%25253Dihub&quot;&gt;One study from 2015&lt;/a&gt; compared the performance of 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; graders in the US and China on a test of fraction arithmetic. By the 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade, the Chinese students already reached about 90 per cent accuracy, compared to 32 per cent in the US. Even after two extra years of education, the US students only scored 60 per cent, lagging considerably behind the Chinese. (The same is apparently true for many East Asian cultures, including Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, Siegler and Lortie-Forgues also examined the “culturally-contingent sources of difficulty” – which, to my mind, are far more revealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possibility is that US teachers simply aren’t as good at maths as teachers in other countries, with various studies suggesting that the majority struggle with a conceptual understanding of fractions in particular. For instance, Siegler found that a majority of trainee teachers incorrectly predicted that multiplying two fractions less than one would result in an answer greater than one. Chinese, teachers, by contrast, are less likely to make these mistakes. Nor will the students find the right answers in their textbooks: Siegler and Lortie-Forgues argue that US maths books offer fewer examples and questions for students to practice – particularly on the trickier concepts, like division – compared to sample texts from East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most intriguing explanation involves the language we speak. East Asian languages phrase fractions in a more literal way: the Korean term for 1/3, &lt;i&gt;sam bun ui il&lt;/i&gt;, translates as “of three parts, one” – compared to the English “one third”. This small difference means that even very young Korean children, in the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; grade ( 5-7 year olds), can intuitively match a fraction to a picture – immediately elevating their mathematical understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these different factors may contribute to a kind of vicious cycle in the North American educational system. Students struggle to understand the basic mathematical concepts, and then, if they become teachers, they are less well-equipped to cultivate the necessary thinking in the next generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a British perspective, I’d have been interested to read more about the cultural differences in the West. How do British and European schools compare to the US and East Asian schools? My guess (based on my own education) is that our students would certainly share some – if not all – of the difficulties faced by the American children. If nothing else, our shared language could be one barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question, of course, is whether psychology can suggest ways to cultivate a deeper understanding of mathematics. There is some hope that it might: for instance, one study found that simply changing the way we label fractions in English – so that it is closer to the Korean phrasing “of three parts, one” – seems to boost American children’s understanding. But in general, strong evidence for effective interventions is so far lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may change soon. Siegler and Lortie-Forgues say they are planning to test a new method that will attempt to build the children’s understand on stronger foundations, filling in many of the conceptual gaps that the students (and teachers) are currently missing. Will they succeed, where so many other initiatives have failed? Watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 Imaging and chromosome conformation capture studies have revealed several layers of chromosome organization, including segregation into megabase-large active and inactive compartments, and partitioning into sub-megabase domains (TADs). Yet, it remains unclear how these layers of organization form, interact with one another and impact genome functions. Here, we show that deletion of the cohesin-loading factor Nipbl, in mouse liver, leads to a dramatic reorganization of chromosomal folding. TADs and associated peaks vanish globally, even in the absence of transcriptional changes. In contrast, compartmental segregation is preserved and even reinforced. Strikingly, the disappearance of TADs unmasks a finer compartment structure that accurately reflects the underlying epigenetic landscape. These observations demonstrate that the 3D organization of the genome results from the interplay of two independent mechanisms: 1) cohesin-independent segregation of the genome into fine-scale compartments, defined by chromatin state; and 2) cohesin-dependent formation of TADs, possibly by loop extrusion, which contributes to guide distant enhancers to their target genes.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Under homeostatic conditions, animals use well-defined hypothalamic neural circuits to help maintain stable body weight, by integrating metabolic and hormonal signals from the periphery to balance food consumption and energy expenditure. In stressed or disease conditions, however, animals use alternative neuronal pathways to adapt to the metabolic challenges of altered energy demand. Recent studies have identified brain areas outside the hypothalamus that are activated under these ‘non-homeostatic’ conditions, but the molecular nature of the peripheral signals and brain-localized receptors that activate these circuits remains elusive. Here we identify glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) receptor alpha-like (GFRAL) as a brainstem-restricted receptor for growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). GDF15 regulates food intake, energy expenditure and body weight in response to metabolic and toxin-induced stresses; we show that Gfral knockout mice are hyperphagic under stressed conditions and are resistant to chemotherapy-induced anorexia and body weight loss. GDF15 activates GFRAL-expressing neurons localized exclusively in the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius of the mouse brainstem. It then triggers the activation of neurons localized within the parabrachial nucleus and central amygdala, which constitute part of the ‘emergency circuit’ that shapes feeding responses to stressful conditions. GDF15 levels increase in response to tissue stress and injury, and elevated levels are associated with body weight loss in numerous chronic human diseases. By isolating GFRAL as the receptor for GDF15-induced anorexia and weight loss, we identify a mechanistic basis for the non-homeostatic regulation of neural circuitry by a peripheral signal associated with tissue damage and stress. These findings provide opportunities to develop therapeutic agents for the treatment of disorders with altered energy demand.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Targeted BRAF inhibition (BRAFi) and combined BRAF and MEK inhibition (BRAFi and MEKi) therapies have markedly improved the clinical outcomes of patients with metastatic melanoma. Unfortunately, the efficacy of these treatments is often countered by the acquisition of drug resistance. Here we investigated the molecular mechanisms that underlie acquired resistance to BRAFi and to the combined therapy. Consistent with previous studies, we show that resistance to BRAFi is mediated by ERK pathway reactivation. Resistance to the combined therapy, however, is mediated by mechanisms independent of reactivation of ERK in many resistant cell lines and clinical samples. p21-activated kinases (PAKs) become activated in cells with acquired drug resistance and have a pivotal role in mediating resistance. Our screening, using a reverse-phase protein array, revealed distinct mechanisms by which PAKs mediate resistance to BRAFi and the combined therapy. In BRAFi-resistant cells, PAKs phosphorylate CRAF and MEK to reactivate ERK. In cells that are resistant to the combined therapy, PAKs regulate JNK and β-catenin phosphorylation and mTOR pathway activation, and inhibit apoptosis, thereby bypassing ERK. Together, our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired drug resistance to current targeted therapies, and may help to direct novel drug development efforts to overcome acquired drug resistance.

		<link href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/kEd8ytbENaU/nature24039"/>
		<id>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24039</id>

 &lt;p&gt;
 Vertebrate genomes exhibit marked CG suppression—that is, lower than expected numbers of 5′-CG-3′ dinucleotides. This feature is likely to be due to C-to-T mutations that have accumulated over hundreds of millions of years, driven by CG-specific DNA methyl transferases and spontaneous methyl-cytosine deamination. Many RNA viruses of vertebrates that are not substrates for DNA methyl transferases mimic the CG suppression of their hosts. This property of viral genomes is unexplained. Here we show, using synonymous mutagenesis, that CG suppression is essential for HIV-1 replication. The deleterious effect of CG dinucleotides on HIV-1 replication was cumulative, associated with cytoplasmic RNA depletion, and was exerted by CG dinucleotides in both translated and non-translated exonic RNA sequences. A focused screen using small inhibitory RNAs revealed that zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) inhibited virion production by cells infected with CG-enriched HIV-1. Crucially, HIV-1 mutants containing segments whose CG content mimicked random nucleotide sequence were defective in unmanipulated cells, but replicated normally in ZAP-deficient cells. Crosslinking–immunoprecipitation–sequencing assays demonstrated that ZAP binds directly and selectively to RNA sequences containing CG dinucleotides. These findings suggest that ZAP exploits host CG suppression to identify non-self RNA. The dinucleotide composition of HIV-1, and perhaps other RNA viruses, appears to have adapted to evade this host defence.

 &lt;p&gt;
 The dynamic and reversible acetylation of proteins, catalysed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), is a major epigenetic regulatory mechanism of gene transcription and is associated with multiple diseases. Histone deacetylase inhibitors are currently approved to treat certain cancers, but progress on the development of drug-like histone actyltransferase inhibitors has lagged behind. The histone acetyltransferase paralogues p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) are key transcriptional co-activators that are essential for a multitude of cellular processes, and have also been implicated in human pathological conditions (including cancer). Current inhibitors of the p300 and CBP histone acetyltransferase domains, including natural products, bi-substrate analogues and the widely used small molecule C646, lack potency or selectivity. Here, we describe A-485, a potent, selective and drug-like catalytic inhibitor of p300 and CBP. We present a high resolution (1.95 Å) co-crystal structure of a small molecule bound to the catalytic active site of p300 and demonstrate that A-485 competes with acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). A-485 selectively inhibited proliferation in lineage-specific tumour types, including several haematological malignancies and androgen receptor-positive prostate cancer. A-485 inhibited the androgen receptor transcriptional program in both androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer and inhibited tumour growth in a castration-resistant xenograft model. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using small molecule inhibitors to selectively target the catalytic activity of histone acetyltransferases, which may provide effective treatments for transcriptional activator-driven malignancies and diseases.

 The ability to directly uncover the contributions of genes to a given phenotype is fundamental for biology research. However, ostensibly homogeneous cell populations exhibit large clonal variance that can confound analyses and undermine reproducibility. Here we used genome-saturated mutagenesis to create a biobank of over 100,000 individual haploid mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell lines targeting 16,970 genes with genetically barcoded, conditional and reversible mutations. This Haplobank is, to our knowledge, the largest resource of hemi/homozygous mutant mES cells to date and is available to all researchers. Reversible mutagenesis overcomes clonal variance by permitting functional annotation of the genome directly in sister cells. We use the Haplobank in reverse genetic screens to investigate the temporal resolution of essential genes in mES cells, and to identify novel genes that control sprouting angiogenesis and lineage specification of blood vessels. Furthermore, a genome-wide forward screen with Haplobank identified PLA2G16 as a host factor that is required for cytotoxicity by rhinoviruses, which cause the common cold. Therefore, clones from the Haplobank combined with the use of reversible technologies enable high-throughput, reproducible, functional annotation of the genome.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Catecholamine-induced lipolysis, the first step in the generation of energy substrates by the hydrolysis of triglycerides, declines with age. The defect in the mobilization of free fatty acids in the elderly is accompanied by increased visceral adiposity, lower exercise capacity, failure to maintain core body temperature during cold stress, and reduced ability to survive starvation. Although catecholamine signalling in adipocytes is normal in the elderly, how lipolysis is impaired in ageing remains unknown. Here we show that adipose tissue macrophages regulate the age-related reduction in adipocyte lipolysis in mice by lowering the bioavailability of noradrenaline. Unexpectedly, unbiased whole-transcriptome analyses of adipose macrophages revealed that ageing upregulates genes that control catecholamine degradation in an NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent manner. Deletion of NLRP3 in ageing restored catecholamine-induced lipolysis by downregulating growth differentiation factor-3 (GDF3) and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) that is known to degrade noradrenaline. Consistent with this, deletion of GDF3 in inflammasome-activated macrophages improved lipolysis by decreasing levels of MAOA and caspase-1. Furthermore, inhibition of MAOA reversed the age-related reduction in noradrenaline concentration in adipose tissue, and restored lipolysis with increased levels of the key lipolytic enzymes adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). Our study reveals that targeting neuro-immunometabolic signalling between the sympathetic nervous system and macrophages may offer new approaches to mitigate chronic inflammation-induced metabolic impairment and functional decline.

 &lt;p&gt;
 The vestiges of life in Eoarchean rocks have the potential to elucidate the origin of life. However, gathering evidence from many terrains is not always possible, and biogenic graphite has thus far been found only in the 3.7–3.8 Ga (gigayears ago) Isua supracrustal belt. Here we present the total organic carbon contents and carbon isotope values of graphite (δ13Corg) and carbonate (δ13Ccarb) in the oldest metasedimentary rocks from northern Labrador. Some pelitic rocks have low δ13Corg values of −28.2, comparable to the lowest value in younger rocks. The consistency between crystallization temperatures of the graphite and metamorphic temperature of the host rocks establishes that the graphite does not originate from later contamination. A clear correlation between the δ13Corg values and metamorphic grade indicates that variations in the δ13Corg values are due to metamorphism, and that the pre-metamorphic value was lower than the minimum value. We concluded that the large fractionation between the δ13Ccarb and δ13Corg values, up to 25‰, indicates the oldest evidence of organisms greater than 3.95 Ga. The discovery of the biogenic graphite enables geochemical study of the biogenic materials themselves, and will provide insight into early life not only on Earth but also on other planets.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Homeostatic signalling systems ensure stable but flexible neural activity and animal behaviour. Presynaptic homeostatic plasticity is a conserved form of neuronal homeostatic signalling that is observed in organisms ranging from Drosophila to human. Defining the underlying molecular mechanisms of neuronal homeostatic signalling will be essential in order to establish clear connections to the causes and progression of neurological disease. During neural development, semaphorin–plexin signalling instructs axon guidance and neuronal morphogenesis. However, semaphorins and plexins are also expressed in the adult brain. Here we show that semaphorin 2b (Sema2b) is a target-derived signal that acts upon presynaptic plexin B (PlexB) receptors to mediate the retrograde, homeostatic control of presynaptic neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction in Drosophila. Further, we show that Sema2b–PlexB signalling regulates presynaptic homeostatic plasticity through the cytoplasmic protein Mical and the oxoreductase-dependent control of presynaptic actin. We propose that semaphorin–plexin signalling is an essential platform for the stabilization of synaptic transmission throughout the developing and mature nervous system. These findings may be relevant to the aetiology and treatment of diverse neurological and psychiatric diseases that are characterized by altered or inappropriate neural function and behaviour.

 &lt;p&gt;
 De novo protein design holds promise for creating small stable proteins with shapes customized to bind therapeutic targets. We describe a massively parallel approach for designing, manufacturing and screening mini-protein binders, integrating large-scale computational design, oligonucleotide synthesis, yeast display screening and next-generation sequencing. We designed and tested 22,660 mini-proteins of 37–43 residues that target influenza haemagglutinin and botulinum neurotoxin B, along with 6,286 control sequences to probe contributions to folding and binding, and identified 2,618 high-affinity binders. Comparison of the binding and non-binding design sets, which are two orders of magnitude larger than any previously investigated, enabled the evaluation and improvement of the computational model. Biophysical characterization of a subset of the binder designs showed that they are extremely stable and, unlike antibodies, do not lose activity after exposure to high temperatures. The designs elicit little or no immune response and provide potent prophylactic and therapeutic protection against influenza, even after extensive repeated dosing.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/animal-1850235_960_720-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cetaceans are aquatic mammals comprising whales, porpoises, and dolphins. Field evidence has shown that cetacean populations live in large complex groups, experiencing varied relationships. As they function with alliances and orders, like we have in our human societies, they communicate and collaborate in groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These animals are considered to have a relatively large brain size relative to body size, assumed to relate to their high intelligence. Cetaceans and primates are among the mammals with the highest intelligence, which is thought to be due to an evolutionary expansion of brain size, driven primarily by the seven primary microcephaly (MCPH) genes. This change could relate to the increasingly complex social demands of a group living environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, and whether this hypothesis is justified at the molecular level in cetaceans, researchers from Nanjing Normal University in China set out to investigate the genetic basis of cetacean brain size development. In this &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-1051-7&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; led by Dr Shixia Xu and her colleagues, the team analysed seven loci of MCPH genes which affect brain size development in cetaceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MCPH genes are known to be associated with neurodevelopment disorders in humans, as they play a key role in brain development. Other protein regulators such as CEP152 play a part in cell division and brain development. MCPH in particular has been thought to be responsible for the increase in brain size in mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-9514 alignright&quot; height=&quot;188&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/dna-1388692_960_720-300x169.jpg&quot; width=&quot;334&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors looked for evidence of MCPH genes that had been under positive selection during cetacean evolution. They found a connection between increasing encephalization quotient (EQ – a measure of relative brain size) and the MCPH genes comprising ASPM and CDK5RAP2, suggesting these genes may have played a role in the brain size expansion of cetaceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out whether social complexity was a driving force in the expansion of cetacean brain size, the researchers used pre-existing research from thirteen cetacean species, to determine mean group size and social complexity. This data was compared with identified locations of positively selected sites in 3D visualised structures of the MCPH genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using methods for statistical analysis, the researchers found a strong link between the rate of evolutionary change in a genotype and mean group size for ASPM and CDK5RAP2 genes. This helped indicate that cetaceans evolved these larger brains to deal with increasingly complex social environments, supporting  the ‘social brain hypothesis’ – the idea that species living in complex social environments must evolve larger brains to process complex information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research supports the idea that cetaceans evolved a larger brain size relative to body size, due to an increasing need for intelligence to cope with their increasingly complex social groups. The authors suggest that further investigations into the ‘social brain hypothesis’ could involve the investigation of other ecological factors such as behaviour and feeding, in relation to the MCPH gene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, more and more of our children are learning mindfulness at school. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://mindfulnessinschools.org&quot;&gt;Mindfulness in Schools&lt;/a&gt; project claims that over 4000 of our teachers are now trained in the practice. However, some experts are concerned that the roll-out of mindfulness has raced ahead of the evidence base, which paints a mixed picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796716300389&quot;&gt;recent failure&lt;/a&gt; to find any benefits of a school mindfulness programme for teenagers (contrary to some earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23787061&quot;&gt;more positive findings&lt;/a&gt;), a research team led by Catherine Johnson at Flinders University has now &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000579671730181X&quot;&gt;reported in &lt;em&gt;Behaviour Research and Therapy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the results of their latest school trial, which included new features in the mindfulness intervention, such as parental involvement and better designed homework materials, intended to maximise the programme’s effectiveness. However, once again the mindfulness programme led to no observable benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-30003&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nine-week Mindfulness Programme used in the current trial was based on the popular &lt;em&gt;.b&lt;/em&gt; Mindfulness in School’s curriculum, which features various elements, including: the eponymous “stop and be” (.b) technique that involves stopping, feeling your feet, feeling your breathing and being present; training in how to be more mindful in everyday activities; and relaxation practices. Daily practice at home was encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three hundred and seventy-eight teenagers from four urban schools in Australia were allocated to take part in the weekly 40- to 60-minute training sessions. About half of this group took part in a version of the programme that actively involved their parents, through an initial parents’ evening session and the receipt of weekly Youtube clips of their child’s training sessions. Another 182 teens from the same schools acted as controls and did not participate in any of the mindfulness classes. The average age of the participating pupils was 13 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with earlier trials, the mindfulness programme included additional elements designed to maximise engagement and the chances for the programme being a success. This included asking teachers to participate alongside their pupils, providing teachers with audio files for practising techniques with their pupils outside of the formal sessions, and improved course materials such as colourful classroom posters and quizzes. The mindfulness training was delivered by the trial’s lead author who is a highly experienced mindfulness practitioner and trainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participating pupils completed a wide range of psychological measures at baseline, after the nine-week programme was complete, and again at six- and 12-month follow up, including questionnaires tapping their levels of anxiety and depression, their concerns with their weight, their overall wellbeing, and their levels of everyday mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants who completed the mindfulness programme showed no benefits on any measure, either immediately or after the programme or at follow-up. It made no difference whether they were in the version of the programme that included parental engagement (participation by parents was extremely poor – only 8 per cent attended the initial evening session – prompting the researchers to suggest this approach may be a poor use of resources).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results may not surprise readers who are sceptical of all the hype around mindfulness. The researchers, who are mindfulness enthusiasts, wonder if perhaps the early teen years are not the optimum time to teach mindfulness. “Despite the added capacity [compared with younger kids] for abstract thought to allow skills such as metacognition to unfold, perhaps more ‘cynical’ early adolescents require increased life challenges before the relevance of socioemotional tools becomes evident,” they said, adding: “Further research is required to identify the optimal age, content and length of programs delivering mindfulness to adolescents”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/show/nutrient-activated-tor-proteins-regulate-cell-growth/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was given to Michael N. Hall for discovery of and investigations into “nutrient-activated TOR proteins and their central role in the metabolic control of cell growth.” TOR (Target of Rapamycin) is a highly conserved protein and a central regulator through its role as a nutrient sensor, coupling nutrient availability to protein synthesis and cell growth. A critical signaling protein, TOR forms multiprotein associations that function as distinct clusters, either as TORC1 (TOR Complex 1) or TORC2 (TOR Complex 2), depending upon those additional proteins. In their 2007 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; article, Hall and colleagues &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001217&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;identified novel TOR interacting proteins specific for each complex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, investigating the role of phosphorylation and complex function for each. More recently, work from the Hall group published in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; demonstrated a role for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004145&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TORC1 in bone formation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and, in yeast cells, characterized the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0120250&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;signaling state of the TORC1 complex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with the use of antibody tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/show/hpv-vaccines-cancer-prevention/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lasker~DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was jointly awarded to John Schiller and Douglas Lowy for their collaborative efforts, innovations and ”technological advances that enabled development of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines for prevention of cervical cancer and other tumors caused by human papillomaviruses.” Papillomavirus infection on the skin and mucous membranes of humans and animals can cause benign warts (papillomas) or malignancies, especially anogenital carcinomas, and in genetically predisposed or immunocompromised individuals can cause skin cancer. Development of safe and effective vaccines has potential to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer and other malignancies resulting from HPV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schiller and Lowry collaborated on three articles published with PLOS. In the early days of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, they demonstrated that carrageenan, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from red algae, was an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.0020069&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;extremely potent infection inhibitor for sexually transmitted genital HPVs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Their most recent joint publication (also in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004314&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;investigates papillomavirus in various mouse models&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, to gain insights into immune system influences on infection progression in humans. These articles, together with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0068329&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;results of a clinical trial of bivalent HPV vaccination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; have received nearly 83,000 views.

 &lt;p&gt;In February 2016, Albert Jambon received some puzzling news. Several colleagues had alerted him to a paper, published online in late December 2015 in the Journal of African Earth Sciences (JAES), reporting the discovery of a rare mineral, which Jambon had been analyzing.
