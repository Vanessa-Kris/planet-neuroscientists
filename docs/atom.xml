		<link href="https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2017/06/new-feature-for-requesters-add-collaborators-to-your-order/"/>
		<id>https://blog.scienceexchange.com/?p=1076</id>
		<updated>2017-06-01T22:05:31+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Science, by its very nature, lends itself to collaboration. At Science Exchange, we endeavor to make discovery and access to scientific services as easy as possible – while also improving researchers’ ability to collaborate effectively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;With that goal in mind, we have released the Requester Collaboration feature. This feature allows requesters of scientific services to invite and manage additional collaborators for a project. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples of collaborators include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A member of your organization’s accounting team who needs to view the project to make payment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A colleague helping you to work through the project details with the service provider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;An administrator seeking a high level overview of research activities of their organization on Science Exchange. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new feature will enable:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Intuitive addition of collaborators to existing projects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Transparent communication between collaborating requesters and the service provider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Easy transfer of ownership between requesters/collaborators&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We will continue to listen to our users and bring new features to our platform to facilitate scientific discovery. To learn more about the Requester Collaboration Feature, view our video demo or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;check out the Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; below. If you’d like a personal demo of this feature or the Science Exchange marketplace, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:support@scienceexchange.com&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;submit a request here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Requester Collaboration Feature Video Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Requester Collaboration Feature Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What can collaborators do?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Invited collaborators will see the order on their Science Exchange Dashboard. The collaborator can access the order page, post messages, accept quotes, and mark orders as completed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;How will collaborators be notified?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Collaborators will get email notifications regarding new messages that have been posted to the order page. They can also reply to the new message email notification from their inbox and the response will be posted to the order page. However, they will not get email notifications when the provider generates a quote for the request or that the order has been completed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does this change what the primary Requester can do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There are no changes for the primary Requesters — they can still do everything, e.g., post messages, accept quotes, and mark orders as completed. As the primary Requester, you will also be notified via email of main updates regarding the order, e.g., messages, quotes submitted, quotes accepted, provider completing the order. However, you can transfer the ownership of the order to a collaborator so that they become to primary Requester.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I invite a collaborator?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Go to the order page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;On the right-hand side, under “Researchers,” you’ll see a link called “Manage.” Click on that link.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Enter your collaborator’s email and then invite them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The collaborator will get an email from Science Exchange with the invitation. They should click on the green button in the email.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The collaborator will (sign up for a Science Exchange account, and then) arrive at the order page.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Collaborator can post messages, accept quote, mark order as complete.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I transfer ownership of the order to my collaborator?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Go to the order page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;On the right-hand side, under “Researchers,” you’ll see a link called “Manage.” Click on that link.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;You’ll see your collaborator’s name. Click on the blue “Make Owner” link.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Still have questions?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We’re happy to help! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/contact&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Contact us &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;here with your questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<id>http://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2017/jun/01/researchers-develop-non-invasive-deep-brain-stimulation-method</id>
		<updated>2017-06-01T16:00:11+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT have developed a new method of electrically stimulating deep brain tissues without opening the skull&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1997, more than 100,000 Parkinson’s Disease patients have been treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS), a surgical technique that involves the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2007/03/brainsurgery/&quot;&gt;implantation of ultra-thin wire electrodes&lt;/a&gt;. The implanted device, sometimes referred to as a ‘brain pacemaker’, delivers electrical pulses to a structure called the subthalamic nucleus, located near the centre of the brain, and effectively alleviates many of the physical symptoms of the disease, such as tremor, muscle rigidity, and slowed movements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DBS is generally safe but, like any surgical procedure, comes with some risks. First and foremost, it is highly invasive, requiring small holes to be drilled in the patient’s skull, through which the electrodes are inserted. Potential &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2117492/&quot;&gt;complications&lt;/a&gt; of this include infection, stroke, and bleeding on the brain. The electrodes, which are implanted for long periods of time, sometimes move out of place; they can also cause swelling at the implantation site; and the wire connecting them to the battery, typically placed under the skin of the chest, can erode, all of which require additional surgical procedures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2015/jan/15/blowing-up-the-brain-to-reveal-its-finer-details&quot;&gt;Blowing up the brain to reveal its finer details&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2012/sep/14/memory-traces-in-a-dish&quot;&gt;Traces of memory in a dish | Mo Costandi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2017/jun/01/researchers-develop-non-invasive-deep-brain-stimulation-method&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/children-403582_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recently updated American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, mentioned in the paper, highlight that our thinking around children’s screen time needs to take into account the ubiquity of screens. We not only need to be thinking about &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; they are watching, but &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; they are watching as well (although psychologists have been telling us this for years). But now it’s not just enough to talk about watching TV, we have video games, tablets and smart phones to think about too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important question to ask is whether this proliferation of screens is accompanied by an increased awareness of screen time recommendations for children, a greater understanding of the dangers of too much screen time, and better skills for monitoring children’s screen use? It would seem not, and studies seem to indicate that parents view screen time as educational, a good babysitter, and a helpful bartering tool for dealing with uncooperative children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their paper, Jago and colleagues report on some results from the B-Proact1v study with 5-6 year old children, based in the greater Bristol area in the UK. For this paper, they focus on the screen viewing of these children and their parents, who were classified according to their level of household deprivation and their child’s level of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, measured using activity devices called accelerometers. Parents were interviewed about their child’s screen viewing (how much and if they thought it was appropriate), who influences their child’s screen viewing, and the ways in which they manage their child’s screen viewing. Parents also completed a questionnaire about their own and their child’s screen viewing habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents and children who went over the 2-hour mark had a less structured and more laid back family environment, with minimal rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the recommendation for school-going children is no more than 2 hours per day of screen time per day, parents and children who followed this recommendation were compared with parents and children who exceeded this 2-hour threshold. Not surprisingly, there were some clear differences, and these related to parents’ personal screen-related views and behaviors, the family environment, and setting rules and limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, parents and children who stuck to the &amp;lt;2 hour recommendation tended to have a family environment that encouraged activity, sought non-screen alternatives for family time, and were more likely to have rules that managed screen viewing time and content. In contrast to this, parents and children who went over the 2-hour mark had a less structured and more laid back family environment, with minimal rules and a tendency to choose screen viewing as the preferred activity for the family to relax together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings support previous work that has shown that, in comparison to permissive parents, authoritative parents who place some restrictions on the screen viewing tend to have children who spend less time in front of screens. Authoritarian parents are responsive to their children’s needs, but not afraid to put rules and limits in place, and this parenting style has been linked to a host of other positive outcomes in children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study also indicates that there is much work still to be done on informing parents of the negative impact of non-educational screen time. And that relying on screens for their educational value has its shortcomings. Lastly, when life is busy and some downtime is needed, families can watch some TV or a movie together, but this needs to be balanced with other family activities that get everyone moving. Since screens are not going anywhere, the more that parents can strike a healthy balance, the better for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely creativity is about freedom. Dropping your inhibitions – maybe with the help of a few substances – and letting ideas writhe free from the unconscious unfiltered. What to make then of the research showing that creativity is associated with higher levels of executive functioning – the mind’s suite of control processes – which seem to help by inhibiting irrelevant information and combining the rest in novel ways? Does it mean you can use this mental control to make yourself perform more creatively? According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-14257-001/&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts&lt;/i&gt; involving jazz pianists the answer may depend in part on your creative experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24263&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Rosen and his team from Drexel University suspected that the need for conscious control may be more acute when creative people are still novices, referencing saxophonist Charlie Parker’s observation that &lt;i&gt;“you’ve got to learn your instrument. Then, you practice, practice, practice. And then, when you finally get up there on the bandstand, forget all that and just wail.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this, the researchers recruited 22 mostly male jazz pianists using their number of completed professional gigs – as few as three and as many as 400 – as a measure of their creative expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After warming up at the keyboard, the musicians attempted to improvise a pre-recorded track “as you normally would in a jazz setting.” After the first take, they were given three more tries. Crucially, before one of these efforts they were told that from now on they should “improvise even more creatively than your past performance(s).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could the participants deliberately boost their creativity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the experiment, the musicians said they’d taken the instruction to heart: “I tried other things that I wouldn’t normally try”; “I felt totally freed. I felt like I’d been given license to go wherever my mind took me”; “I considered new elements of my performance while improvising with explicit instructions”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for performers with fewer gigs behind them, this seemed to help: independent judges rated their improvisations as more proficient, aesthetically appealing, and creative, as compared to equivalent takes with no instructions. But more experienced musicians saw smaller benefits, with the effect for the most experienced players tipping (non-significantly in statistical terms) in the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings add to past research showing that while mental control may be important for creativity, there is also a part to play for automatic, uncontrolled mental processes. For example, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and even brain damage to the frontal regions involved in executive function are both associated with heightened creativity. Mind-wandering and dreaming also seem to produce creative leaps. One explanation is that creativity is an interplay between automatic associative processes and deliberate effortful ones, or Type One and Type Two processes (as per Daniel Kahneman’s terminology). Freedom &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen in these terms, expert players may, over time, find their own balance of Type One and Two processes when improvising, such that conscious attention can’t easily lead to further improvements. In contrast, those with lower levels of mastery can find it productive to call on creative techniques intentionally or test out variants – “I wonder if I can try dropping different notes from an arpeggio run.” So for those of us not yet at the top of our creative game, making the conscious effort to focus on novel, creative outcomes might be the tactic to take us to new heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-14257-001/&quot;&gt;All You Need to Do Is Ask? The Exhortation to Be Creative Improves Creative Performance More for Nonexpert Than Expert Jazz Musicians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Pixabay&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/heidelberg-1703363_1920-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chromatin and Epigenetics EMBO conference is a biannual event that gathers together top speakers covering the latest advances in chromatin and epigenetics research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the front cover of the conference booklet was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Wolffe&quot;&gt;Dr Alan Wolffe&lt;/a&gt; (1959-2001) a scientist who in the last three years of his life alone, published a number of articles on epigenetics including the role of DNA methylation in regulating gene expression in normal and pathological states, chromatin remodeling in transcriptional repression and activation, and the molecular mechanisms of gene misregulation in disease, including cancer and Rett syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific programme was broadly along the same lines. It was organized into a number of sessions, namely chromatin regulation, developmental epigenetics, making and breaking heterochromatin, histone modifications, RNA and metabolism, transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation, nuclear architecture and remodelling chromatin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of particular interest was the series of talks on epigenetic reprogramming and regulation, including HOX genes regulation during vertebrate development, epigenetic reprogramming in mouse development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal favorite was a fascinating talk on the &lt;strong&gt;role of epigenetic regulation on social behavior in ants&lt;/strong&gt;, describing work by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/p8678096&quot;&gt;Dr Roberto Bonasio&lt;/a&gt;  and colleagues from the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Pixabay&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-9036 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/ant-954015_1920-300x200.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Pixabay&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonasio explained how ant societies are very sophisticated, with different groups (or castes) arising from a single genome and having different roles. Each caste is distinct in appearance (morphology) and has different behavioral traits. Female embryos become &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_ant&quot;&gt;queens&lt;/a&gt; or one of a number of different types of worker ants. The developmental path of each individual ant is – strikingly – completely independent from their genetic makeup. The differences between each ant caste (their phenotype) must therefore be due to epigenetic modifications (i.e. not explained by changes in DNA sequence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonasio’s group have sequenced the genome for the ant species; &lt;em&gt;Camponotus floridanus&lt;/em&gt;, obtaining both genome-wide DNA methylation and chromatin structure profiles. Unlike for some other ant species, Harpegnathos queens can be replaced by worker ants, which then develop the behavioral and phenotypic traits of the queen. This unique behavior allows researchers to investigate the role of epigenetic pathways in regulating brain function and behavior. By obtaining the gene expression profiles of Harpegnathos ants before, during and after their transition from worker to queen, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropeptide&quot;&gt;neuropeptide&lt;/a&gt; has been identified that that stimulates worker ant behaviors such as foraging while blocking the transition to queen status. This is exciting as it’s the first time a neuropeptide, and transcriptional regulation in general, is shown to play a role in caste determination and caste-specific behavior in a social organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other main highlights of the conference were, as expected, the two Keynote lectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imaging the 3D organization of the genome and transcriptome in single cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://zhuang.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;Professor Xiaowei Zhuang&lt;/a&gt;, from Harvard University presented some super-resolution imaging and multiplex &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization&quot;&gt;fluorescent in situ hybridization&lt;/a&gt; (FISH) imaging methods developed in her laboratory that have produced high resolution images of the 3D conformation of chromatin in the cell nucleus. She demonstrated,  with the help of a collection of beautiful images,  how these methods have been used to, for example,  confirm that chromatin is organized into large contact domains called TADS (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topologically_associating_domain&quot;&gt;topologically associating domains&lt;/a&gt;), but folding in a way that differs from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10577-010-9177-0&quot;&gt;classical fractal-globule model&lt;/a&gt; at large length scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;MERFISH has helped map the distribution of RNA inside cells and distinct cell types in complex tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single-cell transcriptome imaging method called multiplexed error-robust FISH (&lt;a href=&quot;http://zhuang.harvard.edu/merfish.html&quot;&gt;MERFISH&lt;/a&gt;) was also described,  Professor Zhuang presented a number of applications for the technique, including mapping the distribution of RNA inside cells and also distinct cell types in complex tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epigenetics and Rett syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very last talk presented at the conference was one by &lt;a href=&quot;http://birdlab.bio.ed.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;Professor Adrian Bird&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Edinburgh.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/rett-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx&quot;&gt;Rett syndrome&lt;/a&gt; is a devastating autistic spectrum disorder that affects the development of female children; it is very rarely seen in males. Sufferers seem normal at first, with symptoms typically appearing around the age of 2 to 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Bird has discovered the cause of the disorder, mutations to the so-called Rett gene &lt;em&gt;MeCP2. &lt;/em&gt;He explained that the MeCP2 protein binds to DNA sites that can be chemically altered by DNA methylation, which has an effect on gene expression. Although other hypotheses do exist, it is thought that the primary function of the MeCP2 protein is to affect DNA methylation in such a way as to block transcription; this is supported by biochemical and genetic analyses of the protein and also by the number of different mutations to the gene that causes the condition. MeCP2-deficiency leads to the development of a number of serious neurological disorders, including, of course, Rett syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part of the talk, however, was a very visual demonstration, using mice as models, that the disorder is potentially curable with the aid of videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video 1 shows a MeCP2-deficient mouse with Rett Syndrome like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Taken from the &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt; YouTube channel – url https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHXU25NTGf4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video 2 shows the same mouse after MeCP2-replacement therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Taken from the &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt; YouTube channel – url https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVUq5C9LS-4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I would certainly recommend this conference to anyone with an interest in the field and I look forward to the programme in two years time.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/earthworm-686593_960_720-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Para&quot; id=&quot;Par6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;em class=&quot;EmphasisTypeItalic&quot;&gt;The plough is one of the most ancient and most valuable of man’s inventions; but long before he existed the land was in fact regularly ploughed, and still continues to be thus ploughed by earth-worms. It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world, as have these lowly organised creatures.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Para&quot; id=&quot;Par7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Darwin, &lt;em class=&quot;EmphasisTypeItalic&quot;&gt;The formation of vegetable mould through the actions of worms, with observations on their habits&lt;/em&gt;, pg. 313&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earthworms digging about in your back yard are members of a large, ubiquitous group with a deep evolutionary history. There are over 6000 earthworm species, found on all continents except Antarctica. Most earthworms dwell in soil, but many live in leaf litter, decaying logs and riverbanks, while some live in trees and even along the seashore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earthworms are major terrestrial ecosystem engineers and their economic impact is immense—earthworms turn over, aerate and drain soils, providing crucial assistance to farmers and gardeners, and compost-dwelling species are used to process food waste and animal manures. Aristotle recognized their importance as the “Intestines of the Earth”, and their reputation was burnished by Charles Darwin in &lt;em&gt;The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms&lt;/em&gt;. On the other hand, a Chinese sage said “watch the earthworm, miss the eclipse”, implying that there are better things to observe. We might disagree, especially in the cases of bioluminescent earthworms, one of which (&lt;em&gt;Avelona ligra&lt;/em&gt;) was sampled for this project, wildly colored earthworms (e.g., &lt;em&gt;Archipheretima&lt;/em&gt; spp.), and those capable of remarkable feats of climbing, some found 40 meters up in French Guyana rainforests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9057&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9057&quot; height=&quot;271&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/A.ligra-impression-ps.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;The bioluminescent worm &lt;em&gt;Avelona ligra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Marcel Koken&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their value, earthworms are generally ignored until they are needed for bait or become a problem. Approximately one-third of the earthworm species in North America have been introduced from Europe or Asia. Some have been introduced into northern forests, which have been free from earthworms since the end of the last ice age ~11,000 years ago. Many other species in these forests rely on a deep layer of decaying leaf material, and earthworms are uniquely adapted to disturb this material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although earthworms are among the most familiar and economically important groups of large invertebrates, their evolutionary history is not well understood. As part of a collaborative effort funded by the US National Science Foundation to study annelid phylogeny, we harnessed high-throughput DNA sequencing to generate transcriptomes for representatives of nearly all of the eighteen living earthworm families as well as several groups thought to be closely related to them and used these data to infer phylogenetic relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9058&quot; style=&quot;width: 470px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9058&quot; height=&quot;276&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Archipheretima-middletoni-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;460&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;The colourful earthworm species &lt;em&gt;Archipheretima middletoni&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Sam James&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that the earthworm tree of life consists of two major branches, both with subgroups in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. One of these branches includes at least three families, two found in eastern North America and one in Madagascar. The other branch contains the vast majority of earthworm species—the northern subgroup includes Lumbricidae, comprising nearly all familiar European species, and the southern subgroup includes Megascolecoidea (a group represented on all southern landmasses plus much of North America), two large Neotropical families and a tropical African family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One long-standing question is whether the broad geographic distribution of earthworms is due to dispersal between continents (e.g., by rafting) or vicariance—riding the continents as they’ve drifted over several hundred million years—or a combination of these processes. We can use our phylogeny to assess the relative importance of these competing mechanisms, but to do so, we had to calibrate our phylogeny to the geological time scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earthworms have left an impressive record of trace fossils, but it is difficult to determine which species made a particular set of fossilized burrows, since body fossils are extremely rare. However, earthworms and their relatives lay their eggs in cocoons, and sometimes these cocoons fossilize. Leech cocoon fossils are known from the late Triassic, 201 million years ago, which tells us not only the minimum age of leeches, but also the minimum age of the common ancestor of leeches and earthworms. We were able to use these fossils to calibrate our phylogeny and infer divergence dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9059&quot; style=&quot;width: 970px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9059&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Eisenia_cocoon.png&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;An earthworm cocoon.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our analyses reveal that the ancestor of all living earthworms probably lived over 209 million years ago, making earthworms about as old as mammals and dinosaurs. Our date estimates for the divergences between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere subgroups of the two major branches of earthworms fall between 178-186 million years ago, coinciding with the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea 180-200 million years ago and corroborating the hypothesis that continental breakup influenced early earthworm diversification. This also implies that earthworms likely inhabited Antarctica before the continent’s southward drift made it inimical to most terrestrial animal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our phylogeny also provides a robust framework for investigating several questions about earthworm evolution. At several points in the phylogeny, earthworms have transitioned from terrestrial to aquatic habitats and vice versa. Most species in Clitellata (the group that includes earthworms) are aquatic, so earthworm genomes may retain ancestral genes that enable transitions between habitats. Alternatively, certain features may have been reinvented at each habitat transition. We have begun to explore this question, and hope to investigate other aspects of earthworm gene and genome evolution in our future work.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/05/Brain-Blue-1-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sociability and the medial prefrontal cortex &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could it be possible to run a normal existence without social life? Indeed, sociability is an important aspect for individuals and social interactions build our lives. In fact, social interaction enhances quality of life and improves the stability of communities. Impaired sociability is a classical symptom observed in many neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety and generalized fear. Interestingly, many studies have pointed to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain area located in the ventromedial part of the frontal lobe, as a key region involved in the neural bases of sociability (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25727858&quot;&gt;Valk et al, 2015&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25109665&quot;&gt;Treadway et al., 2015&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17714666&quot;&gt;Frith et al., 2007&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prelimbic cortex (PL) and the infralimbic cortex (IL), two subregions of the mPFC, have been strongly suggested to play an important role in the neural mechanisms underlying sociability as isolation rearing in rats results in impaired social behavior and structural modifications in the PL and IL. Isolation rearing is a neurodevelopmental manipulation that produces neurochemical, structural, and behavioral alterations in rodents that in many ways are consistent with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety and depression. In particular, it has been shown that isolation rearing can alter the volume of mPFC, the dendritic length and the spine density of pyramidal neurons. However, the detailed mechanisms involved in sociability disorders remain elusive and poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Altered mPFC activity after isolation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent article published in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0176740&quot;&gt;Plos ONE&lt;/a&gt; by Minami and colleagues aimed at measuring neural activity in the PL and IL of control and isolated rats during social interaction in order to determine whether there is neural activity related to social behavior in these areas. Experimentally, animals were divided equally into 2 groups at postnatal day (P) 21 and were housed either in groups (control, group-reared rats) or single-cage (isolation-reared rats).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does isolation influence mPFC activity? To tackle this question, multiunit recording was used as technique to record neural activity in freely moving animals during social behavior testing. However, as stated by the authors, “&lt;em&gt;the conventional technique requires that the animal be tethered to recording instruments with a cable of electrical wires&lt;/em&gt;” and this technical aspect may not facilitate natural and spontaneous social behavior in rats. To overcome these issue, Minami and colleagues used a wireless telemetry system to record the neural activity of a pair of freely moving rats during social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behaviors in the social interaction test were categorized as &lt;em&gt;sole&lt;/em&gt; (rats behave separately from each other), &lt;em&gt;approaching&lt;/em&gt; (rat approaching the partner, reduction of distance), &lt;em&gt;contact&lt;/em&gt; (which includes social exploration, aggressiveness and defensiveness), and &lt;em&gt;leaving&lt;/em&gt; (rat leaving the partner).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_19357&quot; style=&quot;width: 410px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/05/social-behavior.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-19357&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/05/social-behavior-300x293.jpg&quot; width=&quot;410&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Examples showing the behavior of the rats during the social interaction test. A, B: Sole behavior. Rats are behaving separately. The rat (no mark on its back) is exploring around by itself at the lower left corner of the test box and the partner (a black mark on its back) is resting at the lower right corner (A). Both rats are walking along the wall (B). C, D: Approaching behavior. The rat (arrow) is approaching the partner (C), and the partner (arrow) is approaching the rat (D). E–G: Contact behavior. Rats are sniffing (E) and boxing (F) each other, and the rat (arrow) is pinning and biting the partner (G). H, I: Leaving behavior. The rat (arrow) is leaving the partner (H), and the partner (arrow) is leaving the rat (I).&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In control rats (non isolated ones) PL neurons showed increased firing rate during both approaching and contact behaviors, especially when the rat attacked the partner. In contrast to PL neurons, IL neurons showed increased firing only during leaving behavior. Several studies using electrophysiological recordings have shown that the increased firing of PL neurons is correlated with sustained fear, whereas the increased firing of IL neurons is correlated with the recall of extinction (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16420154&quot;&gt;Gilmartin and McEchron, 2005&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24231425&quot;&gt;Fitzgerald PJ et al., 2014&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about isolated animals? Is neuronal activity different during social interaction?&lt;strong&gt; “&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isolation-reared rats showed an increased frequency and decreased duration of contact behavior in the present study. These results may be interpreted as that isolation-reared rats are interested in a novel partner but cannot continue contact behavior with the partner for a long period&lt;/em&gt;”, report the authors of the study. In agreement with this hypothesis, it has been reported that isolation-reared animals show a decreased duration of sociability as well as a hyperactivity to novel stimuli. Details analysis of the results revealed that PL neurons were characterized by increasing firing during approaching and contact behaviors (as reported in non-isolated rats). Conversely, IL neurons in isolation-reared rats did not show increased firing during leaving behavior (as observed in control animals), indicating that the increased firing of IL neurons observed during leaving behavior in group-reared rats is suppressed by isolation rearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;The present data demonstrate the neural activity of the PL and IL during social interaction and the influence of isolation rearing on this activity. The differential effects of isolation rearing on the neural activity of the PL and IL may be one of the neural bases of isolation-induced behavior&lt;/em&gt;”, conclude Akira Mitani, the senior investigator of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further investigations are needed to fully understand the role of mPFC in sociability, perhaps paving the way to discovery of alternative solutions for neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/cancer-389921_1920-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are the most effective and cost-efficient weapons that can be used to prevent (preventive vaccines) or cure (therapeutic vaccines) diseases caused by infectious agents or cancer cells. Usually, when one thinks about the word vaccine, the first thought that comes into the mind is related to an artificial administration of a stimulus that instructs the immune system to fight against the cause of a particular pathological state (the pathogen). However, in the case of cancer vaccines, the main view, still unknown to the majority of the people not working in the field,  is represented by the exploitation of the host’s immune system to treat or prevent cancer. The idea, however, dates back decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way a “traditional” vaccine works, a cancer vaccine can promote the eradication of malignant cells during their initial transformation from safe to harmful cells. This eradication process, commonly referred to as immune surveillance of tumors [1], is carried out by the immune system and, most of the time, it happens without any external intervention. Tumors are the result of a particular combination of factors related to genetic and epigenetic changes that enable immortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same way a “traditional” vaccine works, a cancer vaccine can promote the eradication of malignant cells during their initial transformation from safe to harmful cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a completely undetectable process: during the transformation of a normal cell into a malignant one, foreign antigens (neo-antigens or, to be more specific, onco-antigens) are created;  these should render neoplastic cells visible by the immune system that can target them for elimination. Tumors cells, like every living organisms, want, nevertheless, to live. Hence, tumors try to become resistant and invisible to immune system attacks by developing multiple resistance mechanisms that include local immune evasion, induction of tolerance and systemic interference of T cell signaling. Besides, mimicking the metaphor of Darwin’s natural selection, immune recognition of cancer cells enforces a selective pressure on developing ones. This favors the development of less immunogenic and more apoptosis-resistant neoplastic cells, through a mechanism well known as immune editing [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the fact that cancer cells are particularly good at evading any action from the immune system, most anti-cancer treatments are based on other means like surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Nowadays, however, it is clear that the various arms of the immune system play an essential role in protecting humans from cancer. After unsatisfactory efforts and explicit clinical failures, the field of cancer immunotherapy has received a significant boost, thanks mainly to the development in 2010 of an autologous cellular immunotherapy, sipuleucel-T, for the treatment of prostate cancer [3] and the approval of the anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) antibody ipilimumab (2011) and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) antibodies (2014) for the treatment of melanoma [4]. These achievements have renovated the field and brought attention to the opportunities that immunotherapeutic approaches can offer [5,6].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9070&quot; style=&quot;width: 248px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pixabay&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9070&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/syringe-30012_1280-238x300.png&quot; width=&quot;238&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;The field of cancer immunotherapy has recently received a significant boost&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still, however, some difficulties to be overcome when developing effective immunotherapy strategies against cancer. The general lack of understanding of the mechanisms of immunization, the role of dendritic cells, the ability of cancer to induce tolerance, and the identification of the most suitable antigens to use are just some examples of how the development of effective strategies is still problematic [7-10]. There are several biotechnological methodologies, based on both&lt;em&gt; in silico&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; techniques, that study and suggest possible candidates for use in immunotherapies. However, they are not able, on their own, to quantify and analyze the immune system response globally. Moreover, there are now several computational techniques to predict T cell epitopes (and, to some extent, also B cell epitopes) [11,12]. Computational simulations may help in solving these issues, but these need to be integrated with the &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; molecular analyses [13,14]. So, a complete computational/biological pipeline that allow the best integration of  &lt;em&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; methodologies may potentially  boost and improve cancer immunotherapy development and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the thematic series is to bring together the latest advances in both biological and computational research, looking broadly at the basic biological aspects of immunotherapy, emerging immunotherapies (both prophylactic and preventive) and different vaccination approaches. The novel, and, at the same time, established character of computation in immunology greatly improves and speeds-up the development of novel vaccination strategies, both therapeutic and preventive, against cancer. We welcome original research, methodology, software, and database article submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadline for submission of manuscripts is 30th November 2017. For more information, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/civ&quot;&gt;visit the &lt;em&gt;BMC Immunology &lt;/em&gt;website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2017-05-31T12:54:52+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Fast-food-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes including increased consumption of high fat diets have caused a considerable rise in individuals who are overweight and obese in the past decades. Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. These individuals have increased blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and cholesterol levels, leading to various other health complications. According to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), 1 in 11 adults have diabetes, and 21% of the world’s population will be affected by diabetes by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several clinical trials have proposed the useful effects of lifestyle intervention for controlling obesity and diabetes, however, in many cases restoring the glycemic index to normal levels does not ameliorate diabetic complications. This has been attributed to “metabolic memory” or “legacy effect”. High glucose conditions induce long-term cellular changes which are not completely restored after normalizing glycaemia. Metabolic memory due to programing has been attributed to induced epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation which alter normal gene expression and cell function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3799-y&quot;&gt;published recently&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Genomics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,  assessed the physiological and cellular effects of high caloric diet induced hyperglycemia followed by caloric restriction, a common approach of controlling obesity in accordance with metabolic memory in non-human primates. Skeletal muscle being the major site of glucose intake, was the tissue of interest for this study. We included 6 male rhesus macaques and put them on western style calorie dense diets for 6 months followed by a calorie restricted diet to 70% of their required caloric intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed that a high-fat diet increased body weight, blood glucose and caused insulin resistance in macaques and calorie restriction in the same animals returned these levels to normal but had only a partial effect on fat loss. Findings from our transcriptional analysis showed that high-fat diet reprograms the skeletal muscle to induce changes which persist even after calorie restriction. Genes involved in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling remained downregulated post high-fat diet and caloric restriction while those involved in extracellular matrix remodeling remained upregulated. We also suspect that changes in the inflammatory response induced by high fat diet might induce ROS-related stress and other metabolic pathway changes which adapts the skeletal muscle to high fat environment. Related to metabolic memory, we identified a major epigenetic modifier SETD7 to be expressed at reduced levels following calorie restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve long term problems associated with obesity it is important to identify the changes it induces within the cell. Identification of these factors through our study as compared to other studies provides possible cellular changes within the cell which can be targeted through medical intervention in addition to lifestyle intervention to improve health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9061&quot; style=&quot;width: 1010px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9061 size-full&quot; height=&quot;318&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Western-diet-and-obesity-blog-figure.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet-induced metabolic memory:&lt;/strong&gt; The figure summarizes our study in Rhesus macaques skeletal muscle tissue following dietary changes that change body weight and insulin resistance. High-fat western style diet leads to hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia which induces transcriptional memory within the fat cell, which is not restored to normal even after glycemic normalization post calorie restricted diet.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Four, as in the UK? Six or seven, as in Sweden? What about one?&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/dev/53/5/815.html&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Developmental Psychology, &lt;/i&gt;children as young as 12-months-old can be taught to get better at focusing their attention – which may help with their acquisition of language, and other types of learning. This new study involved typical, healthy infants. But the findings could also be taken as support for the idea that interventions aimed at children showing problems with attention (who may go on to be diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, for example) can, and should, start at a very young age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24245&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research on children aged four and over has found that training tasks designed to improve attentional control can lead to more general improvements in attention (so not just on the tasks used in training). But there hasn’t been much work on younger children, and the limited work that has been done hasn’t investigated whether any improvements last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaili Clarkson at the University of Cambridge, and colleagues, divided 48 boys and girls, all aged about one, into a training group and two control groups. Each child first completed a roughly 20-minute series of tests of attentional control. These included an evaluation of how long they took to predict the next letter in a ABABAB sequence, the number of times they had to look at picture of a child’s face before they learned to recognise it, as well as an evaluation of general attentiveness during the entire testing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training group then received a total of 95 minutes of training over five sessions, spaced out over about two weeks. While sitting on their parent’s laps, these infants were presented in each session with six different tasks that rewarded them if they focused on a target. For example, in one, if a child looked away from a moving butterfly (the target) to a distractor, the display froze, and only un-froze when the child again focused on the butterfly. Another task required the infants to work out (with animations given as rewards) when the target changed from an image of an elephant to a chicken, while, again, ignoring distractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after the fifth training session, and then also six weeks later, the infants in all groups took the initial tests of attentional control again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right after training, there were significant improvements in the training group’s sustained attention, compared with their initial scores. These infants were also faster at learning to recognise another child’s face and at sequence learning and general attentiveness. (The controls showed no significant improvements.) The trained children only failed to improve on one test: memory for an image that they had previously learned to recognise. (At this young age, short term memory capacity may be too weak to be trained, the researchers suggested.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarkson and her colleagues also found lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol in the trained infants, compared with the controls, during these post-training testing sessions. And they think this is important because it suggests that targeting attention skills may lead to improved self-regulation, and lower anxiety levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six weeks on, the trained infants’ improvements in general attentiveness and habituation to a face had gone, as had the reduction in their cortisol levels. However, although  improvements in their sustained attention had faded a little, they were still statistically significant, and the trained infants were still faster at learning sequences than they were initially, and in comparison with the control groups’ scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the relative brevity of the training, it’s not surprising that there was a loss of or deterioration in improvements after six weeks. For comparison, the work on attention training in older children has generally involved training periods of around 10 hours, over 20-25 sessions. Future work should investigate whether longer-term training of one-year-olds could boost and sustain the types of improvements seen right after training in this study – and whether there are wider ranging benefits for language learning and other aspects of development. “Given the evidence that cortical activation patterns are less localised and specialised early in development”, it’s likely that training one-year-olds would lead to more generalised improvements than in older children, the researchers suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So should parents be rushing off to train their infants’ attention? This study (and others) have found benefits in the short term, in the lab. But what real-world effects training might – or might not – bring is not yet clear.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Cristina Barrero-Sicilia's journal club session where she discusses the paper, &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1082-1&quot;&gt;Rapid gene isolation in barley and wheat by mutant chromosome sequencing (Sánchez-Martín et al. (2016))&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identification of causal mutations in barley and wheat is hampered by their
large genomes and suppressed recombination. To overcome these obstacles, we
have developed MutChromSeq, a complexity reduction approach based on flow
sorting and sequencing of mutant chromosomes, to identify induced mutations by
comparison to parental chromosomes. We apply MutChromSeq to six mutants each of
the barley Eceriferum-q gene and the wheat Pm2 genes. This approach
unambiguously identified single candidate genes that were verified by Sanger
sequencing of additional mutants. MutChromSeq enables reference-free forward
genetics in barley and wheat, thus opening up their pan-genomes to functional
genomics.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Liverpool-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for testing new medical interventions on a population, with their use increasing exponentially throughout the twentieth century up to the present day. With their increasing use and complexity, new challenges have emerged in regards to how RCTs are conducted. This congress brought together leaders in the field to discuss every aspect of the methodology of RCTs including trial design, data analysis and reporting of trial outcomes amongst others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current issues and challenges &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of the three keynote talks, by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p4930413&quot;&gt;Dr Susan Ellenberg&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Pennsylvania, considered the on-going challenges and the emerging issues of clinical trials in the twenty first century. The first published RCT of the modern era was conducted in 1948 and since then the RCT has undergone constant change and development. One example of this is increasing the complexity of a clinical trial by incorporating individualized treatments dependent on specific biomarkers present in certain members of the study population. However, this brings with it a range of issues including which diseases require individualized treatment, the ethics of pursuing targeted treatments over broad treatments and the cost of these more complex trials. Another issue discussed was how clinical research can be carried out in an emergency situation such as the Ebola outbreak of 2014. In order to both treat patients and also investigate the most effective treatments, clinical research should be implemented from the beginning of the response to ensure that answers are found as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9046&quot; style=&quot;width: 3811px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9046&quot; height=&quot;2681&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/Keynote1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;3801&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Susan Ellenberg&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical trials in the age of big data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another huge development in medical research in the last few decades has been the proliferation of “big data”. One of the most ambitious projects aiming to use big data in healthcare research is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.research.va.gov/mvp/&quot;&gt;Million Veteran Program&lt;/a&gt; (MVP) with one of the leaders, &lt;a href=&quot;http://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/652/john-gaziano-cardiovascular_medicine-boston&quot;&gt;Dr Michael Gaziano&lt;/a&gt;, delivering the second keynote talk. The project aims to enrol one million veterans and will store a range of information on each individual, including self-reported lifestyle data alongside biospecimens. This forms one of the most comprehensive data sets in the world and can be used to research human health and disease. The development of such a large data set has brought many challenges such as learning how to structure and phenotype the data to allow it to be used to answer specific research questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing of clinical trial data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more and more data being collected on individual participants in clinical research, another theme at the conference was data sharing to improve research efficiency. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/translational-medicine/staff/catrin-tudur-smith/&quot;&gt;Catrin Tudur Smith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/steff-lewis&quot;&gt;Steff Lewis&lt;/a&gt; led a very interesting invited session with contributors discussing how clinical trial data can be shared more effectively, how participants view data sharing, and what data sharing might look like in the future. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/editorial-staff/trish-groves&quot;&gt;Trish Groves&lt;/a&gt;, Editor in Chief of &lt;em&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/em&gt;, provided the point-of-view of the publisher and suggested that journals have a big part to play in encouraging the publication of anonymized data sets alongside trial results. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctu.mrc.ac.uk/about_us/senior_staff_profiles/matt_sydes/&quot;&gt;Matt Sydes&lt;/a&gt; of the MRC Clinical Trials Unit presented some of the challenges surrounding data sharing, including effective anonymization of the data as well as deciding which data sets are worth preparing for sharing as this can be a time consuming and costly process. The importance of data security was also covered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/profile/400/1451/gillian_booth&quot;&gt;Gillian Booth&lt;/a&gt; as well as the importance of obtaining appropriate consent for data sharing from the participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The UK NIHR Health Technology Assessment Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final keynote was delivered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/medicine/people/hywel.williams&quot;&gt;Professor Hywel Williams&lt;/a&gt; who spoke about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nihr.ac.uk/funding-and-support/funding-for-research-studies/funding-programmes/health-technology-assessment/&quot;&gt;UK NIHR Health Technology Assessment Programme&lt;/a&gt; which is one of the largest UK funding bodies of clinical trials, with results directly influencing clinical practice in the NHS. One of the main aims of the program is to conduct timely research to answer specific questions that are required to improve current clinical practice. This is done through a prioritization process to determine which research projects are most needed and are generally those that are important to the NHS, are supported by current evidence, are feasible and that are clear and well defined. One of the take home messages was that the program aims to strike a balance between influencing the research community and also being led by the research community in terms of deciding which projects should be funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The high demand for external manufacturing capacity and expertise is one driving force behind the proliferation of CMOs and CDMOs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;According to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niceinsight.com/articles.aspx?post=3058&amp;amp;title=Strong+CMO/CDMO+Market+Outlook+for+2016,+but+Beware+Moderating+Factors&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;2016 survey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, biopharma organizations cite the need to improve quality as the primary reason for using contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) and contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs). Additional goals for outsourcing include reducing time to market, controlling costs, achieving supply chain diversity, leveraging regulatory expertise, and accessing specialized technologies, including those required for complex biologics manufacturing processes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Competition between CMOs: Innovative manufacturing services&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Competition in the marketplace is driving CMOs to develop innovative manufacturing technologies to capture new service categories — choosing a cutting-edge CMO partner can give a biopharma company advantages over its competitors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Many CMOs and CDMOs have adopted process improvements to provide their clients with faster cycle times and more informed decision-making. These improvements include cloud-based computing, real-time risk-monitoring tools, and integrated quality-by-design during process development. Suc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;h process improvements are especially important given &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;the ability of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://resultshealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Pharmaceutical-Manufacturing.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;multiple CMOs to manufacture the same API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. Nearly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://resultshealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Results-Healthcare_Pharma-Biotech-2017-Review-of-outsourced-manufacturing_Whitepaper.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;90%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; of the volume of drugs sold are generic small molecule therapeutics, requiring high production capacity that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;may be provided by any number of CMOs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Other CMOs differentiate themselves through specialized expertise – for example, they may be leaders in developing novel formulations, such as nanoparticles or lipid-based delivery systems. Some CMOs offer specialized regulatory certifications, such as CLIA/CAP, GLP, and GCP. Although cGMP compliance is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pcisynthesis.com/how-to-get-your-organization-prepared-for-an-fda-inspection/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;not absolutely required for all CMO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;s, most reputable CMOs are cGMP certified.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contract manufacturing of biologics and complex therapeutics: a growth opportunity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It has been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biopharma-reporter.com/Upstream-Processing/Biologics-CMO-demand-to-drop-as-Big-Pharma-favours-in-house-capacity&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;challenging to outsource the manufacture of biologics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, such as vaccines, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, and cell therapies, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nyas.org/Events/Detail.aspx?cid=07082904-d593-4f0e-ada7-446ec8e7444b&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;non-biological complex drugs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. These fast-growing segments are fac&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;ed with regulatory hurdles, a need for specialized drug delivery devices, and inherent risks involved in method transfer and ensuring consistent supply. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Despite the challenges of method transfer, technological improvements are facilitating partnerships between biopharma companies and CMOs in biologics pipelines. Emerging categories of therapeutics, such as cell therapies and antibody-drug conjugates, as well as novel formulations, such as nanoparticles, have benefited from specialized manufacturers. Even though some of these specialty drug products may require bespoke manufacturing processes, CMOs stay agile through integrated quality-by-design during process development and take advantage of connected single-use technologies for streamlined yet flexible bioprocessing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Barriers facing discovery and qualification of manufacturing service providers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The demand for contract manufacturing, combined with the growth opportunities around innovation and biologics, have resulted in a marketplace with thousands of active CMOs and CDMOs. It can be time-consuming and difficult to identify qualified service providers with the right certifications to meet regulatory compliance requirements. Though many service providers are staffed by innovative, highly qualified scientists with experience in the biopharma industry, many service providers lack such expertise. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Because there are no clear third-party qualification processes or objective benchmarks for quality, and because biopharma companies lack the time to perform regulatory compliance audits of all the service providers in this fragmented sector, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niceinsight.com/articles.aspx?post=3058&amp;amp;title=Strong+CMO/CDMO+Market+Outlook+for+2016,+but+Beware+Moderating+Factors&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;over 68% of biopharma companies use a preferred provider strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; for outsourced manufacturing. Relying on preferred providers may decrease the agility of companies to take advantage of emerging technologies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;For contract manufacturing to add maximum value to an organization, responsible teams should consider adhering to a defined sourcing strategy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Checklist for a successful contract manufacturing partnership&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To maximize the advantages offered by a successful CMO partnership, the procurement and external resource management teams of a biopharma company must ensure that their sourcing strategy includes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Keeping abreast of emerging technologies and service providers;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Stringently qualifying service providers based on turnaround time, product quality, cost, and regulatory compliance;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Identifying service gaps and assessing value of existing preferred providers; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Streamlining the contracting process to enable rapid onboarding of innovative service providers;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Establishing contracts that protect intellectual property and confidentiality, to maintain competitive advantage and minimize risk;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Managing project milestones to ensure that projects are completed on time and as planned;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Keeping meticulous records so that methods can be transferred in house or to other service providers as needed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) regulates glucose homeostasis through the control of insulin release from the pancreas. GLP-1 peptide agonists are efficacious drugs for the treatment of diabetes. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of action of GLP-1 peptides, here we report the crystal structure of the full-length GLP-1 receptor bound to a truncated peptide agonist. The peptide agonist retains an α-helical conformation as it sits deep within the receptor-binding pocket. The arrangement of the transmembrane helices reveals hallmarks of an active conformation similar to that observed in class A receptors. Guided by this structural information, we design peptide agonists with potent in vivo activity in a mouse model of diabetes.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Cpf1 is an RNA-guided endonuclease that is emerging as a powerful genome-editing tool. Here we provide insight into its DNA-targeting mechanism by determining the structure of Francisella novicida Cpf1 with the triple-stranded R-loop generated after DNA cleavage. The structure reveals the machinery involved in DNA unwinding to form a CRISPR RNA (crRNA)–DNA hybrid and a displaced DNA strand. The protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) is recognized by the PAM-interacting domain. The loop-lysine helix–loop motif in this domain contains three conserved lysine residues that are inserted in a dentate manner into the double-stranded DNA. Unzipping of the double-stranded DNA occurs in a cleft arranged by acidic and hydrophobic residues facilitating the crRNA–DNA hybrid formation. The PAM single-stranded DNA is funnelled towards the nuclease site through a mixed hydrophobic and basic cavity. In this catalytic conformation, the PAM-interacting domain and the helix–loop–helix motif in the REC1 domain adopt a ‘rail’ shape and ‘flap-on’ conformations, respectively, channelling the PAM strand into the cavity. A steric barrier between the RuvC-II and REC1 domains forms the ‘septum’, separating the displaced PAM strand and the crRNA–DNA hybrid, avoiding DNA re-annealing. Mutations in key residues reveal a mechanism linking the PAM and DNA nuclease sites. Analysis of the Cpf1 structures proposes a singular working model of RNA-guided DNA cleavage, suggesting new avenues for redesign of Cpf1.

 Expansions of short nucleotide repeats produce several neurological and neuromuscular disorders including Huntington disease, muscular dystrophy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A common pathological feature of these diseases is the accumulation of the repeat-containing transcripts into aberrant foci in the nucleus. RNA foci, as well as the disease symptoms, only manifest above a critical number of nucleotide repeats, but the molecular mechanism governing foci formation above this characteristic threshold remains unresolved. Here we show that repeat expansions create templates for multivalent base-pairing, which causes purified RNA to undergo a sol–gel transition in vitro at a similar critical repeat number as observed in the diseases. In human cells, RNA foci form by phase separation of the repeat-containing RNA and can be dissolved by agents that disrupt RNA gelation in vitro. Analogous to protein aggregation disorders, our results suggest that the sequence-specific gelation of RNAs could be a contributing factor to neurological disease.

 Adult pair bonding involves dramatic changes in the perception and valuation of another individual. One key change is that partners come to reliably activate the brain’s reward system, although the precise neural mechanisms by which partners become rewarding during sociosexual interactions leading to a bond remain unclear. Here we show, using a prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) model of social bonding, how a functional circuit from the medial prefrontal cortex to nucleus accumbens is dynamically modulated to enhance females’ affiliative behaviour towards a partner. Individual variation in the strength of this functional connectivity, particularly after the first mating encounter, predicts how quickly animals begin affiliative huddling with their partner. Rhythmically activating this circuit in a social context without mating biases later preference towards a partner, indicating that this circuit’s activity is not just correlated with how quickly animals become affiliative but causally accelerates it. These results provide the first dynamic view of corticostriatal activity during bond formation, revealing how social interactions can recruit brain reward systems to drive changes in affiliative behaviour.

 As key executers of biological functions, the activity and abundance of proteins are subjected to extensive regulation. Deciphering the genetic architecture underlying this regulation is critical for understanding cellular signalling events and responses to environmental cues. Using random mutagenesis in haploid human cells, we apply a sensitive approach to directly couple genomic mutations to protein measurements in individual cells. Here we use this to examine a suite of cellular processes, such as transcriptional induction, regulation of protein abundance and splicing, signalling cascades (mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), protein kinase B (AKT), interferon, and Wingless and Int-related protein (WNT) pathways) and epigenetic modifications (histone crotonylation and methylation). This scalable, sequencing-based procedure elucidates the genetic landscapes that control protein states, identifying genes that cause very narrow phenotypic effects and genes that lead to broad phenotypic consequences. The resulting genetic wiring map identifies the E3-ligase substrate adaptor KCTD5 (ref. 1) as a negative regulator of the AKT pathway, a key signalling cascade frequently deregulated in cancer. KCTD5-deficient cells show elevated levels of phospho-AKT at S473 that could not be attributed to effects on canonical pathway components. To reveal the genetic requirements for this phenotype, we iteratively analysed the regulatory network linked to AKT activity in the knockout background. This genetic modifier screen exposes suppressors of the KCTD5 phenotype and mechanistically demonstrates that KCTD5 acts as an off-switch for GPCR signalling by triggering proteolysis of Gβγ heterodimers dissociated from the Gα subunit. Although biological networks have previously been constructed on the basis of gene expression, protein–protein associations, or genetic interaction profiles, we foresee that the approach described here will enable the generation of a comprehensive genetic wiring map for human cells on the basis of quantitative protein states.

 Microorganisms are often studied as populations but the behaviour of single, individual cells can have important consequences. For example, tuberculosis, caused by the bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, requires months of antibiotic therapy even though the bulk of the bacterial population dies rapidly. Shorter courses lead to high rates of relapse because subpopulations of bacilli can survive despite being genetically identical to those that are easily killed. In fact, mycobacteria create variability each time a cell divides, producing daughter cells with different sizes and growth rates. The mechanism(s) that underlie this high-frequency variation and how variability relates to survival of the population are unknown. Here we show that mycobacteria actively create heterogeneity. Using a fluorescent reporter and a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based transposon screen, we find that deletion of lamA, a gene of previously unknown function, decreases heterogeneity in the population by decreasing asymmetric polar growth. LamA has no known homologues in other organisms, but is highly conserved across mycobacterial species. We find that LamA is a member of the mycobacterial division complex (the ‘divisome’). It inhibits growth at nascent new poles, creating asymmetry in polar growth. The kinetics of killing individual cells that lack lamA are more uniform and more rapid with rifampicin and drugs that target the cell wall. Our results show that mycobacteria encode a non-conserved protein that controls the pattern of cell growth, resulting in a population that is both heterogeneous and better able to survive antibiotic pressure.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Similar to resting mature B cells, where the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) controls cellular survival, surface BCR expression is conserved in most mature B-cell lymphomas. The identification of activating BCR mutations and the growth disadvantage upon BCR knockdown of cells of certain lymphoma entities has led to the view that BCR signalling is required for tumour cell survival. Consequently, the BCR signalling machinery has become an established target in the therapy of B-cell malignancies. Here we study the effects of BCR ablation on MYC-driven mouse B-cell lymphomas and compare them with observations in human Burkitt lymphoma. Whereas BCR ablation does not, per se, significantly affect lymphoma growth, BCR-negative (BCR−) tumour cells rapidly disappear in the presence of their BCR-expressing (BCR+) counterparts in vitro and in vivo. This requires neither cellular contact nor factors released by BCR+ tumour cells. Instead, BCR loss induces the rewiring of central carbon metabolism, increasing the sensitivity of receptor-less lymphoma cells to nutrient restriction. The BCR attenuates glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) activity to support MYC-controlled gene expression. BCR− tumour cells exhibit increased GSK3β activity and are rescued from their competitive growth disadvantage by GSK3β inhibition. BCR− lymphoma variants that restore competitive fitness normalize GSK3β activity after constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, commonly through Ras mutations. Similarly, in Burkitt lymphoma, activating RAS mutations may propagate immunoglobulin-crippled tumour cells, which usually represent a minority of the tumour bulk. Thus, while BCR expression enhances lymphoma cell fitness, BCR-targeted therapies may profit from combinations with drugs targeting BCR− tumour cells.

 Two distinct forms of natural selection promote adaptive biological diversity. Divergent selection occurs when different environments favour different phenotypes, leading to increased differences between populations. Negative frequency-dependent selection occurs when rare variants within a population are favoured over common ones, increasing diversity within populations. These two diversifying forces promote genetic variation at different spatial scales, and may act in opposition, but their relative effects remain unclear because they are rarely measured concurrently. Here we show that negative frequency-dependent selection within populations can favor rare immigrants over locally adapted residents. We reciprocally transplanted lake and stream ecotypes of threespine stickleback into lake and stream habitats, while manipulating the relative abundance of residents versus immigrants. We found negative frequency-dependence: survival was highest for the locally rare ecotype, rather than natives. Also, individuals with locally rare major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class IIb genotypes were infected by fewer parasites. This negative frequency-dependent selection will tend to favour rare immigrants over common residents, amplifying the effect of migration and undermining the efficacy of divergent natural selection to drive population differences. The only signal of divergent selection was a tendency for foreign fish to have higher parasite loads than residents, after controlling for MHC genotype rarity. Frequency-dependent ecological interactions have long been thought to promote speciation. Our results suggest a more nuanced view in which negative frequency dependence alters the fate of migrants to promote or constrain evolutionary divergence between populations.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Diarrhoeal disease is responsible for 8.6% of global child mortality. Recent epidemiological studies found the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium to be a leading cause of paediatric diarrhoea, with particularly grave impact on infants and immunocompromised individuals. There is neither a vaccine nor an effective treatment. Here we establish a drug discovery process built on scalable phenotypic assays and mouse models that take advantage of transgenic parasites. Screening a library of compounds with anti-parasitic activity, we identify pyrazolopyridines as inhibitors of Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis. Oral treatment with the pyrazolopyridine KDU731 results in a potent reduction in intestinal infection of immunocompromised mice. Treatment also leads to rapid resolution of diarrhoea and dehydration in neonatal calves, a clinical model of cryptosporidiosis that closely resembles human infection. Our results suggest that the Cryptosporidium lipid kinase PI(4)K (phosphatidylinositol-4-OH kinase) is a target for pyrazolopyridines and that KDU731 warrants further preclinical evaluation as a drug candidate for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis.

&lt;p&gt;Openness to Experience is one of the so-called Big Five personality traits and, among other things, it’s associated with being more creative, curious and appreciative of the arts. Like all the traits, where you score has important implications – for instance, there’s recent evidence that being more Open is associated with having more “cognitive reserve”, which gives you protection from the harmful effects of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Openness correlates with, but is distinct from, intelligence, and psychologists are trying to find out more about what the basis of Openness is at a cognitive and neural level. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656617300338?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Research in Personality&lt;/em&gt; shows that the trait runs deep, even affecting a very basic aspect of visual perception. It seems Open people literally see the world differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24155&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anna Antinori and her colleagues asked 134 undergrad students to perform a binocular rivalry task, which involves two different images being presented separately to each eye. The brain usually deals with this clash by alternately suppressing the images, which leads to the subjective experience of seeing one image then the other, back and forth. Occasionally, the perception of the two images can meld together and the researchers were interested in whether this experience correlates with the personality trait of Openness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what they found. They presented their participants with a red striped pattern to one eye and a green pattern to the other simultaneously for two minutes, and asked participants to press keyboard keys to indicate what they could see from one moment to the next, whether the red pattern, the green, or a mixture of the two. Those participants who scored higher on a questionnaire measure of Openness to Experience (they agreed with items like “I need a creative outlet”) experienced a “mixed percept” a greater amount of time than lower scorers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers don’t think this is a simple response bias – that is, having a lower threshold for saying when the image seemed mixed – because the personality link disappeared when they used larger stimuli that are known to increase the experience of a mixed percept (if there is a personality-related response bias, you’d expect it to occur again with the bigger stimuli). In a final experiment, the researchers showed that inducing positive mood, via an imagination task and music, increased the mixed percept experience especially for higher scorers in Openness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We provided the first evidence that individuals reporting greater openness to experience may also have characteristically different low-level visual perceptual experiences,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They think the same neural processes may underlie this visual effect and previous behavioural findings related to Openness, such as that it correlates with superior divergent thinking skills. The precise nature of these neural processes awaits further investigation, but for now a clue may come from the fact that the psychedelic compound psilocybin (found in magic mushrooms) also increases the experience of mixed percepts during binocular rivalry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656617300338?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email&quot;&gt;Seeing it both ways: Openness to experience and binocular rivalry suppression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/05/29/the-neuroanatomy-of-gossips/"/>

		<updated>2017-05-29T15:30:32+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;We talk a lot. We are the only species on the planet that exchange information predominantly through talking. Other species, such as dolphins or primates, have their own languages, but they do not rely on verbal communication to the same degree, almost to the exclusion of other communication channels, as we do. Verbal communication is a cornerstone of our society. So what are we talking about so much? According to scientific research, we talk mostly about other people. In fact, a whopping two-thirds of our conversations consist of gossips. Of course, we discuss other things such as work, politics, sports, and weather, but overwhelmingly we talk about other people’s affairs, often not in a very positive light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific statistics on gossiping came as a surprise to me: what the intelligent, sensible and, as a rule, genuinely compassionate people around me would gain from spending so much time on gossips? I always believed that I almost never &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2008/01/02/the-purpose-of-rumors/&quot;&gt;gossip&lt;/a&gt;. But when I tried to recall the topics of recent conversations with my friends, I have to admit that discussing other people does indeed take the lion’s share of what we talk about. Gossiping might be just a reflection of curiosity that all humans possess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, according to psychologists and evolutionary scientists, gossiping plays a key role in societal cohesion by spreading reputational information. The studies show that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals readily communicate reputational information about others, and recipients used this information to selectively interact with cooperative individuals and ostracize those who had behaved selfishly, which enabled group members to contribute to the public good with reduced threat of exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, gossips mitigate egoistic behavior and counteract possible incentives to exploit the cooperative tendencies of others. They also serve to protect vulnerable members of society. Not bad!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term “gossip” tends to have a negative connotation. Cambridge Dictionary defines gossip as conversation or reports about other people’s private lives that might be unkind, disapproving, or not true. Typically, the information shared via gossips is not substantiated by hard evidence. Although gossips are indeed often negative (and we will see below why we find negative gossiping more engaging), we do often talk about positive aspects of other people’s behavior too. We simply don’t view this kind of information sharing as gossiping. Negative gossiping might require a degree of secrecy (i.e., the subjects of the gossips are not informed about the fact that they were discussed – we talk about them behind their back). Unsurprisingly, people do not like when they find that they are being gossiped about, and hence there is a moral stigma attached to the people who are gossiping too much. However, more often than not, the gossips are not entirely negative – they tend to be a mixture of both positive and negative things. We provide other people with our assessment of another person’s reputation as we see it, typically involving both the person’s strengths and weaknesses, and with only limited evidence to substantiate either. These assessments might still be viewed unfavorably by the subjects of gossips, even when the assessment is predominantly positive.  Nonetheless, we accept positive assessments with pleasure, but tend to be annoyed by criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being social creatures, we pay lots of attention to the opinion of others about us. Positive assessments by others are associated with higher social status, a larger number of friends and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2010/03/06/why-some-human-brains-become-leaders-while-others-followers/&quot;&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt;, and better chances of succeeding in any new venture and finding and attracting the best mating partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part of the brain responsible for our social behavior is the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is involved in social cognition and executive control. Social cognition refers to our ability to regulate our behavior and actions based on the real or assumed presence of other people. This is a trait that makes some want to conform to the norms and rules of society in which we live. Executive control channels our actual behavior and thoughts in the desirable direction. Studies with the use of functional MRI brain scans revealed the patterns of activation in the prefrontal cortex in response to positive and negative gossip about themselves, their best friends, and celebrities. A very interesting and revealing picture has emerged from these studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two separate areas of the prefrontal cortex get activated in response to &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/04/25/how-does-the-brain-respond-to-gossip/&quot;&gt;positive and negative gossip&lt;/a&gt;: positive gossip activates the orbital prefrontal cortex region, while negative gossip activates the superior medial prefrontal cortex. The intensity of responses was, however, very different depending on whether the gossip was about the subject of study or other people. Substantial activation of the superior medial prefrontal cortex was observed in both cases, regardless of the subject of the negative gossip. The orbital prefrontal cortex region was highly activated by positive gossip about the subjects themselves. However, this response was rather muted when the subjects listened to positive gossip about their friends or celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study revealed volumes about the internal processes in our brain. It is quite clear that our ego makes us very attentive to any kind of information about ourselves passed around by other people. However, when it comes to information about others, we are biased to notice and register negative information preferentially. No wonder that the stories of scandals involving celebrities attract more attention than anything good these people do! Our own neuroanatomy makes celebrity magazines filled with the stories of scandals, cheating, and divorces, much more popular that magazines about happy family life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In 2010, the former PhD supervisor of Sven Hendrix, a neuroanatomist at Hasselt University in Belgium, was accused of misconduct. Although the allegations were eventually dropped, the experience was emotionally and professionally draining – and Hendrix wanted the research community to know about it. In 2015, he shared his story at a conference in Rotterdam; […]&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 ABCG2 is a constitutively expressed ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that protects many tissues against xenobiotic molecules. Its activity affects the pharmacokinetics of commonly used drugs and limits the delivery of therapeutics into tumour cells, thus contributing to multidrug resistance. Here we present the structure of human ABCG2 determined by cryo-electron microscopy, providing the first high-resolution insight into a human multidrug transporter. We visualize ABCG2 in complex with two antigen-binding fragments of the human-specific, inhibitory antibody 5D3 that recognizes extracellular loops of the transporter. We observe two cholesterol molecules bound in the multidrug-binding pocket that is located in a central, hydrophobic, inward-facing translocation pathway between the transmembrane domains. Combined with functional in vitro analyses, our results suggest a multidrug recognition and transport mechanism of ABCG2, rationalize disease-causing single nucleotide polymorphisms and the allosteric inhibition by the 5D3 antibody, and provide the structural basis of cholesterol recognition by other G-subfamily ABC transporters.

&lt;p&gt;A new paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/qxaby&quot;&gt;in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/a&gt; has taken a hard look at psychology’s crisis of replication and research quality and we’re covering its findings in two parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/25/was-the-crisis-in-social-psychology-really-that-bad-have-things-improved-part-one-the-researchers-perspective/&quot;&gt;Part One, published yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, we reported the views of active research psychologists on the state of their field, as surveyed by Matt Motyl and his colleagues at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Researchers reported a cautious optimism: research practices hadn’t been as bad as feared, and are in any case improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is their optimism warranted? After all, &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716&quot;&gt;several high-profile&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://https//osf.io/ct89g/wiki/home/&quot;&gt;replication projects&lt;/a&gt; have found that, more often than not, re-running previously successful studies produces only null results. But defenders of the state of psychology argue that replications fail for many reasons, including defects in the reproduction and differences in samples, so the implications aren’t settled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get closer to the truth, Motyl’s team complemented their survey findings with a forensic analysis of published data, uncovering results that seem to bolster their optimistic position. In Part Two of our coverage, we look at these findings and why they’re already proving controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24126&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motyl and his colleagues used a relatively new type of analysis to assess the quality and honesty of the data found in over 500 previously published papers in social psychology. Their approach is technical, involving weirdly-named statistics conducted upon even more statistics, so it helps to use an analogy: Just as a vegetable garden produces a variety of tomatoes, some bigger than others, some misshapen, some puny and poor for eating, an honestly-conducted body of research should bear a range of fruit in the same way. True experimental effects shouldn’t always come out exactly the same: they should vary in size from experiment to experiment, including instances when the effect is too small to be statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the sorts of things you can evaluate in a body of research – in this case with the &lt;i&gt;Test for Insufficient Variance,&lt;/i&gt; which Motyl’s study used alongside six other indices. When there were too many irregularities in the data, or bizarre regularity like identikit supermarket tomatoes, this suggested to Motyl and his colleagues that questionable research practices may have been used to make the weak results swell up to reach the desired appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, however, the study found that more often than not, the indices showed low levels of anomalies, suggesting research practices are more likely to be acceptable than questionable. This was the case for studies from 2003-4, before the crisis was fully acknowledged, and the researchers found an even better picture for more recent (2013-14) papers. The fruits of the research may have been tampered with from time to time, but there was no case that the entire enterprise was “rotten to the core”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This optimistic conclusion conflicts with similar analyses performed in the past, but this might be explained by the different approaches of collecting the data – of gathering the fruit, if you will. Past approaches automatically scraped articles for every instance of a statistic, such as every listed p-value. But this is like a bulldozer ripping out a corner of a garden and measuring everything that looks anything like a tomato, including stones and severed gnome-heads. To take just one example, articles will often list p-values for manipulation checks: confirmations that an experimental condition was set up correctly (did participants agree that the violent kung-fu clip was more violent than the video of grass growing?). But these aren’t tests to determine new scientific knowledge, rather – turning to another analogy – the equivalent of a chemist checking their equipment works before running an experiment. So Motyl’s team took a more nuanced approach, reading through every article and picking out by hand only the relevant statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, all is not rosy in the garden. At their Datacolada blog, “state of science” researchers Joseph Simmons, Leif Nelson, and Uri Simonsohn, have already responded to the new analysis and &lt;a href=&quot;http://datacolada.org/60&quot;&gt;they’re sceptical&lt;/a&gt;. Simmons and co first note the daunting scale of the new enterprise: to correctly identify 1800 relevant test statistics from 500 papers. In an online response, Motyl’s team &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/7jz3f&quot;&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; that yes, it was time consuming, and yes, it required a lot of hands: “there are reasons this paper has many authors: It really took a village,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Datacolada sampled some of the statistics that Motyl’s team used in their assessments and they argue that far too many of them were inappropriate, including data from manipulation checks that Motyl’s group had themselves categorised as &lt;i&gt;statistica non grata&lt;/i&gt;. To the Datacolada team, this renders the whole enterprise suspect: “We are in no position to say whether their conclusions are right or wrong. But neither are they.” In their response, Motyl’s team make some concessions, but they argue that some of the statistic selection comes down to difference of opinion, and defend both their overall  procedure, and the amount of coding errors they expect their study will contain. So….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So doing high-quality science isn’t straightforward. Neither is doing high-quality science on the quality of science, nor is gathering everything together to form high-quality conclusions. But if we care about the validity of the more sexy findings in psychology – the amazing powers of power poses to make you physically more confident, how you can hack your happiness simply by changing your face, and how even subtle social signals about age, race or gender can transform how we perform at tasks – we need to care about psychological science itself, how it’s working and how it isn’t. (By the way, those findings I just listed? &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/16/ten-famous-psychology-findings-that-its-been-difficult-to-replicate/&quot;&gt;They’ve all struggled to replicate&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are surely ways to to improve the methods of this new study – perhaps not coincidentally, Datacolada’s Leif Nelson is running a similar project – but even if the new assessment does include some irrelevant statistics, it will likely be an advance on past analyses that included &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; irrelevant statistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So … the new insights have budged my position on the state of science a little: I’m still worried, but I can see a little more light among the dark. Motyl’s group make the case that social psychology isn’t ruined, that the garden isn’t totally contaminated. I hope so. But it’s not hope on its own that will move our field forward, but research, debate, and making sense of the evidence. After all, psychology is too good to give up on.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/sis-and-snake-bigger-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serpents are perhaps one of the most unique reptiles on the planet, both in form and function. They have adapted to movement without legs, hunting mechanisms range from venomous fangs to suffocation, and a metabolism that can quickly adapt between feast and prolonged famine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the metabolic changes that take place within serpentine metabolism have long fascinated scientists, who work towards understanding how the snake body could undergo such rapid changes without harming the animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Burmese python in particular is an excellent model for physiological studies since it is such a large snake (in the wild averaging just over twelve feet) with a sturdy build. Full grown adults can go months between feeding, but then consume an entire goat or pig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most notable changes that take place within the Burmese python before and after they feed occur within their organ systems, with major organs such as the heart, liver and kidneys increasing in mass by 40-100% two days after consuming a meal. On a cellular level, their metabolism skyrockets to a 44-fold increase, with more then 100-fold increase in plasma triglyceride content in their blood stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten to fourteen days after the python has consumed a meal, these same organs undergo atrophy and shrink back down to pre-meal sizes and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a genomic perspective, transcriptional responses (as expected) are both rapid and massive in regards to both the magnitude of expression changes and in the number of genes with significant differential expression. Previous studies have indicated that these changes are likely a result of a conserved response to core signaling molecules, which in turn activate diverse, tissue-specific signaling cascades. However, the identity of these signaling molecules has not yet been discovered due to the sheer scale and abbreviated time frame within which these changes take place in the genome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audra Andrew and Blair Perry at the University of Texas, Arlington and colleagues have recently published &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3743-1?utm_content=buffer794ff&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_campaign=buffer&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Genomics&lt;/em&gt; in which they analyzed the genomic changes that take place within the heart, liver, kidneys, and small intestine of the Burmese python before, during, and just after feeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of particular interest was the LXR/RXR activation pathway, PI3K/AKT, and mTOR signaling involved in upregulating the growth processes of organs, and the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response pathways with regards to the stress response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted by taking groups of Burmese pythons, fasting them for 30 days, and then feeding them a meal equal to 25% of their body mass. Tissue sampling time points were 30 days post fasting, one day after being fed, and 4 days after being fed, and collected from the heart, liver, small intestine and kidney. The tissue samples were then run though NEB Next RNAseq to generate RNAseq libraries for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine pathway activation and regulatory molecule predictions, the authors annotated the full Burmese python transcription set with the orthologous human gene Ensembl identifiers. The program STEM was used to identify and visualize significant expression profiles for all genes within the samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once data on the full set of python genes was collected, the specific genetic effects over the time period were assessed, and changes in upregulation and regression were noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9028&quot; style=&quot;width: 510px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9028 size-full&quot; height=&quot;297&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/12864_2017_3743_Fig2_HTML.gif&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 2A from Andrew et al. 2017. Summary of significantly differentially expressed genes for all four organs identified via regression analysis. This Venn diagram depicts the numbers of genes significantly differentially expressed across time points. Darker colors indicate a large number of genes and lighter colors indicate a smaller number of genes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every organ studied, the majority of differentially expressed genes showed immediate up or down regulation within 24 hours post feeding. Each of the four organs examined experienced regression towards fasting levels of expression by four days post fasting to widely different extents, indicating that growth changes are unique between organ systems. Of all genes in the genome, only a single gene was identified as significant in all four organs across all time points: coagulation factor X (F10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After mapping the python genes to human orthologs, Andrew and colleagues were able to associate over 70% of human genes within the mTOR and NRF2 stress response pathway.  Both of these biological pathways appear to be involved in every organ system response to feeding, suggesting human tissue is likely to have developed in the same manner. Notably, insulin signaling represents a key-regulation factor of the mTOR pathway, and the activation of NRF2 may play additional roles in growth response, as its blood plasma contains factors that have been shown in vitro to cause resistance to apoptosis in mammalian cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this scale of hypertrophy, hyperplasia and atrophy are impressive in snakes, it is not a unique phenomenon in the animal kingdom, as other classes of animals – notably fish and amphibians – as well as plants express varying levels of organ and tissue growth and regeneration. However, the use of mTOR and NRF2-mediated signaling is unique to the Burmese python in both phenotype and genotype expression patterns, particularly the use of multiple coordinated growth pathways in multiple tissue types, suggesting a possible future mechanism to facilitate future human growth and organ repair.&lt;/p&gt;

That the word “truth” has no meaning any more? Does the existence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ToLfQU2xmg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;alternative facts&lt;/a&gt; make you question your own sanity? In modern usage, the term &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;gaslighting&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; refers to “a form of psychological abuse  in which false information is presented to the victim with the intent  of making him/her doubt his/her own memory and perception”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gaslighting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a form of manipulation  that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or members of  a group, hoping to make targets question their own memory, perception,  and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In December 2016, the amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/laurenduca&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lauren Duca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;wrote a widely shared piece for &lt;i&gt;Teen Vogue&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teenvogue.com/story/donald-trump-is-gaslighting-america&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Donald Trump Is Gaslighting America&lt;/a&gt;. In it, she argued that Trump won the election by normalizing deception. Duca noted that the term &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;gaslighting&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  originated from the 1938 play &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_Light&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gas Light&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Patrick Hamilton, and explained it in this way:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&quot;Gas lighting&quot; is a buzzy name for a terrifying strategy currently being used to weaken and blind the American electorate. We are collectively being treated like Bella Manningham in the 1938 Victorian thriller from which the term &quot;gas light&quot; takes its name. In the play, Jack terrorizes his wife Bella into questioning her reality by blaming her for mischievously misplacing household items which he systematically hides. Doubting whether her perspective can be trusted, Bella clings to a single shred of evidence: the dimming of the gas lights that accompanies the late night execution of Jack’s trickery. The wavering flame is the one thing that holds her conviction in place as she wriggles free of her captor’s control.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gaslighting in the Medical Literature&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4182427&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Barton and Whitehead (1969)&lt;/a&gt; were the first to report cases where a patient's mental state was manipulated for material (or situational) gain, calling it the “Gas-Light Phenomenon”. If these incidents sound like something straight out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://noirwich.co.uk/2017/04/12/the-origins-of-domestic-noir/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;domestic noir&lt;/a&gt; or a TV crime drama, you'd be right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Case 1&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; &lt;u&gt;48 year old mechanic, married for 10 years, with three children&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Mr. A. was admitted one evening to a psychiatric hospital as an emergency. His general practitioner, when asking for his admission, had said he was mentally ill and had attacked his wife. ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On admission the patient said he had felt tense and depressed for about six months and related this to his wife’s changed attitude towards him. He said she had become &quot;cold&quot;, and he thought she might have been seeing another man. He denied he had been violent and thought he had been sent into hospital because of his &quot;nerves&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;His wife had concocted an elaborate tale of abuse, saying he had become “irritable, bad-tempered, and liable to unprovoked violent outbursts in which he sometimes hit her and once struck her with a hatchet.” She also claimed his memory was deteriorating, and she categorically denied having an affair. Mr. A was hospitalized for 12 days with no obvious physical or psychiatric disorder and left feeling more relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, he returned to hospital two weeks later: “He said his wife had started taunting him, saying he was mad and should be in a mental hospital. His wife said that his mental condition had considerably worsened and that he had attacked her twice.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately for Mr. A, his boss overheard a conversation between two men in the local tavern. One of the men was Mrs. A's lover, discussing how the two of them had plotted to get rid of Mr. A using the false claims of mental illness and abuse. The hospital staff confronted Mrs. A with her lies:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;She finally agreed that she had plotted with her boy-friend to get rid of her husband, but claimed she had been led on by him and now very much regretted her behaviour. Following some family counselling Mr. and Mrs. A. became reconciled and five years later were still living &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_Girl_(film)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Gone Girl&quot;&gt;happily together&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Case 2&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; &lt;u&gt;45 year old pub owner married for 14 years&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. B was admitted based on his wife's story about her husband’s “heavy drinking, erratic behaviour, and aggressive outbursts.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;On admission to the unit Mr. B. gave a history of domestic difficulties and described mild symptoms of anxiety and depression. ...  He agreed that he was irritable but said that he had never been aggressive and did not acknowledge any of the common symptoms of alcoholism. ... recently ... his wife had lost interest in him and had started associating with younger men. She often stayed out all night, and when he asked her about this behaviour she told him not to be silly and accused him of being a drunk who should be put away.&lt;/blockquote&gt;A member of the staff eventually found out about Mrs. B's fabrication and her intent to get rid of her husband, keep the pub, and “then really start living.” Unlike the outcome of Case 1, Mr. B left his wife and was quite happy without her five years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Case 3&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; &lt;u&gt;72 year old widow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This case is unique, because it goes beyond mere mental manipulation. Mrs. C. was referred to a psychiatric hospital because of a &quot;confusional state&quot; and &quot;fecal incontinence&quot; that made her unfit for the old persons' home where she resided. She had moderate Parkinson's disease and slight dementia, but she was fairly well oriented and pleasant in demeanor. She stayed in the hospital for six weeks and showed no signs of fecal incontinence while there. And indeed it turned out that her incontinence had been cruelly induced by large doses of laxatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;The lady running the home had been unable to develop a good relationship with Mrs. C. and considered &quot;she was a naughty old thing making life difficult for me, my staff, and other folk on purpose&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some weeks before admission to hospital Mrs. C. had been receiving ’&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisacodyl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dulcolax&lt;/a&gt;’ tablets one three times a day. This had produced the expected effect with occasional &quot;accidents&quot; due to Mrs. C.’s mobility difficulties. The evidence suggested that Mrs. C. was not wanted in the home and induced incontinence was used as a method of getting her removed to hospital.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Case 4&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; Another example is an incident reported by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/588872&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lund and Gardiner (1977)&lt;/a&gt;, where the staff of the mental hospital conspired to keep a patient there so that one of them could live in her flat. The elderly woman had suffered from paranoid episodes in the past that were successfully treated with medication. But this time “they” were really out to get her:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Miss A., an 80-year-old retired professional lady&lt;/u&gt;, was first admitted to a mental hospital in connection with this incident under Section 31 of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1960, from her pleasant flat in a residential establishment. The admission notes stated that she had complained that there were people on the premises who had no business there, that they had spoken outside her door saying that they were going to throw her into the river and that she further believed that these people were 'after my flat'...&lt;/blockquote&gt;Miss A was shuttled in and out of hospital several times until the evil plot was finally foiled:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;She was admitted for the third time some four months later with a depressingly similar story. Her general practitioner had been called to the home where the patient had allegedly ' barricaded her room'; she had simply put a chair against the door. She was again admitted under an Emergency Order and once more settled down very rapidly, showing no sign of disturbed behaviour. She was generally pleasant and witty, showing some evidence of valuing her independence and mildly resenting the help of the nursing staff, which she regarded as unnecessary interference. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, suspicion about the motives of the staff at the institution were aroused. Discreet inquiries revealed that the rooms which Miss A occupied had been earmarked for a proposed additional member of staff...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[And the rental market has only gotten worse in the last 40 years!! So it's not surprising to see many stories emerging from trendy urban areas (and  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5a60w8/sc_landlord_refusing_repairs_gaslighting_creepy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;). For starters, you can read these anecdotes of landlord gaslighting and harassment from tenants in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/24/ask-about-tenant-landlord-issues/comment-page-4/#comment-33881&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ask.metafilter.com/291082/Reality-check-re-slow-bathtub-drain-on-the-third-floor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rossdonnagentry.jennylens.com/city-attorney-ignoring-my-pleas-for-help-now/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Santa Monica&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.expertlaw.com/forums/showthread.php?t=188848&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Case 5&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; Let's conclude with one final report from the &lt;i&gt;Canadian Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674378202700310&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kutcher (1982)&lt;/a&gt; described the sad case of &lt;u&gt;Mrs. N, a 59 year old financially successful woman&lt;/u&gt; who was referred to a psychiatrist at her husband's insistence. Marital problems were clearly the source of her distress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;About two years into the marriage she established Mr. N in a business as he had entered the relationship without a secure financial basis. She then noted he would stay away from home, be unavailable when she tried to contact him, tell her he was visiting with friends even though they denied any visits, and so forth. When she confronted him with these issues he denied any extramarital activity.  ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;Mr. N. wasn't terribly creative; his ruse was ripped from the pages of &lt;i&gt;Gaslight. &lt;/i&gt;An outside party described him as &quot;a 60 year old Cassanova who thinks he's 25.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Numerous friends often intimated that he was involved with another woman and Mrs. N eventually saw this for herself. When confronted, he denied it, then said it was all over and refused to discuss the matter further. He then complained about her &quot;saggy breasts&quot; and when she had surgery for reduction he ridiculed her.&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; He hid her jewelry and accused her of losing it, often changed times they were to meet without notifying her and berated her for being late; and told their acquaintances that she was &quot;going a little strange.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Unfortunately, Mrs. N's case was not a success story: “Currently she is still in therapy and as yet is unable to resolve the issue.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's hope the U.S. can collectively (and individually) regain its grip on the truth so it will not suffer a similar fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnote&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I think she's amazing for her persistence as a guiding voice on social media despite the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teenvogue.com/story/lauren-duca-internet-trolls-online-harassment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;grotesque harassment&lt;/a&gt; she's received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;OK, gaslighting has jumped the shark &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/wkjxzjGkyE&quot;&gt;https://t.co/wkjxzjGkyE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;— Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/laurenduca/status/862126177221316612&quot;&gt;May 10, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further Reading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/on-the-origins-of-gaslighting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;On the Origins of “Gaslighting”&lt;/a&gt; (by Rosemary Erickson Johnsen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tressiemc.com/essays-2/a-few-notes-on-gaslighting/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A Few Notes on Gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; (by Tressie McMillan Cottom)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Z3988&quot; title=&quot;ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Lancet+%28London%2C+England%29&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Apmid%2F4182427&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=The+gas-light+phenomenon.&amp;amp;rft.issn=0140-6736&amp;amp;rft.date=1969&amp;amp;rft.volume=1&amp;amp;rft.issue=7608&amp;amp;rft.spage=1258&amp;amp;rft.epage=60&amp;amp;rft.artnum=&amp;amp;rft.au=Barton+R&amp;amp;rft.au=Whitehead+JA&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Medicine%2CPsychology%2CPsychiatry&quot;&gt;Barton R, &amp;amp; Whitehead JA (1969).

This shook a large swathe of science, but the fires continue to burn especially fiercely in the fields of social and personality psychology, which marshalled its response through &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/toc/ppsa/7/6&quot;&gt;a 2012 special issue in Perspectives on Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt; that brought these concerns fully out in the open, discussing &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/16/ten-famous-psychology-findings-that-its-been-difficult-to-replicate/&quot;&gt;replication failure&lt;/a&gt;, publication biases, and how to reshape incentives to improve the field. The fire flared up again in 2015 with the publication of Brian Nosek and the Open Science Collaboration’s high-profile attempt to replicate 100 studies in these fields, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/&quot;&gt;which succeeded in only 36 per cent of cases&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, and to its credit, efforts to institute better safeguards like &lt;a href=&quot;https://cos.io/rr/&quot;&gt;registered reports&lt;/a&gt; have gathered pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how bad did things get, and have they really improved?&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/qxaby&quot;&gt;new article&lt;/a&gt; in pre-print at the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/i&gt; tries to tackle the issue from two angles: first by asking active researchers what they think of the past and present state of their field, and how they now go about conducting psychology experiments, and second by analysing features of published research to estimate the prevalence of broken practices more objectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper comes from a large group of authors at the University of Illinois at Chicago under the guidance of Linda Skitka, a distinguished social psychologist who participated in the creation of the journal &lt;i&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/i&gt; and who is on the editorial board of many more social psych journals, and led by Matt Motyl, a social and personality psychologist who has published with Nosek in the past, including on the issue of improving scientific practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology research is the air that we breathe at the Digest, making it crucial that we understand its quality. So in this two-part series, we’re going to explore the issues raised in the University of Illinois at Chicago paper, to see if we can make sense of the state of social psychology, beginning in this post with the findings from Motyl et al’s survey of approximately 1,200 social and personality psychologists, from graduate students to full professors, mainly from the US, Europe and Australasia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-24095&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motyl’s team began by asking their participants about the state of the field now as opposed to 10 years ago. On average, participants believed that older research would only replicate in 40 per cent of cases – quite close to Nosek’s figure – but they believed that research being conducted now would have a better rate, about 50 per cent, and that generally the field was improving itself in response to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motyl’s team also canvassed the respondents on a range of questionable research practices, sketchy behaviours like neglecting to report all the measures taken, or quietly dropping experimental conditions from your study. Thanks particularly to work by Joseph Simmons, Leif Nelson, and Uri Simonsohn, we understand just how much these practices compromise the assumptions of scientific significance testing, making it easy to produce false positive results even in the absence of fraudulent intent. In their words, QRPs are not wrong “in the way it’s wrong to jaywalk”, the way that researchers have often implicitly been encouraged to think of them, but “wrong the way it’s wrong to rob a bank.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous surveys of researchers’ own QRP usage have uncovered high levels of admissions, as if the field was rushing to the confession box to purge their sins. Here, Motyl’s team used finer-grained questioning to look at frequency (often a “yes” turned out to be “rarely” or “once”) and justification. In some cases, a researcher’s justification showed that they had misinterpreted the question and that they were actually expressing strong disapproval of the QRP – in fact, this seemed to be the case in virtually all “confessions” of data fabrication. In other cases, the context provided by a justification painted the particular research practice in a completely different light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, consider the seemingly dodgy decision to drop conditions from your study analysis. If your rationale is that the condition didn’t turn out to do what you want to do – in an emotion and memory study, your sad video didn’t produce a sad mood in participants, for instance – it’s actually more problematic to keep what is effectively a bogus condition in your analysis than it is to exclude it (ideally in a principled way according to a registered procedure). For the new survey, independent judges evaluated all the stated justifications, and felt they legitimised the “questionable” practices in 90 per cent of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovering these misunderstandings and justifiable practices littered through the QRP data led Motyl’s team to conclude that pre-explosion psychology practices aren’t as derelict as once feared, although the fact that 70 per cent respondents said they are now less likely to engage in many of these practices than ten years ago suggests that all was not entirely virtuous back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So not perfect, but getting better, is the take within the field: a cautious optimism compared to some dire pronouncements on the state of psychology. In Part  Two, we’ll look at the body of psychological research itself, to see if this optimism is justified.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/beer-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Public Health England (PHE), alcohol is now the leading risk factor for ill-health, early mortality and disability among those aged 15 to 49 in England. It wants to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-matters-harmful-drinking-and-alcohol-dependence/health-matters-harmful-drinking-and-alcohol-dependence&quot;&gt;prevent and reduce&lt;/a&gt;” the harms caused by alcohol. It also has ambitions to create “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-matters-smoking-and-quitting-in-england/smoking-and-quitting-in-england&quot;&gt;a tobacco-free generation&lt;/a&gt;” by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent figures from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://natcen.ac.uk/our-research/research/survey-of-smoking,-drinking-and-drug-use-among-young-people-in-england/&quot;&gt;Survey of Smoking, Drinking and Drug Use Among Young People in England&lt;/a&gt; show that around 90,000 children aged between 11 and 15 are regular smokers and 240,000 have drunk alcohol in the past week. These figures are the lowest they have been since the survey began in 1982.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-2847-x&quot;&gt;recent research published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by colleagues at UCL, shows that around one in seven 11 year-olds is drinking alcohol and that having peers who consume alcohol makes them four times more likely to drink that their peers who don’t. We also know that smokers start young, two thirds of them before the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we wanted to examine more closely the sorts of things that might drive young people away from cigarettes and alcohol. In this way we hope to arm policy makers, health practitioners and those working directly with or caring for children and young people with information that can help with the development of clear policies and interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We focused on three factors thought to play a protective role in preventing young people from starting to smoke and drink. These were: their awareness of the harms, their well-being or happiness and how supportive their networks of friends and family were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information came from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk&quot;&gt;Understanding Societ&lt;/a&gt;y, a large UK survey, which, in addition to collecting a wide range of social and economic information from everyone in the household aged 16 and over, has a special self-completion questionnaire for 10-15 year olds. Our sample contained 1,729 boys and girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We examined answers at two time points (approximately a year apart) to questions about their smoking and drinking. With these two sets of information, we were able to see whether they had started but then stopped smoking or drinking, whether they were persistent users of cigarettes and alcohol, whether they had started between the first and second surveys (initiation) or whether they had not smoked or drunk alcohol at either point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children were also asked about how happy they were with different aspects of their lives, including how they were getting on at school, how they felt about their appearance, family and friends and life in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a scale of 1-4, the children were asked to rate how risky they thought different levels of smoking and drinking were. They were also asked how many supportive friends they had; friends they could confide in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harm awareness and happiness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 70 per cent of the study participants described themselves as persistent non-users of alcohol and cigarettes, and around 13 per cent categorized themselves as persistent users. Persistent non-users scored highest on harm awareness and happiness tests compared to the other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 8 per cent of the study group labelled themselves as ex-users and about 13 per cent had started using alcohol or cigarettes between the first and second time they completed the survey. Young people aged 10 to 12 were more likely to be in the persistent non-use group, whereas participants aged 13 and above were more likely to be in the persistent user and initiation groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were surprised that while, for most young people, knowledge of the potential and actual harms of alcohol and smoking was linked with them never drinking or smoking, for some it seemed to be associated with them starting to drink or smoke. It is possible that positive expectations from drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes may, in some way, have overridden their awareness of what harm they could do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The happier the young person was, and more aware of the harms of alcohol and cigarettes, the more likely they were never to drink or smoke. Having supportive friends to confide in did not play a role in preventing adolescents from using alcohol or cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promoting happiness and harms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems that promoting young people’s happiness and well-being and making them aware of the harms of smoking and drinking may be key to keeping them away from alcohol and cigarettes. In terms of possible timings for information and interventions, another takeaway from the study might be that working with children between the ages of 10 and 12, before they start trying cigarettes and alcohol, could be important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the information used in this study is self-reported, we need to interpret the findings with caution, but they do suggest that making adolescents aware of alcohol and smoking related harm can be helpful in preventing them from engaging in risky health behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colleagues at the Centre are now getting to grips with the new age 14 data from the Millennium Cohort Study and, in collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;http://mentoruk.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Mentor&lt;/a&gt;, a charity working on the ground in schools to tackle alcohol and drug abuse, are hoping to develop our growing body of evidence in this area that will help formulate policies and activities to make some of Public Health England’s ambitions around smoking and alcohol a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
