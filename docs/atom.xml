&lt;p&gt;It’s a question that goes to the heart of human nature – do our personalities change through life or stay essentially the same? You might think psychology would have a definitive answer, but this remains an active research question. This is partly because of the practical challenge of testing the same group of individuals over many years. Now a major new contribution to the topic has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/ryjpc/&quot;&gt;made available online at the PsyArXiv repository&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers, led by Eileen Graham at Northwestern University, have compared and combined data from 14 previously published longitudinal studies, together involving nearly 50,000 participants from the US, Europe and Scandinavia. Their findings confirm and extend existing knowledge, showing how personality traits tend to change through life in predictable ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33002&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham and her colleagues started by looking for existing long-term studies into health and ageing that had captured data on at least one of the Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) on at least three separate occasions among the same sample of people. Although these long-term term studies measured personality, previous investigators hadn’t necessarily looked at this aspect of their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the identified studies that met the required criteria were the Einstein Aging Study, the Midlife in the United States study, The Berlin Aging Study, The Lothian Birth Cohort and the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging. In some cases, personality data was collected from the same individuals over several decades. There was a bias in the included studies toward testing people late in life, but this helps counterbalance existing studies of lifetime personality change which have been skewed toward younger participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining data from all the studies showed that four of the five main personality traits showed statistically significant change, on average, through life, thus contradicting William James’ famous assertion that personality is set like plaster after age 30. The exception was trait Agreeableness (related to warmth and empathy), but actually this trait was found to change in each individual study, but in different directions for different studies (sometimes increasing through life, sometimes diminishing), such that it appeared stable when considered in aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting Agreeableness aside, the overall pattern was for the other traits to decline across the lifespan by about 1-2 per cent per decade, such that participants became, on average, more emotionally stable (save for an uptick in Neuroticism at the very end of life), but generally less outgoing, less open-minded, and less orderly and self-disciplined. This is somewhat consistent with the previously described Dolce Vita (literally “sweet life”) effect, which describes how we change in late life in response to having fewer responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s worth reiterating that there was a bias in the included studies towards older samples. Focusing on just those studies with younger participants also provided evidence for early life increases in Conscientiousness, Extraversion and Openness (with peaks occurring in mid-life), which is consistent with another established theory known as the “maturity principle”, which states that our personalities tend to improve through life as we adapt to the growing challenges of work and family responsibilities (the observed declines in Neuroticism also fit this picture).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember these findings relate to sample averages, based on how personality trait levels were seen to change when data from all participants was combined. Consistent with past research, results from 12 of the 14 analysed studies revealed a good deal of individual variation in these patterns. As Graham and her colleagues put it, “not everyone changes at the same rate, or in the same direction”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also some intriguing hints at how these personality dynamics might vary across cultures. Specifically, the US samples showed more marked and consistent declines in Extraversion through life compared with European samples. The researchers interpreted this as US citizens becoming less inclined with age to conform to the strong pressure in American culture to behave like an extravert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings leave many questions about personality change unanswered, such as why some people show trait changes that don’t fit with the usual pattern. However, this paper’s most important contribution is probably to show how sub-fields like this, which depend on challenging, hard-to-repeat, long-term studies, can respond to the so-called replication crisis in psychology. It’s fairly easy to re-run a simple laboratory task with students, it’s much harder to try to replicate the findings of a decades-long personality change study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any one of the 14 samples used here could have comprised a publication on its own,” Graham and her colleagues explained, “with some claiming a given increase, other claiming a decrease, and still others arguing that a trait does not change at all. This has the potential to sow great confusion … However, when considered as a group with other samples, a fuller picture emerges.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/01/PLOS_fMRI-2-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional MRI (fMRI) is one of the most celebrated tools in neuroscience. Because of their unique ability to peer directly into the living brain while an organism thinks, feels and behaves, fMRI studies are often devoted disproportionate media attention, replete with flashy headlines and often grandiose claims. However, the technique has come under a fair amount of criticism from researchers questioning the validity of the statistical methods used to analyze fMRI data, and hence the reliability of fMRI findings. Can we trust those flashy headlines claiming that “scientists have discovered the &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;insert political affiliation, emotion or personality trait&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt; area of the brain,” or are the masses of fMRI studies plagued by statistical shortcomings? To explore why these studies can be vulnerable to experimental failure, in their new &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0184923&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS One study&lt;/a&gt; coauthors Henk Cremers, Tor Wager and Tal Yarkoni investigated common statistical issues encountered in typical fMRI studies, and proposed how to avert them moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FMRI simulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reliability of any experiment depends on adequate power to detect real effects and reject spurious ones, which can be influenced by various factors including the sample size (or number of “subjects” in fMRI), how strong the real effect is (“effect size”), whether comparisons are within or between subjects, and the statistical threshold used. To characterize common statistical culprits of fMRI studies, Cremers and colleagues first simulated typical fMRI scenarios before validating these simulations on a real dataset. One scenario simulated weak but diffusely distributed brain activity, and the other scenario simulated strong but localized brain activity (Figure 1). The simulation revealed that effect sizes are generally inflated for weak diffuse, compared to strong localized, activations, especially when the sample size is small. In contrast, effect sizes can actually be &lt;em&gt;underestimated&lt;/em&gt; for strong localized scenarios when the sample size is large. Thus, more isn’t always better when it comes to fMRI; the optimal sample size likely depends on the specific brain-behavior relationship under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_19500&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/01/WD_SL_Cremers2017.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-19500 size-large&quot; height=&quot;246&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/01/WD_SL_Cremers2017-1024x246.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;. Example “weak diffuse” and “strong localized” fMRI activations. Adapted from Cremers et al., 2017.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real data application: Human Connectome Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Cremers and colleagues analyzed a real fMRI dataset of nearly 500 subjects performing a social cognition task collected through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Human Connectome Project&lt;/a&gt;. To represent typical fMRI studies, random samples of 15 subjects were drawn to assess within-subject effects, and random samples of 30 subjects were used for between-subjects analyses. Results from these examples were compared to data from the full sample of 500 subjects—a rough proxy for true effects. Similar to the simulation, effect sizes negatively correlated with sample size, decreasing as the sample size grew. Because within-subject contrasts are by nature higher-powered, and because of the strong brain-behavior effect analyzed, real within-subject activations were readily detected even with the small sample of 15 individuals, resembling the simulated “strong localized” effects. In contrast, between-subject effects, even with twice the sample size, were unreliable and inflated, closely resembling the simulated “weak diffuse” scenario (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_19501&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/01/WD_examples_2017.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-19501 size-full&quot; height=&quot;499&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/01/WD_examples_2017.png&quot; width=&quot;930&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt;. Eight random subsamples of data (N = 30) from the Human Connectome Project, showing unreliable between-subject activations. Adapted from Cremers et al., 2017.&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings offer a few key take-away lessons. Underpowered studies can result in grossly overestimated effects and inconsistent activations, leading to an inability to replicate results. In part driven by a common fear of Type I errors (false positives), many studies miss legitimate effects and thus encourage incomplete or inaccurate inferences about brain-behavior relationships. Wager underscores that these pitfalls aren’t entirely unique to fMRI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having a healthy skepticism applies to most areas of science—genetics, animal models of disorders, psychology, and much more—not just fMRI. And I think skepticism should be &lt;em&gt;healthy&lt;/em&gt; skepticism—we can get provisionally excited about published ideas, and more excited about them as they pass the test of time and begin to be replicated across more groups. Publishing an exploratory finding that may not be true is not wrong, if you’ve made a good faith attempt to get at the truth—we just have to have patience and not ‘over-believe’ until the evidence comes in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding statistical pitfalls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can a neuroscientist do to adequately power their fMRI experiment to detect true effects while minimizing false or unreliable effects? A power analysis using realistic parameter estimates to compute the necessary sample size is a critical first step. Unfortunately, the requisite sample of fMRI data may be prohibitive in terms of time and money for an individual researcher without access to large datasets. The growing trend in “big data” may partially address this problem, but, as Wager explains, “it’s even more important to have ‘smart data.’ Large datasets can produce spurious results with high confidence in many cases where hidden causes are not properly accounted for. Smart data means careful sampling and analysis to improve inferences about what the real causes of effects are.” Once the data have been collected, a researcher can optimize their analysis by selecting the right balance between Type I (false positives) and Type II (false negatives) errors, which largely depends on the unique study scenario. Finally, the number of statistical comparisons can be limited by employing hypothesis-driven testing or by taking advantage of machine-learning, graph theory, or data reduction approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A movement to standardize fMRI methods has recently emerged, propelled by papers including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/files/2016/COBIDASreport.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the OHBM Committee on Best Practice in Data Analysis and Sharing (COBIDAS) on MRI&lt;/a&gt; and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18191585&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Guidelines for reporting an fMRI study&lt;/a&gt;.” According to Cremers, such efforts are “indeed essential, since there are so many choices to make when it comes to data acquisition and analyses. Also, initiatives like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/functional-mri&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Coursera fMRI course&lt;/a&gt; of Lindquist and Tor, are great and very important—they make the principles of fMRI research accessible to a wide audience.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, so few people contracted measles in England and Wales that the disease was declared &lt;a href=&quot;http://%3Chttps://www.nhs.uk/news/pregnancy-and-child/has-measles-really-been-eradicated-in-the-uk/&quot;&gt;technically “eliminated”&lt;/a&gt;. The national MMR (measles mumps rubella) vaccination programme is to thank. But set against this welcome news were some imperfect stats: in England in 2016/17, only 87.6 per cent of children had received both the required doses of the vaccine by their fifth birthday – a drop compared with the previous two years. At least part of the reason was a reluctance among some parents to have their children vaccinated. This is a problem that affects &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-vaccination-gaps-troubling-20170814-story.html&quot;&gt;other countries&lt;/a&gt;, and other vaccines, too. And it’s troubling, because clusters of unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children are more susceptible to disease outbreaks – indeed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/24/call-for-all-children-to-receive-mmr-vaccine-after-measles-outbreak&quot;&gt;a measles outbreak in Leeds and Liverpool just last year affected unprotected children&lt;/a&gt;, providing a reminder why all children should be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0256-5&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/i&gt;, a team led by Avnika Amin at Emory University, US, reveal a previously overlooked explanation for “vaccine hesitancy”, as it’s called – and it’s to do with parents’ basic moral values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32999&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent interventions designed to improve childhood vaccination rates have focused on providing parents with facts about vaccines. But while educational campaigns of this kind can be successful in the short term, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/02/23/the-backfire-effect-correcting-false-beliefs-about-vaccines-can-be-surprisingly-counterproductive/&quot;&gt;they can backfire,&lt;/a&gt; making some parents even less willing to vaccinate their children than they were before. This makes sense if you consider that parents’ decisions are not based only on the facts, but also on their moral values. By also addressing this influence on parents’ attitudes to vaccination, it may be possible to develop more effective interventions and help increase vaccination rates further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our moral values – the extent to which we prioritise loyalty or fairness, for example – are known to guide our decisions and behaviour in other areas, such as climate change and philanthropy. So the researchers reasoned that it made sense to look how they might influence attitudes towards vaccination. To do this, Amin and her colleagues surveyed 1,007 US parents of children aged under 13 about their attitudes to vaccination, and about their moral values, and looked to see if there was a connection between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost three quarters of parents fell into the “low hesitancy” category (they didn’t have a problem with vaccines); about 11 per cent were classed as “medium hesitancy” (they expressed concerns about vaccinations and had perhaps delayed their child’s vaccinations as a result); and 16 per cent were classed as “high hesitancy” (they had seriously delayed or even refused vaccinations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of their moral values, both medium and high-hesitancy parents were twice as likely as low-hesitancy parents to place a high emphasis on “purity” (one of six “moral foundations”, purity is associated with disapproval of acts that are deemed “disgusting” or “unnatural”). The high-hesitancy parents were also twice as likely as low-hesitancy parents to place a strong emphasis on liberty, which involves valuing individual freedom. They were also half as likely endorse obedience to authority. Belief in the importance of fairness (another moral foundation) was not related to vaccine hesitancy, and neither were gender or political ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second study, using a separate group of 464 parents, validated these findings. But the data from both studies only show a correlation between particular moral standpoints and attitudes towards childhood vaccinations, not a causal link. Nonetheless, the researchers said their results suggest that “health decisions are, to some extent, linked with moral concerns” and that there was promise in exploring the impact of health messages “framed using the moral foundations associated with medium or high hesitancy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, they suggested an intervention framed in terms of purity might read, “Boost your child’s natural defences against diseases! Keep your child pure of infections – Vaccinate!” A message framed in terms of liberty might read, “Take personal control of your child’s health! Vaccinations can help your child and others be free to lead a happy and healthy life!”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/Archaeopteryx_fossil-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;150 million years after Archaeopteryx roamed the earth; this bird-like dinosaur continues to be a source of fascination and debate. For over 100 years following its discovery in 1861, it had been considered the oldest known bird. Two years on from “On the Origin of Species”, the discovery of Archaeopteryx was well timed to provide physical evidence to support the theory of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archaeopteryx derives its name from the Greek terms for “ancient” and “wing”, reflecting its status as a touchstone for the evolutionary measurement of newly discovered ancient bird specimens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9739&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9739&quot; height=&quot;286&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/fossilpic-300x286.gif&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;The “Haarlem specimen”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Image taken from article&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in recent years, Archaeopteryx has been usurped from its throne as the only known Jurassic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraves&quot;&gt;paravian theropod&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to fossil material found across the globe. Theropods, a subgroup of dinosaurs could be recognised by their three toed limbs and hollow bones. In the late Jurassic era, the paraves evolved to form a clade. Among them, the avialans, are considered closely related to modern birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of fossils have recently been excavated from the Jurassic Tiaojishan Formation in eastern China. Anchiornis and Xiaotingia are now considered to belong to a clade that predates archaeopteryx, making them the oldest known paravian theropods identified so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archaeopteryx, was originally extracted from the Solnhofen Limestone, found in the German state of Bavaria. Currently Archaeopteryx remains the oldest paravian theropod reported outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, 12 skeletal specimens of Archaeopteryx have been identified.  However a new paper published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Evolutionary Biology&lt;/em&gt;, authored by Christian Foth and Oliver Rauhut, has cast doubt over the identity of one specimen currently located at the Teylers Museum in Haarlem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors then go further, proposing a new genus &lt;em&gt;Ostromia,&lt;/em&gt; of which the re-evaluated Haarlem specimen forms the species O. crassipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘Haarlem specimen’ comes in two pieces, with two separate parts of the same slab displaying the presence of feathers and bone markings including well preserved gastralia and feet. Overall, however, the Haarlem specimen is one of the least complete archaeopteryx specimens identified so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, Foth and Rauhut conducted a re-evaluation of the Haarlem specimen, using osteological analysis to conclude that a closer evolutionary relationship to the Chinese Anchiornis was more probable. The authors then go further, proposing a new genus &lt;em&gt;Ostromia,&lt;/em&gt; of which the re-evaluated Haarlem specimen forms the species O. crassipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not as old as its new Chinese relatives, the proposed new identity of the specimen provides clues on the distribution of species in the late Jurassic era. The authors argue for a radiation and dispersal of maniraptorian dinosaurs (including avialae) from eastern Asia. The high dispersal potential may have resulted in the evolutionary success of these species, particularly avian theropods: the ancestors of modern birds.&lt;/p&gt;

 Modern neuroscience has been accused of being a 'new phrenology', but now researchers have conducted a modern evaluation of phrenological claims using neuroscience methods.

In an enjoyable new preprint called An empirical, 21st century evaluation of phrenology, Oxford researchers Oiwi Parker Jones and colleagues say that they've rigorously tested, and debunked, phrenology for the first time.



Notoriously, the phrenologists believed that the shape of an individual's skull provided clues</content>

(2005)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other dementias are progressive neurodegenerative conditions that unfold over time. Subtle symptoms such as forgetfulness and word finding problems may progress to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673606685425&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mild cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; (MCI), and then escalate to full-blown dementia. Recent efforts to classify &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2881320/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Defining 'Prodromal' Alzheimer’s Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, and Lewy Body Dementia: Are we there yet?&quot;&gt;prodromal states&lt;/a&gt; have included automated analysis of spontaneous speech, which loses complexity as the disease progresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one study, &lt;strike&gt;Frazier&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JAD-150520&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fraser et al. (2015)&lt;/a&gt; applied machine learning methods to speech transcripts and audio files from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.talkbank.org/DementiaBank/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DementiaBank&lt;/a&gt; database. The participants were 167 patients with probable AD and 97 controls. The authors considered a total of 370 linguistic features, and found that a subset of 35 was able to classify patients vs. controls with 82% accuracy.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While an advance over previous studies, this is not yet useful for diagnostic purposes. Another limitation was the relatively short length of the speech samples.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using factor analysis, the researchers found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/2015/12/15/alzheimers-disease-markers-found-speech-patterns/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;four dimensions of speech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;were most indicative of dementia: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Semantic impairment&lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt; – &lt;/span&gt;using overly simple words&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acoustic impairment &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;e.g., speaking more  slowly &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Syntactic impairment  &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;using less complex grammar &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information impairment &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;not clearly identifying the main aspects  of a picture they were told to describe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Public figures who give repeated interviews leave a searchable record of spontaneous speech that can be analyzed for changes over time. Presidential press conferences provide another rich source of data for linguistic analysis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25633673&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Berisha et al. (2015)&lt;/a&gt; examined &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transcripts&lt;/a&gt; from the press conferences given by Ronald Reagan (1981-1989) and George H.W. Bush (1989-1993). We know that President Reagan received a formal diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in 1994, five years after leaving office. And as far as we know, the elder Bush is still cognitively intact for his age (he's 92 now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quantified linguistic features included:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Number of unique words&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-specific nouns – e.g., &lt;i&gt;thing, something, anything&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Filler words – &lt;i&gt;well, so, basically, actually, literally, um, ah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low-imageability, high frequency verbs &lt;i&gt;– e.g., &lt;i&gt;get, give, go, have, do&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reagan showed a significant decline in the number of unique words over the course of his presidency, but Bush did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W3MMHZEZQqg/WKloZbS7jEI/AAAAAAAAMB4/oJKTD80k2o0HFZLiepXi0dVUEKS43k6YACLcB/s1600/unique%2Bwords_linked%2Bto%2BAD%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;177&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W3MMHZEZQqg/WKloZbS7jEI/AAAAAAAAMB4/oJKTD80k2o0HFZLiepXi0dVUEKS43k6YACLcB/s400/unique%2Bwords_linked%2Bto%2BAD%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, Reagan showed a significant &lt;i&gt;increase&lt;/i&gt; in the use of non-specific nouns and fillers, but Bush did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L2r3dyRDBak/WKloZfPjJ4I/AAAAAAAAMB0/fbUHrn28BPgSlF1ZKIMXycTB1fMrDZN_wCLcB/s1600/non-specific%2Bnouns%2Band%2Bfillers%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;167&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L2r3dyRDBak/WKloZfPjJ4I/AAAAAAAAMB0/fbUHrn28BPgSlF1ZKIMXycTB1fMrDZN_wCLcB/s400/non-specific%2Bnouns%2Band%2Bfillers%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several caveats here. Reagan was 69 when he was elected, while Bush was 64. Reagan was president for eight years and Bush for only four years; yet Bush held over twice as many press conferences as Reagan. Nonetheless, the results are consistent with a decline in cognitive function (which is not uncommon when aging from 69 to 77). Can we can classify Reagan as having MCI on the basis of these results? I don't think so. We'd really need comparable data from a population of demographically matched elderly participants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;President Donald Trump&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/16/remarks-president-trump-press-conference&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Feb. 16 press conference&lt;/a&gt;, the public debate over whether President Trump is mentally unbalanced has intensified. Much of the current and past discussion has centered on the possibility of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Narcissistic Personality Disorder&lt;/a&gt; (NPD), as speculated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/the-mind-of-donald-trump/480771/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/11/donald-trump-narcissism-therapists&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/17/donald-trump-narcisissm-mentally-ill-personality?CMP=share_btn_tw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, Trump has many of these qualities (that predate his &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; grandiose status as POTUS): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grandiosity with expectations of superior treatment from others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixated on fantasies of power, success, intelligence, attractiveness, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Self-perception of being unique, superior and associated with high-status people and institutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Needing constant admiration from others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sense of entitlement to special treatment and to obedience from others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exploitative of others to achieve personal gain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unwilling to empathize with others' feelings, wishes, or needs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intensely envious of others and the belief that others are equally envious of them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pompous and arrogant demeanor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;And we can call him &lt;b&gt;narcissistic&lt;/b&gt; in the generic sense of the word. But do we need to diagnose him with a quasi-psychiatric disorder, as in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/opinion/mental-health-professionals-warn-about-trump.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;NY Times&lt;/i&gt; letter&lt;/a&gt; signed by 35 mental health professionals?&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Mr. Trump’s speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions. His words and behavior suggest a profound inability to empathize. Individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state, attacking facts and those who convey them (journalists, scientists).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a powerful leader, these attacks are likely to increase, as his personal myth of greatness appears to be confirmed. We believe that the grave emotional instability indicated by Mr. Trump’s speech and actions makes him incapable of serving safely as president.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Allen Frances, chair of the DSM-IV task force, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/opinion/an-eminent-psychiatrist-demurs-on-trumps-mental-state.html?_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;forcefully argued&lt;/a&gt; that Trump does not meet criteria for NPD, because he is not distressed by his behavior:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Mr. Trump causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has  been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity,  self-absorption and lack of empathy. It is a stigmatizing insult to the  mentally ill (who are mostly well behaved and well meaning) to be lumped  with Mr. Trump (who is neither).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discourse Analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here I'll suggest a different approach: can we quantify age-related neurological change using spontaneous speech?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;This is probably my favorite part so far &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/n61y5I8UrN&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/n61y5I8UrN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;— Rachel Riederer (@readerer) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/readerer/status/832303185826033664&quot;&gt;February 16, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“You know what uranium is, right?  It's this &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;thing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; called nuclear weapons  and other &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Like&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, lots of &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with uranium,  including some bad &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  Nobody talks about that.  I didn't &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; anything&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for Russia.  I've &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;done&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;nothing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for Russia.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most egregious example in the one hour, 17 minute &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct0H_ndjavM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;train wreck&lt;/a&gt;. But there are other signs. He used the construction “very, very” 20 times. The word “thing” (and its variants) was uttered 102 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Am I going to diagnose him with anything? Of course not. That's unethical!&lt;/b&gt; But I will say that since Mr. Trump has been a public figure for nearly 40 years, we can objectively analyze his spontaneous speech and quantify any changes over time. I must emphasize that there is no magical scale to use for classification or comparison purposes (at least not yet). We don't know what's normal age-related decline and what's pathological.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that the best corpus of spontaneous speech data is the collection of Trump interviews/conversations with David Letterman. I believe they're unscripted, and there are &lt;strike&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-mWCMiytLi0RV53IHrGXA/search?query=donald+trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=david+letterman+donald+trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; of them on YouTube (I've linked to eight below). Letterman has aged too, so you might as well analyze his speech as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The authors performed... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;...a 10-fold cross-validation procedure in which a unique 10% of the data (i.e., the ‘test set’) are used in each iteration for evaluation, and the remaining 90% (i.e., the ‘training set’) are used to select the most useful features (of the 370 available as described in “Features” above) and construct our models. The reported accuracy is an average across the 10 folds. In a given fold, data from any individual speaker can occur in the test set or the training set, but not both.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A show-stopping limitation is that the two groups were not matched for age or education. The mean age was 71.8 for AD vs. 65.2 for controls, and years of education 12.5 vs. 14.1 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; See also &lt;a href=&quot;https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/2015/12/15/alzheimers-disease-markers-found-speech-patterns/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s Disease Markers Found in Speech Patterns&lt;/a&gt; (link via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aholdenj/status/824801091007115268&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@aholdenj&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4 &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;BTW, they're not supposed to diagnose non-patients, that's unethical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Z3988&quot; title=&quot;ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Alzheimer%27s+Disease&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Apmid%2F25633673&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Tracking+discourse+complexity+preceding+Alzheimer%27s+disease+diagnosis%3A+a+case+study+comparing+the+press+conferences+of+Presidents+Ronald+Reagan+and+George+Herbert+Walker+Bush.&amp;amp;rft.issn=1387-2877&amp;amp;rft.date=2015&amp;amp;rft.volume=45&amp;amp;rft.issue=3&amp;amp;rft.spage=959&amp;amp;rft.epage=63&amp;amp;rft.artnum=&amp;amp;rft.au=Berisha+V&amp;amp;rft.au=Wang+S&amp;amp;rft.au=LaCross+A&amp;amp;rft.au=Liss+J&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Psychology%2CNeuroscience%2CCognitive+Psychology%2C+Language&quot;&gt;Berisha V, Wang S, LaCross A, &amp;amp; Liss J (2015).

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/01/4602242263_77fc03c1d1_o-1-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sensory environment contains multiple streams of information that must be efficiently processed and categorized by the CNS. Sound, for example, is transformed into neural signals in the cochlea, which are then transmitted and processed in the auditory brainstem, an ensemble of nuclei belonging to the efferent and afferent auditory systems. One particular region of the auditory brainstem, the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC), is known to integrate most ascending auditory information from lower brainstem regions, receiving inputs from several nuclei, including a prominent long-range inhibitory input from the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL). &lt;strong&gt;The ICC acts as an integrative station that is involved in the routing of multi-modal sensory perception&lt;/strong&gt;, controlling for example the startle response and the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The startle response is finely modulated by inhibitory inputs from the VNLL, which are classically considered to be glycinergic (Ono and Ito, 2015), and it is known that global lack of glycinergic neurotransmission in humans causes Startle Disease or Hyperekplexia (OMIM 149400), a rare neurological disorder characterized by an exaggerated startle reflex in response to acoustic or tactile stimuli, among other symptoms. Despite the role of glycinergic release from VNLL neurons is known, &lt;strong&gt;histological evidence suggests that these neurons may corelease glycine and GABA in the ICC&lt;/strong&gt;, which could be relevant for startle disease. However, functional evidence for glycine/GABA corelease has not been shown experimentally in this pathway, in part because ascending fibers from lower brainstem regions contain multiple sources of pure GABAergic inputs and electrical stimulation in these regions would activate these inputs, making it unfeasible to measure corelease from VNLL glycinergic fibers in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent study published in The Journal of Neuroscience, Moore and Trussell (2017) circumvented this limitation using optogenetics, which allowed them to control and selectively manipulate glycinergic neurons without co-activating surrounding ascending GABAergic axons. Glycinergic neurons uniquely express a presynaptic glycine transporter, GlyT2, which recycles glycine to refill presynaptic vesicles (de Juan-Sanz et al., 2013). Moore and Trussell used a GlyT2-Cre mouse line to express Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in glycinergic neurons in a floxed/reversed (Cre-dependent) manner, either globally or specifically within the VNLL. Using these two approaches, &lt;strong&gt;they photostimulated ascending glycinergic fibers and recorded light-evoked IPSCs from single neurons in the ICC using electrophysiology&lt;/strong&gt;. These experiments easily identified inhibitory currents, which were further dissected using pharmacology against glycine or GABA receptors to understand whether GABA is coreleased with glycine, as suggested by histological data. &lt;strong&gt;These experiments unequivocally demonstrated that GABA is coreleased with glycine in VNLL inputs&lt;/strong&gt; and revealed an average GABAergic component of ~40% of the light-evoked ICC currents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why GABA/glycine corelease? Do they have different functions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics allowed the authors to explore the characteristics of glycinergic and GABAergic components separately to probe for possible functional differences in the signaling of these coreleased neurotransmitters. These experiments are particularly interesting for the field, as there is currently limited understanding of the physiological roles of corelease in the same synapse, especially in the auditory midbrain. In the CNS GABA is coreleased with a variety of other neurotransmitters (Tritsch et al., 2016), but &lt;strong&gt;GABA/glycine corelease is one of the most paradoxical examples as both are fast inhibitory neurotransmitters&lt;/strong&gt;. Many functions of GABA/glycine corelease have been proposed, including subserving tonic versus phasic inhibition via different time courses of glycinergic and GABAergic synaptic currents, extra-fast inhibition, and compensation by one neurotransmitter during periods of sustained activity. To better understand the unique functions of each neurotransmitter in the VNLL-ICC synapse, the authors explored the responses in the ICC to glycine or GABA released from VNLL neurons, specifically measuring differences in kinetics, contacts with cell types in the ICC, short-term depression dynamics and effects of GABA on presynaptic glycine release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinetics of glycine and GABA are typically different, as it is known that GABAergic currents normally decay more slowly than glycinergic currents (Russier et al., 2002). Thus, glycine and GABA could serve different functions through differing postsynaptic kinetics. Surprisingly, the authors found that in the ICC, GABAergic currents were nearly as fast as glycinergic currents (3.7 vs 3.0 ms respectively), indicating that in this synapse slow depolarizing GABAergic IPSCs do not occur as observed in other situations. Cellular subtypes in the ICC express mainly the α1-GABA receptor subunit that endows GABA receptors with fast kinetics, which likely accounts for the observed phenotype. The authors then explored whether GABA and glycine present unique roles in short-term synaptic depression, as this high frequency stimulation could result in the selective depletion of one transmitter over the other. Similarly, no difference was found, as the relative contribution of glycine and GABA to the postsynaptic current was not dependent on the length and frequency of stimulation. Taken together, these results demonstrated that &lt;strong&gt;coreleased glycinergic and GABAergic currents in the ICC had strikingly similar features&lt;/strong&gt;, not supporting popular hypotheses for the different functions of GABA and glycine during corelease and suggesting that the two neurotransmitters may function interchangeably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the relevance of these discoveries?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results are particularly relevant to our molecular understanding of startle disease and how the medical community is treating this dysfunction. It is known that the startle response is finely tuned by inhibitory inputs from the VNLL, classically considered glycinergic. However, results from Moore and Trussell clearly demonstrate that a GABAergic component contributes to VNLL inhibition in the ICC, and their detailed studies of glycine and GABA responses in this pathway suggest that the two neurotransmitters may be functionally interchangeable. This suggests &lt;strong&gt;symptoms of the exaggerated startle response in hyperekplexia might be reduced by compensating for the lack of glycinergic neurotransmission with increased GABAergic neurotransmission&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, currently the most effective treatment for startle disease is the administration of GABA receptor agonists, such as Clonazepam, which significantly reduces startle activity in hyperekplexia patients (Zhou et al., 2002). Moore and Trussell’s results offer new details that should help to understand the molecular basis of this pharmacological compensation, helping the medical community to better exploit this pathway for future benefit. In addition, this work reveals a &lt;strong&gt;new role for glycine/GABA corelease in the CNS, where the action of both neurotransmitters appears interchangeable&lt;/strong&gt;. Independent receptor modulation coupled with the highly similar features of coreleased GABA and glycine observed in the study by Moore and Trussell may further permit the neurotransmitters to compensate for one another under conditions where one system is compromised, maintaining homeostasis of inhibitory networks integrated in the ICC.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/iStock-692805684-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The psychological and economic burden of intellectual disability (ID) on families is huge, with 1.5-2% of all children having an IQ &amp;lt; 70 and 0.3-0.5% of children having moderate-severe ID with an IQ &amp;lt;50. A craniofacial anomaly is described in 30-50% of the known genetic causes of ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced genomic sequencing can now identify variations in the DNA code of all ≈1500 known developmental disorder genes in one test. In 30-50% of cases, a diagnosis will be made by showing that a DNA variant has affected the function of a known gene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there are a large number of genes of unknown function. When variants are detected in these genes or in non-coding DNA, it can be difficult to determine if they are normal variations or the cause of the syndrome. Therefore, the question remains how best to proceed when a child with syndromic intellectual disability remains undiagnosed despite testing all the known developmental disorder genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing the DNA variants of individuals with similar features can lead to the discovery of new ID genes. However, locating at minimum a second individual or a cluster of individuals with similar facial features currently relies on doctors comparing photographs of undiagnosed children at medical meetings or recording written descriptions into international phenotyping and genetic variant databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One novel approach to this issue is the use of computer face-matching technology. In a paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12896-017-0410-1&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Biotechnology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Dudding et al. report an automated approach to matching the faces of non-identical individuals with one of ten genetic syndrome subgroups within a database of 3,145 images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer face-matching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core computer face-matching technology (FMT) used in this study was initially developed to match facial images of individuals for the primary purpose of recognizing blurry faces in CCTV for policing and counterterrorism. The software is being used to detect persons of interest in large crowd gatherings through various police and other security agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the software was developed for CCTV, high quality professional photographs are not required and even poor quality historical photographs can readily be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the software was developed for CCTV, high quality professional photographs are not required and even poor quality historical photographs can readily be used. This technology is unique as it uses low-resolution structural and frequency domain features rather than high resolution features. It is based on spatial textures and statistical models and is simultaneously insensitive to pose, illumination, expression, obscuration, blurring, decoding artifacts, and low-resolution images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the leave- one-out method (removing an individual image from the database and letting the software list the top 10 closest matches when the removed image is used as the test case), the computer face matching technology correctly identifies a top match, at least one correct match in the top five and at least one in the top 10 more than expected by chance. The accuracy of the software scored favorably compared with three senior clinical geneticists. There was low agreement between the technology and clinicians, with higher accuracy of the technology when results were discordant for all syndromes except Kabuki syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the accuracy of the computer face-matching technology was tested on images of individuals with known syndromic forms of intellectual disability, the results of this study illustrate the potential utility of face-matching technology within deep phenotyping platforms to facilitate the interpretation of DNA sequencing data for individuals who remain undiagnosed despite testing the known developmental disorder genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmacological therapy is only available for the minority of individuals with intellectual disability due to rare metabolic diseases; however, a definitive molecular diagnosis can inform prognosis, guide management, reduce the need for extensive investigations and restore reproductive confidence for parents planning further children. Understanding the genetic basis of ID is the first step towards understanding interacting biological pathways and possible targeted genetic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you see stress as helpful or harmful? If you recognise that it can have upsides – by sharpening your focus and boosting your motivation, and that stressful challenges can offer learning and achievement opportunities – then you have a positive stress mindset (conversely, if you see stress as unpleasant, debilitating and threatening, then you have a negative stress mindset).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1359432X.2017.1374947&quot;&gt;A new diary study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology&lt;/em&gt; has explored the implications of stress mindset for the workplace – surprisingly, one of the first investigations to do so. The researchers, led by Anne Casper at the University of Mannheim, found that anticipating a large workload on a given day was associated with employees upping their performance that day, taking more proactive steps to meet the challenge, and ending the day feeling more energised, but only if they had a positive stress mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32987&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings come from 171 employees in various occupations and industries, mainly education, health and social care, and IT. Their average age was 39 and just over half were men. They first completed a survey about their stress mindset. Then they completed an online diary three times a day – morning, after work, before bed – for five working days. In the morning, the diary prompted them to answer questions about the their expected workload that day. Later, it asked them about any constructive steps they’d taken to meet the day’s challenges, such as planning and scheduling, and seeing the challenge as a learning opportunity. In the evening, participants also indicated how well they’d performed, and how energetic they felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For employees with a positive stress mindset, there was an association between expecting a larger workload and taking more proactive steps to cope. In turn, these proactive, constructive behaviours (the researchers call this “approach coping”) were related to performing better, and feeling more energised. But for those with a negative stress mindset, this association was reversed – the more workload they anticipated, the less they performed constructive coping behaviours. In turn, the worse these workers said they’d performed, and the less energised they felt at the day’s end. This is consistent with the idea that people with a negative stress mindset try to cope through avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings complement previous research that’s shown our stress mindset can influence how we respond to challenges. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23437923&quot;&gt;students with a positive stress mindset are more inclined to seek out feedback&lt;/a&gt; after completing a stressful task (presumably because they see it as a chance to learn).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casper and her colleagues said their new results show the benefits that could come from raising people’s awareness of the concept of stress mindset. Promisingly, they said there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23437923&quot;&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; that people can be helped to develop a positive stress mindset. However, they also acknowledged some limitations with their research – for instance, they didn’t look at employees’ expectations about how difficult their work will be (only how much they had to do). Similarly, the measure of stress mindset lacked nuance. Some people may think modest amounts of stress are helpful, for example, but that extreme stress is harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d add another caveat – this study doesn’t provide strong causal evidence for the effects of stress mindset. That would require altering some employees’ stress mindset through a training programme and looking to see what effects this had on their behaviour and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it’s worth noting, as the researchers do, that this study focused on effects within a single day. It’s well-established that a &lt;em&gt;chronic&lt;/em&gt; excessive workload is associated with negative outcomes for health and performance (most likely regardless of mindset). This study shows that having a positive stress mindset may help us cope with – perhaps even benefit from – a particularly challenging, high intensity work day, but this shouldn’t be taken as a justification for bosses to overburden their staff long-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1359432X.2017.1374947&quot;&gt;Mindset matters: the role of employees’ stress mindset for day-specific reactions to workload anticipation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video games do not enjoy the best of reputations. Violent games in particular have been linked with aggression, antisocial behaviour and alienation among teens. For example, one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19207695&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that playing a mere 10 minutes of a violent video game was enough to reduce helping behaviour in participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, some experts are sceptical about whether games really cause aggression and, even if the games are to blame, it remains unclear what drives their harmful effects. Earlier studies identified empathy as a key trait that may be affected by violent gameplay. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/12/12/1869/4344826&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Laura Stockdale at Loyola University Chicago and her colleagues in &lt;i&gt;Social Affective and Cognitive Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt; has taken a closer look at how gamers and non-gamers differ at a neural level, uncovering evidence that suggests chronic violent gameplay may affect emotional brain processing, although more research is needed to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32980&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were classified as frequent or infrequent players of video games depending on weekly usage – at least 30 hours of screen time per week was considered frequent, while no more than five hours a week was considered infrequent. Next, the scientists looked at the top three games their participants played, more specifically if the majority were either violent (for example, a shooter video game such as &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;) or non-violent (for example &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt;). This yielded a sample of 30 frequent players of violent video games (gamers) and 31 infrequent players of non-violent games (controls). Both groups had an average age of 21 and all were male.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants first completed an established empathy questionnaire, with the gamers scoring lower than the controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the actual experiment, the researchers recorded participants’ brain waves using electroencephalography (EEG) while they completed a modified version of the “stop-signal task” (SST). The SST contained male and female faces with fearful or happy expressions and there were two types of trial: On Go trials, participants had to indicate as fast as possible whether the face was male or female by pressing a button. On No-go (stop) trials – indicated by a box around the face – participants had to withhold making any response. This version of the SST is generally considered an implicit measure of emotion processing because participants have to pay attention to the gender of the faces while trying to ignore the emotions on the faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gamers and controls performed similarly on this task. Crucially, however, the brain activity of the two groups differed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers were particularly interested in three components of the EEG recordings during the stop-signal task, the so-called P100, N170 and N200/P300 (these positive or negative spikes of neural activity, known as “event-related potentials”, occur at different times after the stimuli). The P100 (a positive spike 100ms after the stimulus) is one of the earliest indices of processing of visual information and has been associated with attention to emotional information. The N170 is evoked by viewing a human face, especially if it displays a negative emotion (such as fear). Finally, the N200/P300 is generally believed to be associated with inhibiting responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Go trials, gamers showed a reduced P100 in response specifically to happy faces, as compared to the controls. This suggests the gamers may have been paying less attention to positive facial stimuli. Interestingly, however, this was explained by differences in empathy rather than screen time or game content. When examining only the gamers who scored high on the empathy questionnaire, they did not differ neurally from the controls. This indicates that empathy manifests in the earliest stages of how we process emotional information, and this could be one way that violent video games affect our perception. In line with this, the gamers showed an earlier N170 to happy than to fearful faces, which is the opposite of what normally happens (and the opposite of the pattern shown by the controls). This may indicate that gamers gave reduced neural priority to threatening faces, compared with normal, perhaps due to their overexposure to threatening content in games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, gamers seemed to require a lower amount of neural resources to inhibit their responses (as shown by a reduced N200/P300). It could be that video games train cognitive function and this is why gamers need fewer mental resources for this task. Alternatively, and in line with the finding of a reduced P100 amplitude, it could be that gamers simply pay less attention to emotional information, are less distracted by it and thus needed fewer mental resources for the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the researchers said their results are consistent with the idea that the chronic playing of violent video games affects people’s empathy and the way their brains process emotional facial expressions and control their behavioural responses. In short, chronic violent gameplay may leave players “callous, cool and in control”, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While interesting, this study is not free of limitations. Clearly, the biggest drawback lies with the cross-sectional design, which cannot clarify whether violent video gameplay causes lower empathy and reduced emotional processing or the other way around. Also, it is not easy to disentangle the effects of video gaming content (i.e., whether it is violent or not) and gaming duration because there was no group of frequent players of non-violent video games or infrequent players of violent video games. Plausibly, the duration gamers spend each week on their consoles could be more important than what the video game is about. For obvious reasons, any association between video gaming and empathy found here only applies to a Western context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So more research is clearly needed. But if chronic exposure to violent video games really is associated with lower empathy and emotional callousness, this could have major implications for policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/12/12/1869/4344826&quot;&gt;Cool, callous and in control: superior inhibitory control in frequent players of video games with violent content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 Nerd Food: The Refactoring Quagmire&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_07.org&quot;&gt;The latest Dogen sprint&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be a really long and tortuous one, which is all the more perplexing given the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_06.org&quot;&gt;long&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_05.org&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_04.org&quot;&gt;hard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_03.org&quot;&gt;sprints&lt;/a&gt; that preceded it. Clearly, the slope of the curve is steepening unrelentingly. Experience teaches that whenever you find yourself wandering over such terrains, it is time to stop and gather your thoughts; more likely than not, you are going the wrong way - fast. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, for Dogen, this a post of reflection. To the casual reader - if nothing else - it will hopefully serve as a cautionary tale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-1&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Not Even Wrong&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are one of the lucky few internauts who avidly follows our release notes, you may recall that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.06&quot;&gt;previous sprint&lt;/a&gt; had produced a moment of enlightenment where we finally understood &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt;core of Dogen. At the time, it felt like one of those rare &lt;i&gt;eureka&lt;/i&gt;moments, and &quot;the one last great change to the architecture&quot;; afterwards, all would be light. &quot;Famous last words&quot;, you may have said then and, of course, if you did, you were right. But given the historical context, the optimism wasn't entirely unjustified. To understand why, we need to quickly recap how the architecture has evolved over time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dogen started out divided into three very distinct parts: the frontends (Dia, JSON), the middle-end (&lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt;) and the backends (C++, C#). The &quot;pipeline&quot; metaphor guided our design because we saw Dogen very much like a compiler, with its frontend, middle-end and backend stages. This was very handy as it meant we could test all stages of the pipeline in isolation. Composition was done by orchestrating frontend, middle-end and backends, at a higher level. This architecture had very good properties when it came to testability and debuggability: we'd start by running the entire pipeline and locating the problem; then, one could easily isolate the issue to a specific component either by looking at the log file, or by dumping the inputs and outputs of the different stages and sifting through them. As a result, bug reproduction was very straightforward since we just needed to record the inputs and create the test at the right level. Whilst the names of the models and their responsibilities changed over time, the overall pipeline architecture remained so since the very early days of Dogen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In parallel to this, a second trend had emerged over the last ten sprints or so: we moved more and more functionality from the frontends and backends to the middle-end. The key objective here was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%2527t_repeat_yourself&quot;&gt;DRY&lt;/a&gt;: we soon found a lot of commonalities between frontends, driving us to create a simple frontend intermediate format so that the work was carried out only once. Not long after, we discovered that backends suffered from precisely the same malaise, so the same cure begun to be applied there too. So far so good, as we were following &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dmi.usherb.ca/~sgiroux/COURS/2008/ift785/fichiers/articles/Roberts_EvolvingFrameworks.pdf&quot;&gt;Roberts and Johnson's&lt;/a&gt; sage advice: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People develop abstractions by generalizing from concrete examples. Every attempt to determine the correct abstractions on paper without actually developing a running system is doomed to failure. No one is that smart. A framework is a reusable design, so you develop it by looking at the things it is supposed to be a design of. The more examples you look at, the more general your framework will be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The literature was with us and the wind was on our sails: the concrete code in the frontends and backends was slowly cleaned up, made general and moved across to the middle-end. As this process took hold, the middle-end grew and grew in size and responsibilities, just as everybody else shed them. Before long, we ended up with one big model, a couple medium-sized models and lots of very small models: &quot;modelets&quot;, we named them. These were models with very little responsibility other than gluing together one or two things. The overhead of maintaining a physical component (e.g. static or dynamic library) for the sake of one or two classes seemed a tad too high. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As we begun to extrapolate the trend somewhat, a vision suddenly appeared: why not centralise &lt;b&gt;everything&lt;/b&gt; in the middle-end? That is: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;place &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; meta-models and transforms in one single central location, together with their orchestration; call it the &quot;core model&quot;; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;orchestration becomes either helper code or a transform in its own right; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;within this &quot;core model&quot;, provide interfaces that backends and frontends implement, injecting them dynamically; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;make these new interfaces appear as transform chains themselves (mostly). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this elegant and clean brave new world, we would no longer have &quot;ends&quot; as such but something more akin to &quot;plugins&quot;, dynamically glued into the &quot;middle-end&quot; via the magic of dependency injection; the &quot;middle-end&quot; itself would no longer be a &quot;middle&quot; but &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; center of everything. Backends and frontends had to merely implement the interfaces supplied by the core and the system would just magically sort itself out. The idea seemed amazing and we quickly moved to implementation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alas, in our haste to jump into the fray, we had forgotten to heed Mencken: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[T]here is always a well-known solution to every human problem — neat, plausible, and wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-2&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;The Strange Loop&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest downsides of working alone and in your spare time is the lack of feedback from other developers. And it's not even just that other developers will teach you lots of new things. No, most often than not, they'll simply drag you away from the echo chambers and tunnels of self-reinforcement you carefully craft and curate for yourself. You are your own intellectual jailer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the cold light of day, any developer will tell you that creating cycles is not a good idea, and should not be done without a great deal of thought. Yet, we managed to create &quot;circular&quot; dependencies between all components of the system by centralising all responsibilities into &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt;. Now, you may say that these are not &quot;canonically circular&quot; - and this is probably why the problem was not picked up in the first place - because &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; provides interfaces for other models to implement. Well, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Large-Scale-C-Software-Design-APC/dp/0201633620&quot;&gt;Lakos&lt;/a&gt; is very helpful here in explaining what is going on: our &lt;i&gt;logical design&lt;/i&gt; had no cycles - because &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; does not explicitly call any frontends or backends - but the &lt;i&gt;physical design&lt;/i&gt;did have them. And these came at a cost. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For starters, it screwed up &lt;a href=&quot;https://the-whiteboard.github.io/coding/debugging/2016/04/07/reasonable-code.html&quot;&gt;reasonability&lt;/a&gt;. Even though frontends and backends still had their own models, the net result was that we jumbled up all of the elements of the pipeline into a single model, making it really hard to tell what's what. Explaining the system to a new developer now required saying things such as &quot;ah, don't worry about that part for now, it belongs to the middle-end, but here we are dealing only with the backends&quot; - a clear code smell. Once a property of the architecture, reasonability now had to be conveyed in lossy natural language. Testability and debuggability got screwed up too because now everything went through one single central model; if you needed to test a frontend fix you still required building the backends and middle-end and initialise them too. Our pursuit of clarity muddied up the waters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, an even more pertinent question arose: just when exactly should you stop refactoring? In my two decades of professional development, I had never encountered this problem. In the real world, you are fortunate if you get a tiny amount of time allocated to refactoring - most of the time you need to somehow sneak it in into some overall estimate and hope no one notices. Like sharks, Project Managers (PM) are bred to smell refactoring efforts from a mile a way and know how to trim estimates down to the bone. Even when you are in a greenfield project or just lucky enough to have an enlightened PM who will bat for you, you still need to contend with the realities of corporate development: you need to ship, &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;. No one gets away with endless refactoring. No one, that is, other than the Free and Open Source Software Developer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like many a spare time project, Dogen is my test bed of ideas around coding and coding processes; a general sandbox to have fun outside of work. As such - and very much by design - the traditional feedback loops that exist in the real world need not apply. I wanted to see what would happen if you coded without &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; constraints and, in the end, what I found out was that if you do not self-impose some kind of halting machinery, &lt;i&gt;you will refactor on forever&lt;/i&gt;. In practice, physics still apply, so your project will eventually die out because its energy will dissipate across the many refactoring fronts and entropy will, as always, triumph. But if you really want to keep it at bay, at least for a little while, you need to preserve energy by having one single, consistent vision - &quot;wrong&quot; as it may be according to some metric or other. For, as Voltaire said and we often forget, &quot;le mieux est l'ennemi du bien&quot;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trouble is that refactoring is made up of a set of engineering trade-offs, and when you optimise for one thing you'll inevitably make something else worse. So, first and foremost, you need to make sure you understand what your trade-offs are, and prioritise accordingly. Secondly, looking for a global minima in such a gigantic multidimensional space is impossible, so you need to make do with local minima. But how do you known you reach a &quot;good enough&quot; point in that space? You need some kind of conceptual cost function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-3&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Descending the Gradient&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it was that we started by defining the key dimensions across which we were trying to optimise. This can be phrased slightly differently: given what we now know about the domain and its implementation, what are the most important characteristics of an idealised physical and logical design? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After some thinking, the final answer was deceptively simple: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;the entities of the logical design (models, namespaces, classes, methods and the like) should reflect what one reads in the literature of Model Driven Engineering (MDE). That is, a person competent on the field should find a code base that talks his or her language. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;logical and physical design should promote reasonability and isolation, and thus orchestration should be performed via composition rather than by circular physical dependencies. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, these are the two fundamental pillars guiding the Dogen architecture; any engineering trade-offs to be made must ensure these dimensions take precedence. In other words, we can only optimise away any &quot;modelets&quot; if they do not impact negatively either of these two dimensions. If they do, then we must discard this refactoring option. More generally, it is now possible to &quot;cost&quot; all refactoring activity - a conceptual refactoring gradient descent if you'd like; it either brings us closer to the local minima or further away. It gave us a sieve with which to filter the product and sprint backlogs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To cut a rather long story short, we ended up with a &quot;final&quot; - ha, ha - set of changes to the architecture to get us closer to the local minima: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;move away from sewing terms&lt;/b&gt;: from the beginning we had used terms such as &lt;code&gt;knitter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; and so forth. These were… colourful, but did not add any value and detracted us from the first dimension. This was a painful decision but clearly required if one is to comply to point one above: we need to replace all sewing terms with domain specific vocabulary. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;reorganise the models into a pipeline&lt;/b&gt;: however, instead of simply going back to the &quot;modelets&quot; of the past, we need to have a deep think as to what responsibilities belong at what stage of the pipeline. Perhaps the &quot;modelets&quot; were warning us of design failures. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;outline-2&quot; id=&quot;outline-container-sec-4&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-4&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its never a great feeling when you end a long and arduous sprint only to figure out you were going in the wrong direction in design space. In fact, it is rather frustrating. We have many stories in the product backlog which are really exciting and which will add real value to the end users - well, at this point, just us really but hey - yet we seemed to be lost in some kind of refactoring ground hog day, with no end in sight. However, the main point of Dogen is to teach, and learn we undoubtedly did. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As with anything in the physical world, nothing in software engineering exists in splendid perfection like some kind of platonic solid. Perfection belongs to the realm of maths. In engineering, something can only be described as &quot;fit for purpose&quot;, and to do so requires to first determine best we can what that purpose might be. So, before you wonder into a refactoring quagmire of your own making, be sure to have a very firm idea of what your trade-offs are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;status&quot; id=&quot;postamble&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;Created: 2018-01-03 Wed 15:55&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;creator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&quot;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; 25.2.2 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org&quot;&gt;Org&lt;/a&gt; mode 8.2.10)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;validation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer&quot;&gt;Validate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

But is there any substance to this idea, or have we been misled – by biographers drawn to artists with colourful and chaotic lives, and the conceits of cultural movements like the romantics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific attempts to resolve this question, which have mainly focused on disorders of mood, have so far struggled to reach a definitive answer. However, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691617699653&quot;&gt;a new review&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Perspectives on Psychological Science&lt;/i&gt;, Christa Taylor of Albany State University has applied surgical precision to open up the existing body of research and lay out what we currently know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32973&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor identified 36 studies on the creativity-mood disorder relationship from a set of almost 3000 that were potentially relevant. She combined data from these different studies into into separate “meta-analyses”, depending on the specific question she was trying to address. We can be confident in the findings from these meta-analyses because they involved data from thousands or even millions of participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor first looked at whether creative people are more likely to have a mood disorder compared to non-creative controls. She looked at data from from ten studies involving fine arts students, creative writers, and eminent figures from creative fields, and found that yes, there was a clear relationship between being creative and having a diagnosis of a mood disorder, such as depression (overall the association had a moderate-to-large effect size). This finding held across different ways of measuring creativity, such as musical performance or tests of divergent thinking (finding new ideas or solutions). Creativity was most commonly associated with bipolar disorder (a condition marked by periods of low and high mood). It was not associated with all mood disorders – for instance, dysthymic disorder (frequent short episodes of low mood) was no more common among creative people than controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address a slightly different question –  compared to healthy controls, are people with a clinical diagnosis of mood disorder more creative? – Taylor used a second meta-analysis combining 13 studies, including a set of mega-studies involving millions of people. The answer was a quavering &lt;i&gt;no, not really&lt;/i&gt;. Overall, differences in creativity between people with mood disorder and control were statistically non-significant. Taylor only detected any meaningful differences by narrowing the definition of creativity – people with mood disorders scored higher for painting ability, for instance, but not for many other measures, such as on laboratory tests of creativity, for example. Focusing on specific disorders, Taylor found some evidence for superior creativity among those with bipolar disorder and major depression (but still the differences from controls were modest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings appear contradictory, but to simplify, they suggest that creative people are indeed liable to mood disorder, but overall there is little evidence that a mood disorder makes you more creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some reasons why this might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps mood disorder is a boon to creativity, but this benefit is typically buried under a host of disadvantages and so doesn’t show up in most studies. (Compare with the clutch of successful people who attribute their success to struggles in early life; their existence doesn’t mean that we should expect disadvantage to reliably yield success.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If low mood does have a (often hidden) beneficial effect on creativity, one possibility is that it can initiate reflections that lead to new ways of seeing the world. This could explain why the deep dives of depression were associated with higher creativity but the evanescent changes of dysthemia were not. Moreover, by combining lows with motivation-charged highs, perhaps bipolar disorder combines the deep dives with a return to the surface, giving a chance for these insights to manifest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative explanation for the new findings is that mood disorder doesn’t help creativity at all, but creativity creates mood disorder as a by-product. The lifestyle required in many creative fields can be punishing – I’m thinking of the musicians and stand-ups who spend most nights in Holiday Inns or on unfamiliar sofas; the financial instability and tournament-like nature of many artistic fields; the profligate substance misuse. The first meta-analysis showed that as mood disorder symptoms topped out, creativity actually dropped off, which could fit with this picture (but could also fit the boon-plus-disadvantage model, if the boon was only activated by mild symptoms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally,  it could be that being creative just makes you appear clinically abnormal. Taylor points out this could happen in an affected manner, to “play creative”, but could also be because many aspects of the “flow state” – extended bursts of activity, disregarding the need for sleep or food, absorption or attentional wandering, rapidly flowing thoughts – are also treated as markers of bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research doesn’t fully resolve the long-running questions about whether and how mood disorders and creativity are linked, but it does pour water on some perspectives, such as expecting those struggling with a disorder to thrive creatively. Where the results are most unambiguous is in the higher incidence of disorder in creative people, which yields clear questions for future research, such as whether this is related to how strongly a culture makes assumptions about the temperament of “real artists”. And for you and me, it’s an important reminder that headlines like “creative people tend to get blue” does not imply that “being blue, you tend to get creative”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691617699653&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creativity and Mood Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 In a new paper in the Journal of Experimental &amp;amp; Theoretical Artificial Intelligence, Chris Drummond takes aim at the 'reproducibility movement' which has lately risen to prominence in science.



As one of the early advocates for this movement, I was interested to see what Drummond had to say. While I don't find his argument wholly convincing, he does raise some good points.

Drummond begins by summarizing the case for reproducible research as it sees it. The claim is that reproducibil</content>

To mark this &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2010/11/celebration-of-failure.html&quot;&gt;Celebration of Failure&lt;/a&gt;, I have compiled a Bottom Five list,&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the year's least popular posts as measured by Google Analytics.

Then the total pageviews for each post was prorated by the vintage of the post, to give an estimate of daily views.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results: &lt;/b&gt;The posts are listed in inverse order, starting with #5 and ending with #1 (least popular).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;5 Most Unpopular Posts of 2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;5.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/06/terrorism-and-implicit-association-test.html&quot;&gt;Terrorism and the Implicit Association Test&lt;/a&gt; – I actually worked pretty hard on this one. It's about the stereotyping of Muslims, the importance of language (e.g., Theresa May: “&lt;i&gt;the single, evil ideology of Islamist extremism that  preaches hatred, sows division, and promotes sectarianism&lt;/i&gt;”), a demonstration that &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/183&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/Study?tid=-1&quot;&gt;Arab-Muslim IAT&lt;/a&gt; (which found little to no bias against Muslims), and some general &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chronicle.com/article/Can-We-Really-Measure-Implicit/238807&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; with the IAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/08/smell-as-weapon-and-odor-as.html&quot;&gt;Smell as a Weapon, and Odor as Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; – This was from my two-part olfactory series, which covered the interesting history of  &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books/about/Olfaction_Warfare.html?id=Bmy4oQEACAAJ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Olfactory Warfare&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (e.g, stink bombs, stealth camouflage) and the use of smell in cinematic and VR contexts. {&lt;i&gt;or at least, it was interesting to me&lt;/i&gt;}.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-big-bad-brain.html&quot;&gt;The Big Bad Brain&lt;/a&gt; – This featured a fun and catchy music video (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIOaU7Sm-ZE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;High&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) by &lt;a href=&quot;http://sir-sly.com/&quot;&gt;Sir Sly&lt;/a&gt;, which was an earworm for me. But too esoteric and not much staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/03/whats-popular-at-cns2017.html&quot;&gt;What's Popular at #CNS2017?&lt;/a&gt; – This falls under the perennially unpopular category of “yearly conference announcements”, which is only relevant around the time of the meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/08/olfactory-deterrence.html&quot;&gt;Olfactory Deterrence&lt;/a&gt; – This was about the prospect of nuclear war and how putrid smells might deter the use of nuclear weapons, along with eradicating cavalier attitudes about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion: &lt;/b&gt;We can easily see some themes emerging: the IAT, olfaction, music videos, and the Cognitive Neuroscience Society  meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; People are sick of the IAT, aren't thrilled about the sense of smell (especially in relation to nuclear war), and do not like music videos or CNS Meeting announcements. However, they do like meeting recaps, as shown by the popularity of&lt;span class=&quot;PostTitle&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/04/what-are-big-ideas-in-cognitive.html&quot;&gt; What are the Big Ideas in Cognitive Neuroscience?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;PostTitle&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/04/the-big-ideas-in-cognitive-neuroscience.html&quot;&gt;The Big Ideas in Cognitive Neuroscience, Explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/29/16820474/2017-tech-recap-uber-scandal-waymo-lawsuits-travis-kalanick&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The Verge 2017 tech report card: Uber&quot;&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; deserves special mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This one is from 2016, but it's a real eye-opener: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolineodonovan/the-not-so-wholesome-reality-behind-the-making-of-your-meal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Not-So-Wholesome Reality Behind The Making of Your Meal Kit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This has been the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarcastic_f/status/917722190463754240&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The unbearable anxiety and grief of losing a close friend to cancer. And then your spouse receives a stage 4 diagnosis a month later&quot;&gt;worst-ever year&lt;/a&gt; for me personally as well, so I see no reason to be optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Actually, #5 is &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/09/survival-and-grief.html&quot;&gt;Survival and Grief&lt;/a&gt;. I cannot bear to feature this one, so the closely ranked #6 is a stand-in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The post with the absolute lowest number of views (&lt;span class=&quot;PostTitle&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/12/brief-guide-to-cte-brains-in-news-part_11.html&quot;&gt;Brief Guide to the CTE Brains in the News.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Amidst the rising tensions in the world around us, people are finding themselves in the unique position of having to make hard decisions about choosing passive observation or active participation, causing some to toss their opinions into the fray of the multitude of voices speaking out within society today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to what we have been accustomed to living and being for several decades, the pendulum of Change has begun its swing towards the opposite direction. The social tension created from this shift in direction has many of us unsettled. Enough so that many of us have turned inward in order to make sense of our external reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to seek balance and stability is inherent within us as human beings. We are meant to understand the other person’s point of view and seek the middle ground in between our two views in order to create perspective. Out of that informed perspective, we make decisions on how to act, our behavior evolves from those decisions, and consequently, our lives come into being from those personal thoughts and actions. This is how human beings are naturally designed to grow, evolve, and become within a constantly ever-changing world. If we are in the &lt;em&gt;right place&lt;/em&gt; (along the spectrum of choices), &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;the right time&lt;/em&gt; (to make a decision), &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;right action&lt;/em&gt; (behavior and action) &lt;em&gt;is effortless&lt;/em&gt; as we pivot our way into a greater life. This is one of the key tenets of my book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mydiamondquest.net/&quot;&gt;How &lt;/a&gt;Me Found I: Mastering the Art of Pivoting Gracefully Through Life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compassionate Neutrality vs. “My Way or the Highway”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “Dual” means two or something composed of two parts – harmony and balance is achieved in the coming together. The word “Duality” is when the two parts are in opposition to each other – competitive adversaries moving away from each other towards extreme polarization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that context, we are naturally hardwired to seek balance, “true inner balance”. Yet our external world is filled with ego-driven polarization ? “duality” ? the corrupted version of what “dual” really means. Because we are naturally designed to always seek balance (whether we are aware of it or not) and because the only constant we can expect in life is “Change”, then balance in an environment of dynamic change is achieved through a “two-party system”, a dual-system structure of compensating complimentary counterparts. As humans, psychologically our dual-system structure is the Ego-Heart handshake. This uniquely human complimentary relationship is inherent within what I call a “Natural Person”. To strive for continual balance is our natural state of mind in dealing with changing realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, our society, in its current presence of mind, does not recognize that the ego and the heart has a dual-system relationship, meant to counter balance each other so that we humans can continue to evolve within an ever-changing dynamic environment. For many of us, as we age and grow, the individual personalities that we exhibit outwardly are the reflections of our egos maturing as we learn how to adhere to the conditional social norms set forth for us to survive and operate within society. In contrast to the “natural person”, this ego-developed persona is what I call our “Conditioned Personality”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the word “dual” has become synonymous with the word “duality”, “It’s my way or the highway,” or “I’m right, you’re wrong”. Absent of the true meaning of a two-party system of balance, we have disintegrated into a mindset of where everything is now seen from the corrupted filters of polarized duality. Collaborative and communal dialogue has given way to personalized monologues based on absolute judgment and opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This need to convince people that one way, and only one way, “my way”, is the cause for the rising tensions in the world today, as evidenced in the political, socio-economic, and ethno-diverse arenas of discussion. Unaware that balance is inherently a desire that we are hardwired for and ignorant that it is a partner to the heart, the ego interprets that innate desire as a need to convince others that its viewpoint is the right way to go and disregards, seeks to dominate, even eliminate the natural role the heart is meant to play. For the ego, all roads must lead to Rome and it is all about me, only me. There can be no other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have individual egos; each convinced that its way is the correct way to go. Our own heartfelt knowing and the innate need for natural equilibrium have been mutated into a need to strive for a dominant view, absent of room for another view to exist. We have left the middle field in the center to take up position at either end of the playing field. As it meets resistance from other egos, our ego’s need for superiority can only lead to an outcome of aggressive force, more domination, and ultimately violence. We will kill to be right. We must be right at all costs. The end justifies the means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, the heart does exist and is very much a part of our physical and psychological makeup. It cannot be ignored, subjugated, or disregarded. Without the heart, we physically cease to exist. Without the heart, we have no conscience. It is through the heart that we connect to the greater wholeness of life in accordance to God, Nature, and the Universe, whichever you choose to refer to the larger part of who we are. The heart inherently knows that balance is necessary for our very own existence as a species. It defines our humanness, guides our humanitarian endeavors, and nourishes our humanity. It knows that it is the counterpart to the ego in a dual-system structure designed to move towards compassionate neutrality, thus bringing well-being into our lives. It is what allows us to respond to the environment in a nonjudgmental and loving way. It doesn’t need to be justified; it just needs us to be aware so that it can guide the ego towards creating a better life. Together, this heart-ego handshake is what allows us to make sense of what is happening in our extrinsic environment and make the right intrinsic decisions that can mutually benefit ourselves and others, not only ourselves. It is this communal awareness that we are both individually a person, and yet connected to each other as part of an overall human community, that gives us comfort that we are truly ever alone, unprotected, isolated, or abandoned. This awareness is the umbilical existence of our personality within the nesting doll collective of the human species. If we take care and look out for the welfare of others, then in turn we also receive benefit for our own self. Vice versa, if we look for balance within, then our external society also receives the benefit of that internal balance because we will emanate that behavior out into our external world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for us to de-escalate the rising tension and violence in the external world of our society today, we, as members of humanity, need to look within and seek balance the way a natural person would. We need to reestablish the dual-system structure of the ego-heart handshake through intention, voice, and action. Because we are human and inherently designed for balance, we will naturally always seek to return to a state of compassionate neutrality; regardless of how long it takes to do so and despite what our ego thinks. The pendulum will eventually swing from any extreme edge to the center fulcrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when we are at the extreme edge of a pendulum swing (the ego’s viewpoint), the pull from the other extreme edge (the heart’s viewpoint) will become intense enough to cause the pendulum to begin swinging back to the center where the heart’s communal compassion and a neutral ego’s informed judgment jointly resides. It is Mother Nature’s way of ensuring survival in a dynamically changing way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fallacy of our egos not understanding this natural fundamental principle of life will cause us to resist that innate impulse of allowing the other viewpoint to change our mind. Instead, we will literally fight to enforce our viewpoint to maintain our position. We don’t want the pendulum to swing at all. We want to remain in status quo, defiant to the extreme, and will react violently, determined to maintain our current position, against all natural forces of movement. This is the cause of the rising tensions in our world today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We All Have a Choice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative, may I suggest that it is compassionate neutrality that we all seek, an aligned response to the natural forces of constant change occurring within our environment. It is what Buddhism calls, “the middle way”. It is operating from the center fulcrum of the pendulum swing, the vesica piscis of creation, the ability to see both sides and optimally benefit from the combined viewpoints. It is living life from both the macro and micro views of both the mountain peak and the valley below. This is how we survive, evolve, and grow as humans being humans, citizens of humankind, and as members of the human species.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Ho-ho-ho! Look what Santa brought us here! This awesome neuroscience blog has awoken from the master thesis-induced hibernation and is ready to bring the wonder of neuroscientific discovery to the masses again! What a great present! (I know, you might have asked for a new laptop or a promotion. Talk it out with Santa, I’m doing what I can here).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this year (thankfully) nears its end I sampled some of the most interesting neuroscience studies of 2017 to make you go &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;whoa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Buckle up kiddos, this one is gonna be quite a ride!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Let’s get the really important stuff out of the way first: this year I &lt;s data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt; survived &lt;/s&gt; finished my master thesis and got a neuroscience degree! Without a doubt the most exciting piece of news far and wide.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.
The second most exciting piece of news (for all the psychedelics enthusiasts at least) is yet another study by London researchers which solidified the potential benefits of psilocybin (the active compound of magic mushrooms) for people with depression&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13282-7&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The scientists found that a single dose of psilocybin leads to an effect they described as a “reset” of the brain. All of the patients with treatment-resistant depression felt much better one week after the treatment and 47% reported feeling much less depressed even 5 weeks after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day after the trip scientists observed substantial changes in the functional connectivity of the brain -- that is, in the way brain regions talk to each other. For example, the regions shown to be communicating too much in depressed patients (fueling up rumination as they do) were much less talkative with each other after the trip. The extent of these changes also helped to predict whether a patient would still be less depressed 5 weeks after the experiment. Moreover, there was a decreased blood flow in amygdala, our fear center, which went along with reduced depressive symptoms. Can’t have depression if the fear center is starved!&lt;/p&gt;


  

  	
      
      
        
          
            
              &lt;img alt=&quot;C4fDBjhXUAA2Wqq.jpg&quot; class=&quot;thumb-image&quot; data-image=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/573b647d2fe131f40453f2f9/t/5a452afd53450ac1b252e8e1/1514482473619/C4fDBjhXUAA2Wqq.jpg&quot; data-image-dimensions=&quot;250x245&quot; data-image-focal-point=&quot;0.5,0.5&quot; data-image-id=&quot;5a452afd53450ac1b252e8e1&quot; data-load=&quot;false&quot; data-type=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/573b647d2fe131f40453f2f9/t/5a452afd53450ac1b252e8e1/1514482473619/C4fDBjhXUAA2Wqq.jpg?format=1000w&quot; /&gt;
            
          

          

        
      
      
    

  


&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the after-the-trip changes were very different from during-the-trip changes (read up &lt;a href=&quot;http://overthebrainbow.com/blog/2016/5/18/science-of-being-high-your-brain-on-acid&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://overthebrainbow.com/blog/2016/6/10/lsd-shrooms-mdma-or-how-i-went-to-a-psychedelic-research-conference-in-amsterdam&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you're interested in what's going on in your brain &lt;em&gt;during the trip&lt;/em&gt;). This led to the assumption that psilocybin first causes an acute disintegration during the trip (networks fall apart, “I just talked to the Universe, man!!” etc.) followed by a post-trip re-integration where the parts come back together but in a better, less dysfunctional way (like maybe the thought pattern “My boss did not answer because HE HATES ME!!” is substituted by something… more reasonable), hence the “reset” term. Of course, there is still a lot of room for improvement but it seems that step by step we are nearing a new promising treatment for even the most stubborn of depressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.
Maybe even more exciting is that researchers have created a non-invasive brain-computer-interface (BCI) that allows communication with completely locked-in patients who have zero muscular control&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002593#pbio.1002593.ref013&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If I was out for sensationalist headlines I would even say… there was some mind-reading involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there has been some progress allowing locked-in patients to communicate with the outside world&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17234696&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27590968&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, a meta study&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clinph-journal.com/article/S1388-2457(08)00911-5/fulltext&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; revealed that none of the options is optimal (for one, a good chunk of them is directed to people whose eye muscles were intact and are not appropriate for people who can’t move their eyes and blink). This is where the present study comes in.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By measuring changes in the electrical activity and blood oxygen level in the brains of 4 completely paralysed patients researchers were able to establish a binary “yes/no” communication with them. First, patients were repeatedly asked some basic questions and instructed to think “yes” or “no” as a response. An algorithm was then trained to differentiate between patterns of blood flow and electrical activity for both of these responses. Soon it was able to accurately recognise the patient’s thought answer in 70% of cases. Interestingly, all 4 patients thought a “yes” when asked whether they are happy. We should be happy too as this study is paving the way to establish -- at first a rudimentary -- communication with people who are harder to reach (as compared to patients who still can move the eyes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a demonstration of how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.
Throw out your anti-age face cream! Scientists have managed to slow down aging by tweaking the brain! Okay, it is really easy to get carried away with sensationalism… Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, researchers have discovered that stem cells (a type of cell that can develop itself into many different cell types) in hypothalamus (brain region concerned with many bodily functions) regulate ageing&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23282&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;The researchers noticed that these stem cells start to vanish from mice hypothalamus around 11 month of age (corresponding to around 40-50 in human years) and completely disappear by 22 months. Such signs of ageing like memory loss went along with the amount of the lost stem cells.                                                                 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists then proceeded to remove or add stem cells to this region in order to speed up or slow down the ageing. Turned out that mice in whom the majority of stem cells was removed displayed premature ageing, got retired, complained about youngsters all day long and died significantly earlier. However, when stem cells were added mice showed better memory performance, did power walking, played bingo and lived 200 days longer compared to an average mouse. It has to be noted that the implantation only worked if the new stem cells were made to be resistant to inflammation as the age-related inflammation seems to interfere with the hard-working stem cells preventing their anti-age effect.&lt;br /&gt;There is still a long way to go before you can really throw away your anti-aging cream... but we are sure on our way there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.
What do space travels hold out for us? Aliens? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v--IqqusnNQ&quot;&gt;Life on Mars&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqjDSbhobGY&quot;&gt;Planting potatoes on Mars&lt;/a&gt;? Before we can know for sure we need to find out what a prolonged stay in space will do to our brain. A NASA-funded study investigated just that and found that after being on the ISS for a while the brain gets -- quite literally -- spaced out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, with no gravity to pull it down, the brain floats upwards in the skull. Unfortunately there was no second post-space scan to see whether it eventually returns to the normal position or whether it stays upwards, reaching for the stars. Secondly, a fold on top of the brain separating motor areas from the sensory ones (called the central sulcus) got compressed and became narrower. On a long mission this might lead to changes in the brain function. In some cases, the upward brain shift was also thought to be responsible for the increased pressure on the optic nerve leading to some extent of vision damage (which is often reported by astronauts). Last but not least, the vessels carrying the cerebrospinal fluid (which cushions our brain and helps with clearing out waste and toxins) got narrower too, whereas the CSF-filled areas in the brain got larger. As the disturbances in the CSF flow are linked to a lot of diseases such as Alzheimer’s it would be handy to find out whether they are cause or effect of these diseases before sending people out on years-long space missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More studies need to be done before we can know for sure what the the significance of these changes is or how the brain reacts to a reduced gravity environment (think Mars), but once we’re through we’re ready to boldly go where no man has gone before!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I see a way to squeeze in some Bowie, I squeeze in some Bowie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6.
Normally, patients who have been in a vegetative state for more than a year are not very likely to regain consciousness which makes the case of a 35-year old French man even more stunning. After spending 15 years in a coma the patient partly recovered his consciousness after being subjected to electrical brain stimulation&lt;sup data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)30964-8&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vagus nerve played the central role in this miraculous recovery so let’s get to know this guy a little better.  Vagus nerve is a complex nerve running from your brain to several body areas and controlling unconscious body procedures such as heart rate. Moreover it is directly or indirectly connected to several brain areas including thalamus, amygdala and hippocampus all of which play important roles in conscious awareness. It also connects to locus coeruleus which plays a role in alertness and attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what the researchers did was to zap this nerve every day for six months. Soon after the beginning of the treatment he started opening his eyes more often, while after one month he was able to track objects with his eyes and turn his head when requested. Electrical activity in his brain reflected these changes -- brain waves which have been absent before were now observed. Basically a shift from no consciousness to minimal consciousness occured, all thanks to the stimulation of one nerve. Despite apparent (albeit minimal) success it is a very long way before we can understand how and why exactly this worked (question about the nature of consciousness, everybody) and generalize it for other patients locked in the vegetative state. But hey, first steps and all!&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/29/safety-nets-travel-after-brain-injury/"/>

		<updated>2017-12-29T16:30:21+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;There’s so much out there that beckons—family, friends, ethnic textiles, and, more recently, the writers’ world. I am compelled to answer the call—all the calls! I reject the invalid role that my bloody brain repeatedly tries to thrust on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to live a full life, I’ve had to learn to set up safety nets wherever I go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/09/antidepressant-may-benefit-traumatic-brain-injury/&quot;&gt;brain injury&lt;/a&gt;, I had no difficulty living a fast-paced life. I combined a full-time job with a variety of extra curricular activities including time-consuming hobbies, such as weaving and dragon boating. Travel was an integral part of my life, with trips to conferences,  workshops, and with family and friends at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in the wake of my injury, I can’t do nearly as much. Tasks that in my past life were a matter of course, such as grocery shopping and driving, deplete my resources. Travel now drains me, especially when it involves flying. Contending with the high volumes of sensory input streaming in at airports and in flight wears me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had to learn to apply coping mechanisms and compensation techniques to function with my damaged brain. Though pacing myself to prevent debilitating &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/10/26/understanding-chronic-fatigue-syndrome/&quot;&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt; would seem easy to apply, for me, it is one of the hardest adjustments I’ve had to implement. When I travel, it’s especially difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’m outside my home territory, having less control over the agenda hampers any attempts to slow down. Also, I don’t want people to worry. I don’t want to call attention to myself. I don’t want to miss out, and I don’t want to slow others down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another obstacle in my way is that future events, including possible sources of trouble, now mean less to me. As far as I’m concerned, much of the future is abstract. It’s as if the wiring between cause and effect, between my notion of past and future, is faulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trips often don’t seem real until I actually land at the destination. As a result, planning and preparations don’t make sense. I usually pack for an upcoming trip at the last moment, and when I finally get to it, I have to force myself to do it. In my mind, there’s no good reason for me to undertake a task that now feels so overwhelming in its complexity. Since the injury, poor organizational skills and the difficulties in managing high volumes of data—figuring out what I need to pack, how to arrange it in my luggage, what bags should I take—are daunting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In time, as I healed, I became better able to manage my bloody brain. I learned to set myself a list of unbreakable rules that help me prepare for trips. A side effect of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/04/01/traumatic-brain-injury-can-deep-sleep-be-neuroprotective/&quot;&gt;brain injury&lt;/a&gt;, a strong OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) streak, has a surprising benefit: I have a list of basics I need to pack that I follow religiously, plus a set way to organize items in my suitcase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My rules also include arranging for safety nets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew the trip to visit my family in Israel would be grueling. I knew better than to trust my own judgment. If I hoped to convince my bloody brain to cooperate, I needed someone to watch out for me, to keep me out of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the trip to Israel, I spoke to my sister about my anxiety. She understood and empathized—she’s walked in my shoes. She too has cavernous &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/10/04/in-and-out-of-the-abyss-depression-after-brain-surgery/&quot;&gt;angiomas&lt;/a&gt; that have bled. Like me, she is often tempted to outpace herself. But unlike me she is assertive, and when all hell breaks loose with her bloody brain, she knows to take it easy and to rest despite outside pressure. I, on the other hand, have trouble protecting myself, no matter how bad shape I’m in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the trip, she shielded me from ambitious plans from well-meaning family and friends who wanted me to participate in activities that would drain my resources. And she also shielded me from myself; I was excited to spend time with my family, not wanting to cause concern, reluctant to disappoint, and too willing to go along with the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the safety nets don’t always work. Some of the changes that the bloody brain brought about get in the way. I am more emotionally volatile now, and often, my emotions drive me instead of reason. In addition, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/12/22/uncovering-the-secrets-of-memory-to-reverse-damage-in-alzheimers-patients/&quot;&gt;impaired memory&lt;/a&gt; and poor grasp of the connection between cause and effect often results in me downplaying potential difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my first couple of days in Israel, I didn’t listen to my sister’s advice. I was sure I knew better and that I would be fine. Even after the bloody brain lashed out at me with a crippling headache, I felt that she was being overprotective. I did finally listen to her—not because I fully agreed with her, but because I didn’t want to upset her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my brain rewired post-injury, my memory and my ability to make connections improved. As my self-awareness grew and I became more in-tune with myself and the bloody brain, planning ahead was easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even now, more than a decade since the surgeries, when I realize that common sense says, “wait a bit, take a break, don’t do so much,” there is still a niggling little voice inside me telling me that it’s not &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; necessary. I still overstretch myself, though nowhere near as much as I used to. I’m doing better now, I’ll be fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, where did I put that safety net?&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/drink-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beverage industry has done such a good job in convincing the public that sugary and alcoholic beverages are something they want to purchase and drink, it’s almost impossible with facts and arguments to convince them otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not your imagination; populations around the world are getting fatter and sicker every year. Diabetes rates are skyrocketing, childhood obesity is at an all-time high, and waistlines are growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it can be argued that multiple factors are responsible for this change in human health, it is undeniable that sugary, carbonated and alcoholic drinks contribute to a less healthy population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How exactly has the beverage industry pulled off this feat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One word: marketing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there has been a multitude of studies conducted on how to use marketing campaigns to convince the public to do or buy something, in a unique &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4972-6&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; recently conducted by Dr. Melanie Wakefield and colleagues, the researchers looked at not what convinces people to drink, but what strategies convince the public most on why they should not add these toxic – but highly popular – liquids to their diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wakefield et al. set out to determine what would be most effective, from a public advocacy position, in convincing consumers to support taxation and sport sponsorship bans of these chemical drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9729 alignright&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/Beer_mug_in_Tokyo_-_October_2017-300x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was designed in two waves; in the first wave, study participants were placed in different categories of exposure to health advocacy information. The different exposures were as follows: control messages (basic information of the public health issues associated with these drinks); standard policy arguments alone; standard policy arguments with an inoculation message; standard policy arguments with a narrative message; and standard policy arguments with an inoculation message and a narrative message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inoculation message is where the data presenter, by either audio or video means, will warn the listeners of what the other industry might say to counter their message, and why their message is wrong. A narrative message is defined as a story or experience from a person who has a personal connection to the policy, and is telling it from a personal standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the five groups were exposed to these messages, they completed questionnaires on what they thought of them, and how likely there were to influence their behavior and support of a public policy that made it more difficult for beverage companies to market their product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second wave of the study, approximately two weeks later, these same participants completed the questionnaires after they had been exposed to the brand marketing of the beverage companies, to see if they could be swayed after they had been educated by the public policy advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this experimental setup is certainly interesting in terms of its impact on the drink industry, one can also see how this study can shed light on how to convince and educate the public on other pressing public matters, where a private industry has well established and deep rooted marketing campaigns in place to financially benefit corporations and combat any messages of resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that advocacy messages incorporating inoculation or narrative components can increase public resilience to subsequent anti-policy messages. Across two policy domains (sugary drinks and alcohol) and tactics (taxation and sport sponsorship bans), inoculation and narrative messages &lt;em&gt;delivered separately &lt;/em&gt;were successful in countering the persuasive impact of opposing arguments from the sugary drink and alcohol industry as measured by participants’ level of support for the health policy being addressed in the message and the strength of their anti-industry beliefs after exposure to the anti-policy message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that there was limited evidence of immediate effects of the inoculation and narrative messages compared to the control, with some suggestion that the inoculation messages counter the persuasive messages of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, policy support and anti-industry beliefs were lower following exposure to the industry anti-policy messages at the second wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there were a number of limitations to this study, it’s not hard to reconcile these results with what is occurring in the real world, and the ever increasing influence large corporations have on buying, eating, drinking, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the study cautions, important message effects can be overlooked when focused solely on the immediate effects of exposure to advocacy messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, not all of the results from this study were bleak; there is some evidence that dissemination of advocacy messages can work, though more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Too much of anything can be dangerous, and social media is no exception. Today many of us spend more time on internet-enabled devices than even sleeping. Due to this overindulgence in social media and the internet, we may become socially reclusive rather than inclusive. This, in turn, may lead to various physical and mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, around two billion residents of our planet are online. Hundreds of millions of emails and social messages are exchanged each day. Perhaps, this online over-engagement is becoming more of a problem. The amount of time we spend online and on &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2010/07/06/social-media-and-mental-health/&quot;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; is increasing each year. It is estimated that most people spend more than two hours each day on social media in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although social media anxiety and addiction are still not recognized as individual disorders, most investigations support the view that mental issues related to internet overuse are on the rise. Moreover, it seems to be a particularly big problem in younger people. Most individuals nowadays have their first exposure to the internet while in school. Overuse of the internet may lead to problems with concentration, sleep deprivation, failure to exercise, anxiety, and even depression. Although studying the prevalence of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/02/20/digital-dieting-to-prevent-life-destroying-internet-addiction/&quot;&gt;internet addiction&lt;/a&gt; or social media addiction is challenging, it could be affecting as many as 10% of people in certain sections of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is social media engagement a disorder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is social media engagement itself a disorder? Perhaps the answer is both yes and no. It is no secret that some people get too submerged in the internet and social media. They feel bad if they do not get likes or see negative comments on their posts, and may even get depressed. Many others, however, think that social media is helpful in overcoming loneliness and&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/08/new-target-in-brain-for-treating-depression-the-bmp-pathway/&quot;&gt; depression&lt;/a&gt;, having a positive effect on self-esteem. The supporters of social media are saying that the compulsion to go online is not associated with the kind of harm done by substance abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most scientific review studies have provided mixed results, with only one thing certain: not all users gets depressed or feel anxiety with social media, but some do. For mental disorders related to internet abuse, as with any other psychological issues, there have to be predisposing factors like genetics, personality, lifestyle, other diseases, or a recent history of trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk factors and identification of social media disorder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of the contradicting findings, there is still no doubt that social media disorder exists, and some people are at higher risk of developing it than others. Some individuals are more prone to get dependent on the internet, cultivate impulsive behavior, and are inclined towards risky internet use, as well as being more susceptible to social and emotional impairment, and even physical harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, some tools and measures have been developed to qualify and quantify the disorders related to social media and internet overuse. One of the scales that can be used to measure social media disorder assesses several items over the period of one year—preoccupation, tolerance, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/05/13/debunking-the-myths-of-marijuana-withdrawal-syndrome/&quot;&gt;withdrawal&lt;/a&gt;, persistence, displacement (neglecting other hobbies), problems (arguments on social media), deception, escape, and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media addiction and neural changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some anatomical brain structures are well known to be associated with mood, emotion, and learning. Hence in one investigation, specific attention was given to the structures involved in the limbic system and reward pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, 20 subjects known to be addicted to social media were examined for any morphological changes in the brain, with the help of MRI. The study identified changes characteristic of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/04/17/deciphering-troubled-teens-risk-taking-behavior/&quot;&gt;impulsive behavior&lt;/a&gt;, with a bilateral decrease in grey matter in the amygdala without any changes in the nucleus accumbens. In contrast to other types of addiction, the anterior and mid-cingulate cortex was not found to be impaired in social media addiction, indicating that the inhibitor function of these structures is well-preserved in this condition. The study demonstrated both similarities and differences between the structural changes in the brain in social media addiction and in addiction related to substance abuse or gambling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other health aspects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media is a powerful tool that affects multiple facets of life. It has an additive effect on our already increasing sedentary lifestyle. Hence it is not stretch of the imagination that is is related to increased risk of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/28/effect-of-obesity-on-human-brain/&quot;&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, insulin resistance, cardiovascular ailments, and other non-communicable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who use social media too often are also more prone to &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/02/cyber-psychology-part-ii-dealing-with-the-dark-mind-of-internet-trolls/&quot;&gt;bullying&lt;/a&gt;. They may get involved in risky behavior more frequently. In some people, social media addiction may also lead to disturbed sleep patterns. Moreover, adolescents are considered to be at higher risk of developing an addiction to social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management of social media or internet addiction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment of social media addiction-related pathologies depends on the nature of the problem. Although there is a lack of trials and evidence for treatment of social media-related mental issues, treatment is often a combination of pharmacological drugs and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2012/10/05/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-for-bulimia-nervosa-a-success-story/&quot;&gt;cognitive-behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; (CBT)—the kind of treatment that has already shown efficacy in other types of addictions, anxiety, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although at present there are very few clinical studies on the topic, one can surmise that social media-related addiction, anxiety, depression, and other mental issues are going to become more common. It would be unwise to think that of social media disorder as merely a habit, we should keep in mind the related structural changes in the brain, imparting serious problems for an affected person.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this (50th!) episode of Brain Matters, Anthony talks to Dr. Fred Wolf (Assistant Professor, UC Merced). Dr. Wolf is interested in how alcohol and other drugs of abuse change our genes when we take them. Using the fruit fly as a model organism, he is able to use powerful techniques to delve into the complex relationship between drugs, genes, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wolf helps run his own biology podcast, &lt;a href=&quot;http://radiobio.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RadioBio&lt;/a&gt;, with graduate students at UC Merced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The music on today’s podcast was by &lt;a href=&quot;https://kolezanka.bandcamp.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;koleżanka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen and subscribe on &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/brain-matters/id730239508?mt=2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

For the eighth consecutive year, the American Society for Cell Biology (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascb.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ASCB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) has supported interested cell biology labs in the creation of video projects describing their work for interpretive and educational value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_7934&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7934 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/12/celldancpostersforwebcrop-300x225.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Posters advertising past Celldance videos, courtesy of ASCB&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascb.org/celldance/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Celldance video program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; provides participating labs financial support to develop video stories of their cell motility research, in addition to post-production assistance for sound and editing services. PLOS supports this ASCB &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascb.org/community-committee/public-information/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Public Information Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; program that helps showcase the value of basic research, aids in communicating complex scientific concepts to the public and provides scientists a unique opportunity to fine-tune their &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/scicomm/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;communication skills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, two labs working in collaboration and a third lab developed Celldance videos for presentation at the joint ASCB|EMBO 2017 Annual Meeting. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mullinslab.ucsf.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dyche Mullins’ lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; at the University of California, San Francisco, in collaboration with the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fritzlaylinlab.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lillian Fritz-Laylin lab&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, created a video honoring foundational research on actomyosin and muscle movement by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/WG/p-nid/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Albert Szent-Gyorgyi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and describing how the molecules that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020091&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;constitute the cell’s skeleton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, or cytoskeleton, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000201&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;influence the way a cell moves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; through both wide open and narrow matrices. The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/pathogenesis-of-vascular-infections/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Guillaume Duménil lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; at the Institut Pasteur created a video that emphasizes the value of cohesive basic and clinical research programs and describes the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003139&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;group’s studies on infection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; caused by the Gram-negative bacterium &lt;em&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/em&gt;, responsible for meningitis and sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons the Mullins lab submitted work to the ASCB Celldance contest was to be able to convey the fundamental importance of molecular and cellular motion to a general audience. Mullins appreciates that fundamental problems in cell biology are often challenging to explain to non-specialists. Article types such as PLOS Research Matters, for both &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.plos.org/research-matters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.plos.org/research-matters-biology&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, can help in this regard, by enhancing public understanding of science and the benefits of basic research to public health, society, life, and the environment. In addition, “A short film can explain concepts that are extremely difficult to convey in a brief elevator conversation or even a long lecture,” says Mullins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paring down several initial ideas the group wanted to convey was key to creating a coherent narrative. The team decided to begin with the importance of molecular and cellular motion, then to introduce the idea that “this is a universal feature of life, even microscopic life living in ponds,” says Mullins. Once the images were in place, the team experimented with audio voice-overs but eventually settled on captions to guide the viewer through the story. “It’s like an old-fashioned silent movie,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes even scientists need help understanding what they see under the microscope. Fascinating &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/at-work/test-and-measurement/crafting-light-to-illuminate-life-from-single-molecules-on-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;3D lattice light sheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; movies of crawling cells from the Fritz-Laylin lab were also motivation for wanting to participate in Celldance. “There is so much information in these movies that we had a hard time understanding what we were seeing,” says Mullins. By enlisting the help of visualization experts, the research teams could “suddenly see a wealth of new details. We were no longer seeing cells as ghostly apparitions, barely discernible at the business end of a microscope, but as real, three-dimensional beasts. We wanted to share this experience with a wider audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Says Duménil of his Celldance experience, “From a scientific point of view, I find it useful to see an infection as a story that starts with the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000314&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;encounter of the pathogen and its host&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the story develops with the different stages of the infection, cellular barriers are crossed, cells invaded, organs infected and the outcome can be happy or sad.” For Duménil, the opportunity was not only about explaining science to the public in an accessible format. It was also, he says, “an opportunity to show the people who do the actual research and our lab environment at the Institut Pasteur.” For more on the work of the Duménil lab and their video, see the partner Celldance blog on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2017/12/22/2017-ascb-celldance/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Speaking of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(text and link updated 1/2/2018).&lt;/p&gt;

It has a reputation as the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982207017794&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fear center&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438896800766&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emotion center&lt;/a&gt;” of the brain, although it performs &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1965-04035-001&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;as we've known for well over 50 years&quot;&gt;multiple functions&lt;/a&gt;. One well-known activity of the amygdala, via its connections with other &lt;a href=&quot;http://whoville.ucsd.edu/PDFs/177_Squire%20&amp;amp;%20ZolaMorgan_Sci_1991.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The Medial Temporal Lobe Memory System (PDF)&quot;&gt;MTL&lt;/a&gt; areas, involves an enhancement of memories that are emotional in nature (compared to neutral). Humans and rodents with damaged or inactivated amygdalae fail to show this emotion-related enhancement, although memory for neutral items is relatively preserved (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10456070&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Adolphs et al., 1997&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9115384&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Phelps &amp;amp; Anderson, 1997&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23754441&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;McGaugh, 2013&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new brain stimulation study  (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/12/1714058114&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inman et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;) raises interesting questions about the &lt;i&gt;necessity&lt;/i&gt; of subjective emotional experience in the memory enhancement effect. A group of 14 refractory epilepsy patients underwent surgery to implant electrodes in the left or right amygdala (and elsewhere) for the sole purpose of monitoring the source of their seizures. In a boon for affiliated research programs everywhere, patients are able to  participate in experiments while waiting around for seizures to  occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stimulating electrodes were located in or near the basolateral complex of the amygdala (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15084662&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;important for conditioned fear memories&quot;&gt;BLA&lt;/a&gt;), shown below. The stimulation protocol was developed from similar studies in rats, which demonstrated that direct electrical stimulation of BLA can improve memory for non-emotional events when tested on subsequent days (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22141467&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bass et al., 2012&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24211699&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26030426&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cOvJ_UO7ae4/WjnZdHYZzWI/AAAAAAAAMXw/0QSnJ2lAu2YYp2Mb-J0WpKBsKzhFOFyWQCLcBGAs/s1600/Fig1_Inman_anatomy.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;310&quot; data-original-width=&quot;667&quot; height=&quot;185&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cOvJ_UO7ae4/WjnZdHYZzWI/AAAAAAAAMXw/0QSnJ2lAu2YYp2Mb-J0WpKBsKzhFOFyWQCLcBGAs/s400/Fig1_Inman_anatomy.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fig-label&quot;&gt;Fig. 1A and B (modified from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fig-label&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/12/1714058114&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inman et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt; A representative postoperative coronal MRI showing electrode contacts in the amygdala (white square). &lt;b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt; Illustration of left amygdala with black circles indicating estimated centroids of bipolar stimulation in or near the BLA in all 14 patients.

These and other studies [in animals] have led to the view that an emotional experience engages the amygdala, which in turn enhances memory for that experience through modulation of synaptic plasticity-related processes underlying memory consolidation in other brain regions. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;This model predicts that direct stimulation of the human amygdala could enhance memory in a manner analogous to emotion’s enhancing effects on long-term memory. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The experimental task was a test of object recognition memory. Pictures of 160 neutral objects were presented on Day 1 while the participants made “indoor” or “outdoor” decisions (which were quite ambiguous in many cases). The purpose of this task was to engage a deep level of semantic encoding of each object, which was presented for 3 seconds. Immediately after stimulus offset for half the items (n=80), a train of electrical stimulation pulses was presented for 1 second (each pulse = 500 μs biphasic square wave; pulse frequency = 50 Hz; train                                     frequency = 8 Hz). For the other half (n=80), no stimulation was presented. Each trial was separated by a 5 second interval. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BoCqud2oPuk/WjnZj9jgsCI/AAAAAAAAMX0/Pe0s-9Xuz50Y2n0XQYaiA1T0M-GCkQUrQCLcBGAs/s1600/Fig1_Inman_task%2Bdesign.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;398&quot; data-original-width=&quot;657&quot; height=&quot;241&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BoCqud2oPuk/WjnZj9jgsCI/AAAAAAAAMX0/Pe0s-9Xuz50Y2n0XQYaiA1T0M-GCkQUrQCLcBGAs/s400/Fig1_Inman_task%2Bdesign.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fig-label&quot;&gt;Fig. 1D (modified from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fig-label&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/12/1714058114&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inman et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An immediate recognition memory test was presented after completion of the study phase. Yes/no decisions were made on 40 old objects with post-stimulation, 40 old objects with no stimulation, and 40 new objects (“foils”). Then 24 hours later, a similar yes/no recognition test was presented, but this time with the other set of items not tested previously, along with a new set of foils. The prediction was that electrical stimulation of the amygdala would act as an artificial “boost” of performance on the 24 hour test, after memory consolidation had occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This prediction was (mostly) supported as shown below, with one caveat I'll explain shortly. In &lt;b&gt;Panel A&lt;/b&gt;, a commonly used measure of discrimination performance (&lt;a href=&quot;https://memory.psych.mun.ca/models/recognition/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;d prime&quot;&gt;d′&lt;/a&gt;) is shown for the Immediate and One-Day tests, with &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;red dots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; indicating stimulation and &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;blue dots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; no stimulation (one dot per patient). Most participants performed better on stimulated items regardless of whether on the Immediate test or One-Day test, although variability was higher on the Immediate test. &lt;b&gt;Panel B&lt;/b&gt; shows a summary of the performance difference for stimulation &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;−&lt;/span&gt; no stimulation trials. Paired-samples &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests (two sided) were conducted for each recognition-memory interval. The result for One-Day was significant (p=.003), but the result for Immediate was not (p=.30). This would seem to be convincing evidence that amygdala stimulation during encoding enhanced delayed recognition memory &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;selectively&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hWAPeB5u7L4/WjnZm6qDwsI/AAAAAAAAMX4/XdPpbxOhzw8FYhNy3JX19Rqn0hbQFJycQCLcBGAs/s1600/Brief%2Belectrical%2Bstimulation%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bamygdala.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;538&quot; data-original-width=&quot;652&quot; height=&quot;330&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hWAPeB5u7L4/WjnZm6qDwsI/AAAAAAAAMX4/XdPpbxOhzw8FYhNy3JX19Rqn0hbQFJycQCLcBGAs/s400/Brief%2Belectrical%2Bstimulation%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bamygdala.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fig-label&quot;&gt;Fig. 2A and B (modified from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fig-label&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/12/1714058114&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inman et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, from the statistics presented thus far, we don't know whether the memory enhancement effect was &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;statistically&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; larger for the One-Day test. My guess is not, because an ANOVA showed a main effect of test day (p&amp;lt; 0.001) and a main effect of stimulation (p= 0.03). But no interaction between these variables was reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, the study was fascinating because the patients were unable to say whether or not stimulation was delivered in a subsequent test of awareness (10 trials of each condition):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;All 14 patients denied subjective awareness of the amygdala stimulation on every trial. In addition, no patient  reported emotional responses associated with amygdala stimulation during the stimulation awareness test or during  recognition-memory testing. Moreover, similar amygdala-stimulation  parameters caused no detectable autonomic changes in patients (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 7) undergoing stimulation parameter screening.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The take-home message is that subjective and objective indicators of emotion were not necessary for amygdala stimulation during encoding to enhance subsequent recognition &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;of neutral material&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. “This memory enhancement was accompanied by neuronal oscillations during retrieval that  reflected increased interactions between the amygdala, hippocampus, and  perirhinal cortex”&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (as had been shown previously in animals).&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it seems that subjective emotional experience may be an unnecessary epiphenomenon for the boosting effect of emotion in the formation of declarative memories. Or at least in this limited (albeit impressive) laboratory setting. And here I will step aside from being overly critical. Anyone who wants to slam the reproducibility of an n=14 rare patient sample size should be prepared to run the same study with 42 individuals with amygdala depth electrodes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/12/1714058114&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inman et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;For [n = 5 patients] with electrodes localized concurrently in the amygdala, hippocampus, and perirhinal cortex), local field potentials (LFPs) from each region were recorded simultaneously during the immediate and one-day recognition-memory tests... LFP oscillations were apparent in the theta (here 5–7 Hz) and gamma (30–55 Hz) ranges...  ...  Recognition during the one-day test but not during the immediate test exhibited increased power in perirhinal cortex in the gamma frequency range for remembered objects previously followed by stimulation compared with remembered objects without stimulation. Furthermore, LFPs during the one-day test, but not during the immediate test, revealed increased coherence of hippocampal–perirhinal oscillations in the theta frequency range for remembered objects previously followed by stimulation compared with remembered objects without stimulation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you think the 14 patients with epilepsy were variable, wait until you see the [&lt;i&gt;overly honest&lt;/i&gt;] results from even smaller studies with rats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vpu-pku1uo4/Wj7YKrn8BtI/AAAAAAAAMYg/up-eHhQQtDggOBbvg92D9XvNSwpQbg7WwCLcBGAs/s1600/Fig%2BS7%2B-%2Brats%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bleft%252C%2Bhumans%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bright.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;513&quot; data-original-width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;301&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vpu-pku1uo4/Wj7YKrn8BtI/AAAAAAAAMYg/up-eHhQQtDggOBbvg92D9XvNSwpQbg7WwCLcBGAs/s400/Fig%2BS7%2B-%2Brats%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bleft%252C%2Bhumans%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bright.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fig-label&quot;&gt;Fig. S7 (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fig-label&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/12/1714058114&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inman et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conveniently, Professor Dorothy Bishop has a new blog post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2017/12/using-simulations-to-understand.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Using simulations to understand the importance of sample size&lt;/a&gt;.

 &lt;p&gt;A fortunate knock of luck is always welcomed by scientists and researchers, yet any treatment modalities should be novel by design rather than by serendipity. Antidepressants were discovered by chance in the 1950s, and it seems that they suffer from specific deficiencies when it comes to their clinical effectiveness and safety profile. It is something that very few in the medical field negate, although the degree of disagreement may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depression—a poorly understood disorder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/02/08/winter-depression-new-discoveries-in-treatment-of-seasonal-affective-disorder/&quot;&gt;Depression &lt;/a&gt;is a heterogeneous disorder that may be characterized by a group of common symptoms, but the underlying cause may vary from person to person. Despite considerable research about the structural and neurochemical changes caused in the brain of a person suffering from depression,  there is no specific brain-based test for the condition. Two of the most widely accepted diagnostic systems, ICD-10 and DSM-IV, have similar but not identical criteria. This means that they have a different threshold for various depression symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the universally accepted symptoms of depression are depressed mood, fatigue, loss of interest, worthlessness, recurrent thoughts of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/10/back-to-school-suicides/&quot;&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt;, insomnia, and alternation in appetite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rise of antidepressants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the US- and European-based statistics show a sharp increase in the prescription of antidepressants since the 1990s. Although statistics also indicate that no more than 8% of the population suffers from depression, 13% are taking &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/07/is-placebo-more-powerful-than-antidepressants-and-psychotherapy/&quot;&gt;antidepressants&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, these drugs are much more commonly used in people above 60 years of age, with almost one-fourth of them taking antidepressants and many older adults using them for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a rise in the use of antidepressants is also explained by the fact that these drugs are given not only to treat depression. They have become a kind of all-purpose drugs that are considered useful to treat various mood disorders, painful conditions, inflammatory bowel syndrome, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/02/14/got-anxiety-got-smarts/&quot;&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, panic disorders, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How antidepressants work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antidepressants are drugs belonging to various groups. Almost all of them work by changing the level of monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain. There are some additional effects too, as not all drugs capable of altering monoaminergic functioning may work as antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antidepressants change the presynaptic and postsynaptic concentration of dopamine, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/04/phobias-part-ii-new-social-anxiety-treatments-mdma-testosterone-less-serotonin/&quot;&gt;serotonin&lt;/a&gt;, and norepinephrine in the neurons, with most modern antidepressants targeting serotonin and to some extent norepinephrine. Dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine are vital neurotransmitters, playing an essential role in the limbic system and reward system. The drugs help to reset these systems, consequently contributing to the regain of mood and emotional balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antidepressants have been shown to increase the activation of the prefrontal cortex but decrease the activation of the hippocampus, parahippocampal region, amygdala, ventral anterior cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. These areas of the brain play an important role in shaping mood and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/26/do-insects-have-emotions-and-empathy/&quot;&gt;emotions&lt;/a&gt; and are part of limbic and reward systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from modifying the transmission of monoaminergic neuromediators, antidepressant drugs also have a complex effect on various receptors and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. The impact of some of the novel antidepressants on different serotonin receptors (e.g., 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors) has been well-studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most commonly used antidepressants these days are tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and selective serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the safety issues?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about drug safety, it is not just about the adverse effect but also about the clinical efficacy. Too many side effects and little clinical effectiveness as compared to &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/07/the-neuroscience-behind-the-placebo-effect/&quot;&gt;placebo &lt;/a&gt;could put the utility of any drug therapy under doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to side effects, anticholinergic side effects like dryness of mouth, blurring of vision, and dizziness are common with most antidepressants. Most of them may also alter appetite and sexual function, and cause an upset stomach, joint and muscular pains, problems with drug interactions, irritability, mood changes, movement disorders and the risk of falling in the elderly, and much more. Moreover, these side effects continue to persist when the drugs are used long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of tolerance and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/22/from-abuse-to-addiction-the-withdrawal-period-makes-the-difference/&quot;&gt;withdrawal symptoms&lt;/a&gt; are widespread. Discontinuation syndrome can be really bad in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most worrisome of all the adverse effects is the higher occurrence of suicide and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2013/02/19/human-aggression-and-violence-a-necessary-evil/&quot;&gt;violence&lt;/a&gt; in those on antidepressants. Although there are many studies with contradicting conclusions, the majority seem to show that suicide and violence are much higher in those taking antidepressants. Moreover, abnormal behavior is equally common with the newer SSRIs and SSNRIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an abundance of literature mentioning the risk of suicide in depression. However, the efficacy of antidepressants in the prevention of depression-related suicide remains inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical studies have demonstrated that the newer non-tricyclic antidepressants are not any better in their safety profile in the elderly population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a considerable number of studies seems to put doubt on the effectiveness of antidepressants. Some medical specialists believe that antidepressants do not help at all, and many studies support their view. Thus in one of the studies published in the &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, it was concluded that the therapeutic benefit with antidepressants may actually be non-existent or minimal for mild to moderate depression, with more substantial benefits in severe cases of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the diversity of depression is well-recognized, almost all the drugs made to treat depression inhibit reuptake of one or another monoamine neuromediator, and very little has changed in our approach towards treatment since the advent of the first antidepressant drug. In order to overcome the dangers and limitations of therapy with antidepressants, there is an urgent need to create antidepressants that have a novel mechanism of action and better tolerance.  More caution should be exercised by medical professionals when prescribing anti-depressants, as the ability to promote positive effects in many patients is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9704 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;159&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/scale.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;A study of over 33,000 people indicates that public health strategies aiming to prevent adult weight gain in the whole population have the potential to prevent twice as many cases of type 2 diabetes as strategies that target individuals at high risk of diabetes due to being obese. Patrik Wennberg and colleagues have carried out an observational prospective cohort study, analysing data from 33,184 people aged 30-60 years who attended two health examinations 10 years apart between 1990 and 2013 as part of the Västerbotten Intervention Programme. They were then able to determine the association between change in body weight between baseline and 10 year follow-up and occurrence of newly diagnosed diabetes at 10 year follow-up, and assessed the impact of population-level shifts in body weight on the occurrence of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol warning labels – what do we know?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects of labeling on alcohol is an area that is generally poorly understood. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3956-2&quot;&gt;systematic review &lt;/a&gt;published this year examines the effects of ‘Low alcohol’ and equivalent labeling of alcohol, food and tobacco products on selection, consumptio&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9705 alignright&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/alcohol.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;n, and perceptions of products among adults. It finds that there is low quality evidence suggesting consumers’ perceptions of products could be shifted by low alcohol labeling; however, there is still considerable uncertainty over what the effects might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4055-8&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal at the beginning of the year explores the apparent ineffectiveness of warning labels on alcohol products. In their research, the authors theorize that the limited effect of warning labels may be due to consumers paying little attention to them. The lack of attention to warning labels, even among people who actively want to cut down, suggests that there is room for improvement in the content of health warnings on alcohol packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4271-2&quot;&gt;How can fuel taxation influence obesity?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9706 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;179&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/gaspump.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;Victoria Brown et al. have carried out a scoping review to assess the evidence for obesity or physical activity effect of changes in fuel price or taxation. Findings of the study suggest that increasing fuel excise taxation may be a cost-effective obesity prevention intervention. Victoria Brown discusses the research group’s findings further in a blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/05/04/effectiveness-increase-fuel-excise-taxation-potential-obesity-prevention-intervention/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4090-5&quot;&gt;Exercise can help prevent Alzheimer’s and other dementias&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, Martin Ginis and her cohort review data from more than 150 research articles about the impact of physical activity on people with Alzheimer’s. The work explores how physical activity improves the patient’s quality of life and examines the risk of developing Alzheimer’s based on the amount of activity in which an individual participated. Dr Ginis et al.’s project has demonstrated how research evidence can be used to formulate evidence-based messages and knowledge products that can be disseminated by public health and other organizations to promote the use of physical activity to prevent and manage Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evelyn Pyper and colleagues find that, when children are made to go to bed at a certain time during the week, they are more likely to hit sleep guidelines. However, neither encouraging nor enforcing a bedtime has an effect on sleep at the weekend. The study uses self-reported figures from 1600 mums and dads with at least one child under the age of 18. Fifteen-year-olds show the greatest difference between weekday and weekend sleep, with 38.3 per cent fewer children meeting guidelines on the weekends compared to the weekdays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9707 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;159&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/drinking.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;Keeping teenagers happy could be the secret to stopping them from taking up drinking and smoking. Lead author Noriko Cable and colleagues use 1,729 available cases from adolescents aged between 10 and 15 who participated in waves 2 and 3 of the UK Longitudinal Household Study that has annually collected population representative data from 40,000 UK households. Youngsters were asked to rate their happiness related to school performance, looks, family, friends, school and life in general. The researchers find that the happiest children have a 74.4 per cent chance of being non-drinkers and smokers, compared to 43.7 per cent of the least happy. The study findings indicate that joint interventions to promote happiness and harm awareness could help young adolescents from engaging with drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4361-1&quot;&gt;Less active women have higher exercise expectations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study analyzes women’s activity levels, expectations and beliefs about exercise and their feelings about what makes them feel happy and successful. It finds that women who are less active have higher expectations of themselves to exerci&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9708 alignright&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/exercise.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;se more intensely and more frequently – which actually thwarts their motivation. Whereas high-active women seem to have more positive feelings from exercising, more sedentary women feel that, in order for exercise to be ‘valid’, it needs to be intense. Author Michelle Segar and colleagues conclude that there is a need to effectively get the message across that any movement is better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4394-5&quot;&gt;Parent’s perceptions of their children’s screen viewing time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russell Jago and colleagues have qualitatively examined parents’ perceptions of their 5–6-year-old child’s screen viewing (SV) within the context of their own quantitatively measured SV. They find that the majority of parents in this study who exceed the SV threshold express minimal concern and a relaxed approach to managing SV for themselves and their child(ren), suggesting a need to raise awareness among these parents about the time they spend engaging in SV. Author Catherine Draper discusses this important work further &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/06/01/do-as-i-say-and-do-as-i-do-the-influence-of-parents-screen-viewing-perceptions-and-behaviors-on-their-childrens-screen-viewing/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A systematic review published earlier this year finds that nine in ten office workers are low on vitamin D because they struggle to see enough of the sun. Researchers from the Alberta University in Canada demonstrate that shiftworkers, healthcare workers and indoor workers are at high risk to develop vitamin D deficiency, which may reflect key lifestyle differences.  Less than half of outdoor workers from areas such as gardening and construction are vitamin D deficient, compared with 78 per cent of those who work indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4573-4&quot;&gt;Health effects and psychosocial benefits of high heels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9709 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;140&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/heels.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;Previous studies and reviews have provided evidence that high heels are detrimental to health. However, the evidence base remains fragmented and no review has covered both the epidemiological and biomechanical literature. Max Barnish et al. have carried out a systematic review which shows that high heels bring psychosexual benefits to women but are detrimental to their health. The authors conclude that, in light of this dilemma, it is important that women’s freedom of choice is respected and that any remaining issues of explicit or implicit compulsion are addressed. Neil Cronin, one of the peer reviewers of this study, discusses the importance of the subject further in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/08/01/high-time-we-talked-about-high-heels-health-effects-social-pressures-shoe-choice/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4672-2&quot;&gt;Cell phone use while pregnant won’t harm baby’s brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study which examines data from around 45,000 mothers, finds no evidence that maternal cell phone use during pregnancy has a harmful effect on child neurodevelopment. In fact, the research finds that children are better at communicating aged three or five, perhaps because women who speak more on the phone also talk more to their children, helping them expand their vocabulary. Although concerns were recently raised after the babies of rats exposed to magnetic radiation from mobile phones were born with changes to their brains, the authors of this study say the exposure of unborn babies and rodents cannot be compared. Authors Jan Alexander and Eleni Papadopoulou talk in more detail about their study &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/09/05/hold-the-phone-cell-phone-use-while-pregnant-not-linked-to-child-neurodevelopment-problems/?utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;amp;utm_source=socialnetwork&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4685-x&quot;&gt;Effects of raising tobacco taxes across the EU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modelling a 10% tax increase on tobacco reveals that higher taxation would be considerably more effective in reducing consumption as well as incidences of smoking-related deaths in the two less developed regimes than in the remaining 24 countries (EU24) belonging to the third income regime. Price increases in Bulgaria and Romania have the greatest effects on reducing cigarette consumption among all EU countries, while experiencing a comparatively high prevalence of smoking. The results indicate that, since each regime is differently affected by cigarette taxation, different policies must be adopted to fight nicotine use. Christian Schafferer, author of the article, discusses the study findings in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/09/21/possible-effects-of-raising-tobacco-taxes-across-the-eu/?utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;amp;utm_source=socialnetwork&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4669-x&quot;&gt;Sexual harassment from work colleagues has a greater impact on mental health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Denmark include self-reported information on working conditions and health from 7603 employees and supervisors in 1041 organizations within 5 occupations. They find that exposure to workplace sexual harassment from clients or customers is significantly associated with a higher level of depressive symptoms; they also find that employees harassed by colleagues, supervisors or subordinates have a higher mean level of depressive symptoms than employees harassed by clients or customers. The results of the study underline the importance of investigating sexual harassment from clients or customers and sexual harassment by colleagues, supervisors or subordinates as distinct types of harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4875-6&quot;&gt;Dilemmas consumers face when purchasing meat products&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This large study is the first to investigate potential dilemmas between health and environmental considerations when purchasing animal food. The authors of the study specifically look at the socio-demographic profiles of individuals reporting health and &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9710 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;162&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/meatjpg.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;environmental dilemmas when purchasing meat, fish and dairy products, and compare the diet quality of individuals with and without dilemma. The cross-sectional study involves 22,936 subjects from the NutriNet-Santé cohort study. Results of the study show that around 10% of individuals are torn between health and environmental considerations when purchasing meat or fish, and this is the case for only 5% for dairy products. Older participants, women, and low income individuals are more likely to report facing this dilemma. Participants who report dilemmas for meat and dairy products consume less of these foods and have a better dietary quality overall. In addition, participants with a meat dilemma show better adherence to meat/fish/eggs guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4920-5&quot;&gt;Healthy diet, happy child&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louise Arvidsson and colleagues have investigated the bidirectional association between adherence to healthy dietary guidelines and children’s psychosocial well-being. They have also examined how the associations might differ between children with different weight status. It is the first study of its kind and the study findings are unique in that they are based on a large longitudinal study of children from different parts of Europe, adding to the largely cross-sectional, current evidence on diet and psychosocial health in children. The researchers examine 7,675 children two to nine years of age from eight European countries – Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Spain and Sweden. The study finds that a higher Healthy Dietary Adherence score at the beginning of the study period was associated with better self-esteem and fewer emotional and peer problems two years later. The associations in the study are found to go in both directions; better well-being is associated with consumption of fruit and vegetables in accordance with dietary guidelines, better self-esteem is associated with limited intake of refined sugars, good parent relations are associated with fruit and vegetable consumption according to guidelines, fewer emotional problems are associated with fat intake according to guidelines and fewer peer problems are associated with consumption of fruit and vegetables according to guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/%2010.1186/s12889-017-4948-6&quot;&gt;Unsociable people at greater risk for diabetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9717 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/friends-300x201.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Researchers have asked nearly 3000 participants of The Maastricht Study to fill out a questionnaire on their social networks in order to assess whether social network size, contact frequency, type of relationship (family, friends, acquaintances), living alone and social participation are associated with pre-diabetes, newly diagnosed and previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2DM). They find that, in men, lack of social participation is associated with 42% higher odds of T2DM and that living alone is associated with 94% higher odds of T2DM. These groups should therefore be recognized as a high-risk group in healthcare. The findings also support the idea that resolving social isolation may help prevent the development of T2DM and that social network size and and participation in social activities may be used as indicators of diabetes risk. Lead author of the study, Stephanie Brinkhues, explores the main findings of the study in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/12/19/with-a-little-help-from-my-friends-getting-people-out-of-social-isolation-could-help-prevent-type-2-diabetes/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h4&gt;We came, we saw, we did a little shopping&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*2TBvUBtQiaEjEysKbb2FPA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Credit: Pixabay&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the hell. Sorry, I mean: hello, and welcome to The Spike’s 2017 review of the year in neuroscience. Thank any-passing-deity-that-happens-to-be-listening I don’t have to write a review of the year in politics. The combined malevolent incompetence of the US President and UK government will likely exhaust all possible permutations of terms of abuse by June 2018; after that their increasingly demented decisions and pronouncements will pass without response because we’ll have used All The Words. Every single one. Even the French ones. Va te faire foutre Trump, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brains. That’s what we’re here for. Like zombies, but with an education. There’s been a lot of sound and fury in neuroscience this year. Highbrow publications like Quanta and MIT Technology Review have burst with neuroscience stories. &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt; published so many opinion articles that they had to dedicate an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/neuron/issue?pii=S0896-6273(16)X0012-8&quot;&gt;entire bloody issue &lt;/a&gt;to them. If there’s any sign that a field of science has reached peak hot air, its that one of its elite journals publishes an issue without science. And &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt; published &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/neuron/issue?pii=S0896-6273(15)X0022-5&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; in the space of 12 months (I’m aware of the irony of complaining about opinion pieces on a blog, thank you). Sound and fury; and many strong contenders for the Nobel Prize in Stating the Bleedin’ Obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what did you miss amongst the malestrom? Here for your delectation are four dispatches that arrived in 2017 from the more esoteric reaches of neuroscience. The type of neuroscience that could turn out to be epochal; or just plain old interesting. And what more can one ask?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1) Sleep little worm, don’t you cry; Manuel’s going to sing you a lullaby&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is a many splendored thing. It revitalises us, and cleans our brains. It seems essential for learning, and for creativity. We’d all like more of it. Without it, we die. Mammals need sleep so badly that, deprived of their slumber, bits of their brain will go to sleep independently of the rest while the animal is doing stuff. With awkward consequences. Horribly jet-lagged attendees at international conferences will recognise this as the bit during the poster session where you pitch head-first into the poster board while apparently still talking, because bits of your motor cortex have gone “god this is dull, I’m going to sleep”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we’d all like to know more about how the brain goes to sleep. But brains are big unwieldy beasts — how can we study how a whole brain goes to sleep? Manuel Zimmer and his team hit on a solution: study sleep in the tiny worm C Elegans. Yes, apparently worms with 302 neurons in their entire bodies fall asleep. Technically, it enters a state of lethargus: the worm goes offline, but there’s little evidence that it dreams (other than that mortifying recurring nightmare of being caught eating bacteria with its mouth open).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zimmer and team showed us the neural activity cycling around the entire brain while the worm turns (and wriggles), then abruptly halting as the worm slept. As many as 75 percent of its neurons shut up entirely; and the rest carried on being active, but in a way that was unrelated to their activity in waking. In other words, they entered a different global state — one that looked very much like a random walk around a fixed point (if you’re excited about such things. Which I am. But then I code dynamical systems models for fun. So, you know, don’t take my word for it). What we gained here is view of sleep not as a thing created by some detailed, discrete sleep “circuit”, but as a switch in the state of the entire brain’s dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this paper was also notable for the depths of its content. We often lament that papers in the most elite journals of science, the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;s and &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;s, are all mouth and no trousers: they report amazing results on the flimsiest of evidence. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1126/science.aam6851&quot;&gt;this paper, in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, spent the first few pages on a deep and detailed characterisation of how subtly different lineages of C Elegans (all the same species, remember) had different abilities to fall into the lethargic state, and how that changed over their development. It was like a firehose of deep science: no big picture, nothing flashy, but deep careful work to find the precise type of worm most suited to the question of what happens when worms sleep. In &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. Crazy shit. Is there hope yet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2) Would you like to hear voices?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auditory hallucinations. One would think that these were a trifle tricky to objectively research, seeing as they practically define the personal subjective experience. (Pretentious, moi?) Yet as hallucinations are a debilitating hallmark of schizophrenia and other cognitive disorders, knowing something of how the brain creates them would be rather useful. This year &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6351/596&quot;&gt;Phil Corlett and co hit on a neat idea:&lt;/a&gt; why not create auditory hallucinations both in healthy people and in people who spontaneously suffer from them? For if we then measure the difference in how easy it is to create hallucinations in the two groups, we might learn something about how the brains of hallucinators are operating differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For it turns out we can make ordinary people have auditory hallucinations. Nothing scary, just hearing something that isn’t there. It’s disarmingly simple: pair the flash of a light with a short sound that you can just about hear. Do that a lot. Then just flash the light on its own. Even ordinary people then report hearing the tone a good percentage of the time. So the crux of this new study was: let’s also do that in people who already hear auditory hallucinations and ask if they hear &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; hallucinated tones? And if so, why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer was: yes, yes they do. A lot more. And for much quieter sounds too. But the key insight here was that the authors used this data to make a model of “why”. And the answer was, predictably — prediction. Those pairings of light-and-sound set the brain up to make predictions. It predicts that the light means a sound is also present. So when the light flash comes alone, the brain goes right ahead and predicts a sound when none is present. In ordinary people, sometimes this prediction wins out against the sensory evidence that there was no sound, and a sound is heard where none is to be found. But in hallucinators this prediction dominated, so they heard many more fictional sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which all fits with an interesting theory of hallucinations, that they occur when the the brain starts adding too much credence to the predictions it makes, rather than using the information coming from the outside world. Like football pundits. Basically, the what-the-hell-is-Alan-Shearer-talking-about-now-did-he-even-watch-that-match theory of hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3) A major journal publishes a null result&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title of this bit is not a typographical error. &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/26801&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt; published a paper &lt;/a&gt;which was almost entirely about the absence of an effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2004, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/3839836&quot;&gt;a highly influential paper in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;suggested that Parkinson’s disease patients on and off their dopamine medication seemed to learn different things about the same task. Those on-medication learnt to pick options that were most likely to be rewarded, suggesting they learnt best from positive feedback. Those off-medication learnt to avoid options that were least likely to be rewarded, suggesting they learnt best from negative feedback (i.e. on missing out on a reward). This finding sparked an entire way of thinking about how dopamine controls learning through its effects on the lumps of neurons we call the basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1093/brain/aws083&quot;&gt;A paper in 2012&lt;/a&gt; suggested something was amiss. There Shiner and co reported that actually patients on and off-medication could learn the task the same, and learn it just as well as a control group. But what the patients couldn’t do was generalise what they had learnt when faced with new combinations of options — they were unable to take what they’d learnt and use it in new ways. So which was it? Does dopamine medication change the style of learning, or of the ability to adapt learnt information to new choices?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of the &lt;em&gt;eLife &lt;/em&gt;study this year from Liz Coulthard, lead-authored by John Grogan, was to get to the bottom of the mystery by repeating the whole study again, and in all possible combinations of whether the patients were on or off medication during learning or during testing. And they found nothing, nada, niente, not a sausage. Bugger all. They found no difference between patients and no difference between patients and controls on anything. And found it three times. A very convincing null result, all told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A huge amount of work, no “positive” result, and yet published in an elite journal. Slight downside is that our grasp of dopamine is now even more like a panda with its tongue caught in a Rubik’s Cube: painfully baffled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(4) Turning one nervous system into another.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many questions about how brains work can’t be answered in complex animals. Things like: can the same behaviour arise from different neural circuits?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Paul Katz knows how to get around these problems: use dumb-as-a-rock marine invertebrates. In a phenomenal piece of work that mammalian neuroscientists can only dream of, &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2017.05.016&quot;&gt;Sakurai and Katz&lt;/a&gt; took two closely-related species of swimming sea-slugs and showed that despite having the same swimming movement, and very similar neurons, the wiring between those neurons was different. The same behaviour, the same neurons, but different circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhythmic movements like swimming are produced by circuits that self-oscillate, that have neurons bursting with activity at regular intervals, each burst causing a muscle to contract. So S&amp;amp;K said: right, so these two circuits must produce the same bursting but in different ways. To prove this, they blocked the synapses of the same pair of neurons in both species. In one species, this let the other neurons drop into a patterns of slow bursting that didn’t quite line up right. In the other, this blockade totally destroyed bursting. Same neurons, different effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two sea-slugs have a common ancestor. So these two different circuits imply that evolution has driven divergent wiring of this circuit, yet kept the same behaviour. Evolution here was acting on the wires between neurons, not the types of neurons nor the types of transmitters they used. If true, this should mean that we could take one circuit and rewire it to match the other, and end up with the same firing patterns in both. Some science fiction gubbins right there. I mean, imagine if we could that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can. This is exactly what S&amp;amp;K did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start with, the simplified their task by blocking the same pair of neurons again, taking the circuit down to just four neurons in both species. Again, they got slow, wrong bursting in one; and sod all in the other. All that was different was two connections in the slow bursting circuit that were missing in the sod-all circuit. So they made those connections themselves — they made artificial synapses. They recorded from the source neuron, transformed that neurons’s output into the predicted set of small fluctuations it should cause in a neuron at the other end; and injected the resulting signal as electrical input into the target neuron. Voila, artificial synapse. Rinse and repeat for both missing connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And lo, the sod-all circuit started slow, wrong bursting in all the same ways in all the same neurons. They turned one animal’s nervous system into a different animal’s nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That high-pitched whining sound you can hear is mammalian neuroscientists quietly seething with jealousy. Sea slugs rock (©Angela Bruno’s PhD defense):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*TlAftb8Xoztjpo6WberoNg.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And 2017 had so much more. Rafael Yuste finally got to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/hail-hydra-doing-neuroscience-without-a-brain-9b47ddd5df47&quot;&gt;record ALL THE NEURONS&lt;/a&gt; (well, Christopher Dupre recorded all the neurons). The game-changing Neuropixels probe, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/2016-a-slightly-perplexed-review-of-neuroscience-89fe0db2f4a0&quot;&gt;trailed in last year’s review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1038/nature24636&quot;&gt;was finally published&lt;/a&gt;. Elsayed and Cunningham &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4617&quot;&gt;asked the awkward question&lt;/a&gt;: you know all that exciting stuff we keep finding in large populations of neurons — you know, those Nature papers — what if they’re just artifacts of adding up a lot of single neurons with really dull tuning and nothing to do with the special sauce of the “population’’ at all? They gave us a bunch of ways to test; and found there was some special sauce after all. Phew. We celebrated the 200th anniversary of “An Essay on the Shaking Palsy”, the tract by James Parkinson that launched the systematic study of neurological disorders. And we had the revelation that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/27725&quot;&gt;scientific papers have decreased in readability over the past few decades&lt;/a&gt;” — the authors missing the irony of this sentence. Yes, the words used in scientific papers have become more complex over time. And the worst offender? Genetics. But we knew that already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing we scientists perhaps under-appreciate is that — if you’re paying attention — you get to hear good news all the time. Of advances in our understanding of the natural world; of technological breakthroughs; of medical marvels. And, in these idiotic times of fractured nationalism, we get to hear about countries working together, about co-operation that transcends all differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iter.org/&quot;&gt;ITER &lt;/a&gt;reached the half-way mark. With nuclear fusion perhaps the only viable permanent solution to our simultaneous carbon and energy crises, and ITER being the only attempt on the table to get it working commercially in the near future, having it back on track can only be a wonderful thing. And as a collaboration between 35 countries who historically don’t get along all that well (including the US, Russia, China on the one hand, and China, Japan, and Korea on the other), it is also signifies that we can still pull together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better yet, a new synchrotron opened this year. Great, you’re thinking, another source of high intensity light for looking at crystals. Whoop-de-doop. Ah, but this one is the only synchrontron in the Middle East. Based in Jordan, but built by a collaboration between Iran, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, and Palestine. I’ll let you go back and read that list of countries again. Science again transcending conflict and politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and they called it: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sesame.org.jo/sesame/&quot;&gt;Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East.&lt;/a&gt; Yes, the official acronym is: SESAME. And the official funding project? Open SESAME. For a laugh. We’re going to be OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=a3e80bbd5e79&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike/2017-a-moderately-baffled-review-of-the-year-in-neuroscience-a3e80bbd5e79&quot;&gt;2017: a moderately baffled review of the year in neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-spike&quot;&gt;The Spike&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have long studied chimps and other animals with two principal, related aims: to find out the capabilities of the animal mind, and to discover what makes us truly unique, if anything. This is a challenging field. As any pet owner knows, it’s tempting to project a human interpretation onto animal behaviour. Researchers, especially when they’ve spent many years studying the same animal, can fall victim to this very bias (you’ll see a theme of this field is the powerful, close bonds frequently formed between psychologist and animal). At the same time, though, there is also a temptation to overestimate our human uniqueness. Which emotions and capabilities are exclusively human? Tool use, perspective taking and deceit were once contenders, but no more, and the list is getting shorter all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Digest feature post is a celebration of the contribution that animals have made to psychology, including eight that we’ve come to know on first-name terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32942&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hans the Horse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;CleverHans.jpg&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-32945&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;32945&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;CleverHans&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/cleverhans.jpg?w=845?w=730&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/cleverhans.jpg?w=845?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/cleverhans.jpg?w=845&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;730,490&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/12/21/10-of-the-most-famous-animals-in-psychology/cleverhans/&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/cleverhans.jpg?w=845&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extent to which animals are truly capable of human-like intelligence has dogged psychologists for over a hundred years. A horse nicknamed Clever Hans (Der Kluge Hans in his native tongue) seemed to answer that question in dramatic fashion through his public performances in Berlin in early 1900s. Trained by a maths teacher Wilhelm Von Ofsten for four years, Hans appeared not only capable of simple arithmetic and telling the time, but by using hoof taps to correspond to letters, he performed even more astonishing feats, like identifying artists from their paintings or the composers of melodies. The German board of Education launched an 18-month long enquiry and found no evidence of fraud. However, the psychologist Oscar Pfungst eventually deduced that Hans must be reading tell-tale cues from whomever was questioning him because he could only answer correctly when his interrogator was visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revelation highlighted some of the problems that have plagued animal psychology research ever since. Animals are highly receptive to human cues and many animal behaviours that seem impressive on the surface – and which seem to reveal complex animal cognition – may often have a simpler explanation (though Hans’ ability to read cues, even when humans tried to conceal them, remains an incredible feat in itself). Unfortunately, the story ends sadly. Hans was recruited into the German war effort and, depending on which account you believe, was killed in action or eaten by hungry soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pavlov’s Dogs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m cheating a little with this (and the final) entry by including a group of famous animals rather than an individual, but it only seems right to mention the dogs studied by the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov given their contribution to psychology. The reason Pavlov’s dogs feature in almost every introductory psychology class and textbook is because they revolutionised our understanding of learning, especially the principle of classical conditioning (detailed in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Pavlov/&quot;&gt;classic paper&lt;/a&gt; from 1927). Pavlov discovered classical conditioning almost by accident, when he noticed that his research dogs salivated when they heard cues that indicated to them that dinner was on the way. Pavlov soon found that he could get the dogs to salivate in response to almost any kind of previously meaningless cue, such as a bell, simply by pairing the bell repeatedly with the arrival of food. A challenge for later psychology research has often been to show that something more than basic learning processes, such as classical conditioning, are at play when animals perform apparently impressive feats of human-like intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Washoe the Chimp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long-running question in animal psychology has been whether human language can be taught to animals. Early in the last century, one idea was that our primate cousins might well be capable of human language if only they were raised in human culture. This prompted the wife and husband team of Luella and Winthrop Kellogg to raise the chimp &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/guy-simultaneously-raised-chimp-and-baby-exactly-same-way-see-what-would-happen-180952171/&quot;&gt;Gua&lt;/a&gt; in their home alongside their son. It ended in failure of course, with Gua unable to speak. Decades later – it’s strange it took so long – animal researchers realised non-human primates would never speak because of the anatomy of their mouth and vocal chords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognition of this anatomical fact led to an intense period of several decades of work that attempted to teach apes sign language and, later, communication by symbols on a picture board. The first chimp to be taught sign language was Washoe (hence why I’ve chosen her for this list, rather than other famous research chimps including Kanzi and Nim Chimpsky). Washoe hailed from West Africa and was adopted by another spousal psychologist team, Allen and Beatrix Gardner. Washoe eventually learned to use over 250 different signs (her obituary in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; in 2007 was headlined: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/science/01chimp.html&quot;&gt;Washoe, a Chimp of Many Words, Dies at 42&lt;/a&gt;). There is disagreement over whether Washoe ever really invented new words, such as the time she allegedly signed “water”, “bird” at the sight of a swan. However, witnessing this apparent linguistic improvisation was according to at least one commentator (Harvard psychologist Roger Brown) “like getting an SOS from outer space”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koko the Gorilla&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the ape language studies have involved chimps, but one particularly famous exception is Koko the Gorilla, who has been taught sign language (and exposed to spoken English) for decades by the psychologist Francine “Penny” Patterson. A few years ago Koko made headlines around the world when it was alleged by the Gorilla Foundation in California that she was mourning the passing of actor and comedian Robin Williams, who she’d met for an afternoon in 2001. A YouTube clip of their encounter (see above) has been viewed over three million times. Koko has also starred in her own books, including a children’s book, &lt;em&gt;Koko’s&lt;/em&gt; Kitten, and been the subject of several film documentaries, most recently a BBC programme, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07gxpd7&quot;&gt;Koko: The Gorilla Who Talks To People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “What we can really learn from this extraordinary science experiment turned love affair?” asks the film, highlighting in a nutshell one key problem with this entire field – the emotional closeness between researchers and the animals they study, challenging the pursuit of scientific objectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sad thing about the story of Koko and the other apes made famous by their part in psychological study is that the whole field has crashed, not only because of methodological criticism (most notably a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/primatecognitionlab/References/cananapecreateasentence.pdf&quot;&gt;devastating critique&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; in 1979 by Herbert Terrace, leader of the Nim Chimpsky project, in which he argued that ape language is not human-like and doesn’t feature real syntax), but also amid accusations of animal mistreatment. A recent &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/08/koko_kanzi_and_ape_language_research_criticism_of_working_conditions_and.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; summed up the situation: “No new studies have been launched in years, and the old ones are fizzling out. A behind-the-scenes look at what remains of this research today reveals a surprisingly dramatic world of lawsuits, mass resignations, and dysfunctional relationships between humans and apes.” Similarly, a major new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-anthro-102116-041723&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Annual Reviews of Anthropology &lt;/em&gt;by Don Kulick says, “The threadbare field left today is an alarming not-so-funhouse of intrigue, betrayal, accusation, threats, litigation, dismissals, obese apes (unsurprising when most of their signing seems to be concerned with obtaining food rewards), dead apes, mass resignations, and even, inevitably, sex.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Peter the Dolphin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex is also a surprising theme of dolphin research that took place in the 1960s at a lab known as Dolphin House, built on the Caribbean island of Saint Thomas. There, John Lilley and his wife conducted investigations into whether dolphins are capable of mimicking human speech, and later into the effects of LSD on dolphins (to their surprise, the drug seemed to have no effect). As part of the language research, a woman called Margaret Howe Lovatt moved into a specially designed dolphinarium with a young male dolphin called Peter, living there more or less 24 hours a day in an office that overhang his water tank. The idea was that with constant human contact, it would perhaps be possible for a dolphin to fully grasp and imitate human language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem: the pup’s burgeoning sexual needs began to interrupt the language lessons. At first Peter was intermittently relocated to spend time with female dolphins in another tank, but Lovatt found that this interfered too much with her research and the bond she was trying to establish. So she began to satisfy Peter’s needs herself. “It wasn’t sexual on my part. Sensuous perhaps,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/08/the-dolphin-who-loved-me&quot;&gt;she told Christopher Riley&lt;/a&gt;, the producer and director of the BBC documentary &lt;em&gt;The Girl Who Talked To Dolphins&lt;/em&gt;. “It seemed to me that it made the bond closer,” she continued. “Not because of the sexual activity, but because of the lack of having to keep breaking. And that’s really all it was. I was there to get to know Peter. That was part of Peter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just an odd tale, but a sad one. As Lovatt’s experiment was coming to an end, news came that funding was being withdrawn from the lab (Riley says this is because of wider concerns about the welfare of all the resident dolphins). The following year, Dolphin House lab was forced to close. The story goes that after being moved to claustrophobic surroundings in Miami, Peter took his own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex the Parrot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language skills and a keen intelligence are not only the preserve of apes and dolphins, as shown – to many experts’ surprise at the time – by the remarkable achievements of the African Grey parrot Alex (an acronym for “Avian Learning Experiment”), who was studied for 30 years by the psychologist Irene Pepperberg, until the parrot’s death in 2007 at the age of 31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepperberg, who bought Alex from a pet store in 1977, was apparently inspired to study Alex because she’d read about the linguistic achievements of Washoe (see above) and other animals. As well as being famous for his one liners, Alex apparently learned over 100 words, could name over 50 objects and knew his colours and shapes. He starred in several BBC and PBS documentaries. Like many of his ape peers in the research world, Alex also received notable obituaries upon his death. &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; referred to him as science’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/node/9828615&quot;&gt;best known parrot&lt;/a&gt;“. The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; ran with “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/11/science/11parrot.html&quot;&gt;Brainy Parrot Dies, Emotive To The End&lt;/a&gt;“, in reference to the fact that Alex’s last words to Pepperberg the night he died were “You be good, see you tomorrow. I love you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with his ape peers, it seems that Alex contributed to research that is more likely to stand the test of time. He featured in dozens of quality peer-reviewed papers by Pepperberg (by contrast, it’s over 20 years since the on-going Koko project published a significant language paper in a peer-reviewed journal, and that was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.koko.org/scientific-publications&quot;&gt;in the &lt;em&gt;Russian Journal of Foreign Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). In his recent review of human-animal communication, anthropologist Don Kulick wrote the “… emphasis on cognition and downplaying of language seem to have protected Pepperberg’s studies [of Alex] from the sort of critical onslaught that pulverized ape-language research”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Betty the Crow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex is far from being the only smart bird in town. Betty, the New Caledonian crow, though less famous than the parrot, made headlines around the world in 2002 when it was reported that she had shown the ingenuity to make a hook out of a straight piece of wire, to reach food in a plastic tube (another crow had taken off with the hook provided by the researchers). This was considered a big deal because, as one of the researchers &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2178920.stm&quot;&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Although many animals use tools, purposeful modification of objects to solve new problems, without training or prior experience, is virtually unknown”. In fact, the researchers claimed Betty’s tool-making was more impressive than the tool use seen among chimps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as is usually the way with animal research of this kind, doubts have since been raised about the way Betty’s feat was interpreted. Last year, a different team of researchers &lt;a href=&quot;http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/8/160439&quot;&gt;studied 18 New Caledonian crows&lt;/a&gt; as they made tools with the branches they use in the wild. Crucially, the researchers observed that most of the birds performed the same final modification – to create a hook shape – as seen by Betty in the lab. In other words, Betty’s feat was not entirely spontaneous, but probably part of her species’ natural repertoire. Meanwhile, while we’re talking about corvids, an honourable mention should go to psychologist Nicky Clayton’s scrub-jays, who have been observed demonstrating many behaviours previously considered uniquely human, such as advanced deceit. For instance, a jay will re-hide her food stash if a potential thief was nearby when she first hid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaser the Border Collie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to be outdone by the birds and the apes, a dog named &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chaserthebordercollie.com&quot;&gt;Chaser the Border Collie&lt;/a&gt; can reportedly recognise over 1000 words, having been trained extensively through play by the psychologists Alliston Reid and John Pilley. “We have found that play is infinitely greater than food [for training]. It’s not as distracting and dogs don’t satiate on play” says Pilley in a promotional video (see above) for his &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; best-selling book, &lt;em&gt;Chaser: Unlocking the Genius of The God Who Knows a Thousand Words&lt;/em&gt;. Are Chaser’s skills an example of true animal intelligence? Pilley thinks so: “These kind of findings definitely show that lower animals, especially dogs, are not machines with blood. They have emotions, they have mental processes,” says. But again, anyone watching Pilley with his research subject will see the common problem of an emotional bond between scientist and animal, potentially blurring objectivity and making it difficult to interpret research findings. That said, in the formal &lt;a href=&quot;http://webs.wofford.edu/reidak/Pubs/Pilley%20and%20Reid%202011.pdf&quot;&gt;published paper&lt;/a&gt; detailing Chaser’s achievements, Pilley claims to have ruled out the possibility that Chaser relies on visual cues, “Clever Hans style”.  Chaser’s fame continues to grow through regular documentary appearances, including on 60 Minutes and National Geographic and on the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Echo the Elephant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Echo the elephant died in 2009 at the age of 64 having been filmed and observed in Kenya’s Amboseli National Park for several decades, making her the world’s most studied elephant (although, strictly speaking she was the subject of ethological rather than psychological study). Echo, who was her tribe’s matriarch for about 36 years, starred in at least four documentaries, including David Attenborough’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-10867099/echo-an-unforgettable-elephant&quot;&gt;Echo: An Unforgettable Elephant&lt;/a&gt;. The principal researcher was ethologist Cynthia Moss who – like many of the other researchers mentioned in this list, formed a powerful emotional bond with Echo. Moss learned from Echo and the other elephants of Amboseli about their emotional lives, their transmission of cultural practices and their capacity for future planning and teamwork. This is illustrated in the clip above, in which Echo marshals the support of her tribe’s adult females to execute an apparently daring rescue of her daughter, Ebony, who had been kidnapped by a rival tribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harlow’s Monkeys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to cheat again for this last entry and rather than name a specific creature, include a group of animals who helped us better understand a fundamental fact about ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of physical touch between mother and baby is today widely recognised, but back in the 1950s this wasn’t the case, thanks in part to the influence of Freud and his ideas that an infant bonds with her mother primarily because she satisfies her basic needs of thirst and hunger. The American psychologist Harry Harlow’s research in the 1950s with rhesus monkeys changed this. Though ethically controversial, it provided a powerful demonstration of the importance of physical contact in mother-infant attachment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by his observation that monkeys separated from their mothers grew highly attached to and possessive of their blankets, Harlow created two forms of surrogate mother: one made of wire that provided milk, another warm and soft that provided comfort but no milk. Given the choice, infant monkeys spent the majority of their time with the soft, warm version. However, without their mothers, even the monkeys who clinged to the cloth-covered surrogates developed serious behavioural problems later, lending graphic evidence to support the British psychologist John Bowlby’s claims about the importance of early maternal care.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2017-12-20T16:59:17+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Applications are invited for a PhD studentship on Computational frameworks for high-dimensional neural data with &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=NEd35e8AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Dr. Shabnam Kadir&lt;/a&gt; in the Biocomputation Research Group in the Centre for Computer Science and Informatics Research, University of Hertfordshire, U.K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New developments in experimental technology have led to petabytes of raw data being produced by experimental neuroscientists, which are increasingly publicly available, e.g. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.brain-map.org/&quot;&gt;Allen Institute data&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, we are in the realm where population recordings of tens of thousands of neurons are feasible thanks to, e.g. a new generation of large dense probes for electrophysiological recordings, imaging using 2-photon microscopy coupled with calcium fluorescent sensors. Large scale neuronal recordings require novel approaches for both processing and quantitative analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as using techniques from high-dimensional statistics, machine learning, information theory, we aim to explore new approaches from mathematical fields outside statistics, such as algebraic topology. The study of networks is a particularly important topic in neuroscience: neurons communicate with each other electrically via synapses, forming intricate networks. These networks can be studied using techniques from computational topology (e.g. persistent homology, clique topology). These could be used to extract information about subnetworks and assemblies, both from large scale recordings, and via connectomics derived from simulations (Blue Brain Project).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aim in this project to go beyond spike sorting and develop new tools and computational frameworks which would help interpret high dimensional data and interrogate how information is being processed by the brain, e.g.  How are sensory stimuli (location in environment, visual and auditory stimuli) encoded? How can we characterise the neural activity associated with memory, attention, decision making and motor control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shall be collaborating with labs at Imperial College London, Pennsylvania State University, and University College London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information can be found here: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/187455/Dec2017-computational-frameworks-for-high-dimensional-neural-data.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/187455/Dec2017-computational-frameworks-for-high-dimensional-neural-data.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for candidates with the following profile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong first degree in a quantitative field such as mathematics, physics, computer science, engineering, computational neuroscience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong programming skills (e.g. Python, MATLAB, C++).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest in neuroscience and biology would be helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A studentship from the PhD Programme in Computer Science provides approximately £14,550 per annum bursary plus the payment of student fees. Applicants from outside the UK or EU are eligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research in Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire has been recognised as excellent in the latest Research Excellence Framework Assessment, with 50% of the research submitted rated as internationally excellent or world leading. The Centre for Computer Science and Informatics Research  provides a very stimulating environment, offering a large number of specialised and interdisciplinary seminars as well as general training and researcher development opportunities. The University is situated in Hatfield, in the green belt just north of London.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title type="html" xml:lang="en-US">The Neurological Basis of Anxiety</title>
		<link href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/20/neurological-basis-of-anxiety/"/>

		<updated>2017-12-20T16:20:43+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A person suffering from an anxiety disorder experiences neurology-based changes in mood and bodily functions that are discussed in more detail in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with anxiety, various personality traits and emotional responses are by-products of the interaction between our genetic coding and environmental influences. Our genes make us more receptive to some specific stimuli and play a role in developing the resilience to some other stimuli. Our brain is a plastic organ. Thus, the role of environmental factors in its development and casting cannot be negated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear and stress are normal defensive reactions to threats that help our body to deal with challenges more efficiently. Anxiety is different from fear in that it is a set of emotional and somatic reactions to a future threat that &lt;em&gt;may or may not be&lt;/em&gt; realistic. To some extent, having anxiety is a normal human reaction. However,  if it continues for a prolonged period, it may have an adverse effect on our daily life and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the state of anxiety, worrying about the future makes it difficult to concentrate and leads to irritability. Somatic symptoms like palpation, sweating, and gastrointestinal changes are also common in this state. Anxiety is considered as a disorder if such symptoms persist over a period of six or more months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders are most prevalent among people with psychiatric disorders, affecting around 10% of the population at any given time. Nonetheless, only a small number of those suffering from anxiety disorders seek treatment. This can be partially explained by the difficulties in identifying the condition. General anxiety disorder, panic disorder, specific phobias, and social anxiety are some of the most common types of anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What makes a person vulnerable to anxiety disorders?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hereditary nature of various forms of anxiety disorders has been established through clinical and observational studies. Multiple studies have demonstrated that a person is at 3–5 times greater risk of developing anxiety disorders if such a condition is found among first-degree relatives. The importance of familial clustering in anxiety has been demonstrated by a number of twin studies. Other internal factors like certain personality traits also make a person more vulnerable to developing anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from internal factors, environmental factors may also make some people more anxious. These factors include exposure to stressful condition, drug or alcohol use, parenting style, and stressful life events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Neuroanatomy of stress and anxiety&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher cognitive centers in our brain are located in the prefrontal cortex. They are involved in thinking, planning, and social behavior. From an evolutionary perspective, the prefrontal cortex is the “newer” part of the brain that helps us to keep our emotional responses in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the emotion processing takes place in more ancient parts of the cortex. These anatomical brain structures are collectively called the “limbic system”. One fundamental structure in the limbic system is the hippocampus that plays a vital role in the stress response and regulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. Both hippocampal growth and neurogenesis play an essential role in the development of resiliency towards stress and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most crucial part of the limbic system that plays a central role in the regulation of emotions is the amygdala. The amygdala is central to the formation of fear and anxiety-related memory and has been shown to be hyperactive in anxiety disorders. It is well connected with other brain structures like the hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from anatomical changes, it is essential to understand that brain functionality or communication between various brain centers and networks takes place through neurotransmitters. In the case of emotional responses, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is known to have an inhibitory effect on emotions, while glutamate has an excitatory effect. The roles of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine are also well documented in the pathogenesis of various emotional states. Other neurotransmitters that may play a role in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders are cholecystokinin (CCK), galanin (Gal), neuropeptide Y (NPY), oxytocin (OT), vasopressin (AVP), and corticotrophin-releasing factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Neuroanatomical changes in stress&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most anxiety disorder cases develop in childhood, where the long-term and repetitive experience of anxiety leads to changes in specific brain structures that can be observed using neuroimaging. fMRI studies on generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have shown a higher level of activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, a significant level of activity is seen in the amygdala, especially when a person is told to focus on his or her stress, as well changes in the cingular cortex and insular cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During adolescence, there is an acceleration in the physical growth, along with changes in behavior, cognition, and emotional control. The development of the body during this period may result in permanent changes in various brain areas that can be implicated in the development of psychiatric disorders in adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During adolescence, it might be easier to remodel various brain structures with the help of cognitive behavioral therapy or other modalities than in adults. Meanwhile, in adults, various therapeutic agents can be used to alter the biochemical structure of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For patients with anxiety disorders, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are often prescribed as the first line treatment. Other drugs that can be used to treat various anxiety disorders include monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and benzodiazepines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the immense progress in our understanding of neuroanatomy and neuroendocrinology, not all cases of anxiety can currently be treated. However, the latest research on the subject has improved the selection of drugs available for various anxiety disorders. For instance, benzodiazepines are known to be more efficient in the treatment of panic disorders than GAD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As neuroimaging technologies continue to evolve, a better understanding of the neurobiology of anxiety is bound to influence the way we treat anxiety and other related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/12/3101400087_1eb8f11e73_o-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcriptional studies have revealed that alterations of gene expression are key mechanisms by which stimuli induce adaptive modifications in the brain. Indeed, these changes have been associated with the development of behavioral abnormalities.&lt;br /&gt;
Several molecular actors have been shown to be dramatically associated with genetic and behavioral alterations resulting from psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as BDNF, nuclear factor-κB, ΔFosB, tumor necrosis factor-α, and many others. However, the exact neuronal circuits, as well as the involvement of novel molecular cascades relevant to such complex phenomena, remain elusive and deserve in-depth investigations.&lt;br /&gt;
In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0189006&amp;amp;type=printable&quot;&gt;PLOS One article&lt;/a&gt;, Fu and colleagues reported the involvement of TMEM168 (transmembrane protein 168) in the etiology of anxiety and sensorimotor gating deficits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TMEM168, a newly discovered transmembrane protein, has been observed to be increased in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of methamphetamine-treated animals (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13289-0&quot;&gt;Fu et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;). The NAc is a key region of the reward system, which is very sensitive to adaptive changes. Interestingly, the NAc has also been pointed as a master regulator of mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. Taking advantage of viral approaches and behavioral tasks, the group of Atsuma Nitta (University of Toyama, Japan) has found that overexpression of TMEM168 specifically in the NAc was able to promote aberrant behaviors. A series of behavioral tests were performed to detect changes in emotional behavior induced by TMEM168 overexpression. Virus-mediated overexpression of TMEM168 in the NAc did not alter locomotor activity, cognitive ability, social interaction, or depression-like behaviors in mice. Surprisingly, the authors observed increased anxiety in the elevated plus-maze and light/ dark box tasks following TMEM168 overexpression. The basic premise of most of these anxiety-related models is that the set of behavioral responses induced by exposure to a novel (and stressful) environment, which simultaneously evokes fear and curiosity, creates a typical approach-avoidance conflict. In addition, a sensorimotor gating deficit in the auditory prepulse inhibition (PPI) task was detected following TMEM168 overexpression. This test measures pre-attentive processes that operate outside of conscious awareness and is widely used in animal models of diseases marked by an inability to inhibit, or “gate” irrelevant information in sensory, motor, or cognitive domains. “&lt;em&gt;These findings&lt;/em&gt;”, conclude Fu, “&lt;em&gt;suggest that TMEM168 in the NAc is crucial for the modulation of anxiety and schizophrenia-like behaviors in mice&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a neurochemical point of view, the NAc is mainly composed of GABAergic cells and GABA is a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter associated with the regulation of emotional states, including anxiety and panic disorders. Specifically, the reduced concentration of GABA is thought to be associated with increased anxiety levels. Using &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; microdialysis analysis, Fu and colleagues observed that the basal levels of extracellular GABA were reduced in the NAc, and GABA release was also reduced after K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; stimulation in the NAc-TMEM168 mice when compared with their control mice. Furthermore, the pharmacological action of diazepam, a therapeutic molecule known to facilitate GABAergic transmission by binding GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, reversed the TMEM168 overexpression-induced anxiety as measured in both the elevated plus-maze and light/dark box paradigms. “&lt;em&gt;These results suggest that a reduction in GABAergic neurotransmission could be linked to TMEM168-induced anxious behaviors&lt;/em&gt;”, says Kequan Fu, the leading author of the article.&lt;br /&gt;
The direct targets of the accumbal projections, notably the ventral tegmental area and pallidum, are demonstrated to be relevant to anxiety-like symptoms via GABAergic dysfunction. Thus, according to the authors, “&lt;em&gt;the interrupted GABAergic projection from the NAc might underlie the mechanism of the increased anxiety in the NAc-TMEM mice&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a previous study, the same authors found that extracellular osteopontin (OPN) was increased in the NAc-TMEM mice (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13289-0&quot;&gt;Fu et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;). Activation of integrin receptors is usually determined as the downstream signaling pathway of the secreted OPN and mutations of β1- and β3-containing integrins in mice have been associated with anxiety-like disorders (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.138&quot;&gt;Park and Goda, 2016&lt;/a&gt;). “&lt;em&gt;Thus, the TMEM168-OPN-integrin receptor could also be implicated in the mechanisms underpinning TMEM168-mediated effects on behavior&lt;/em&gt;”, conclude the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these exciting results, the downstream signaling pathways of TMEM168 in gating GABAergic activity or behavioral events still remain unclear. In fact, given the profound cellular heterogeneity of the NAc (D1R-MSNs, D2R-MSNs, interneurons, astrocytes, etc), one could wonder which cell type may be responsible for TMEM168-mediated effects. Indeed, future investigations will be necessary to fully explore the role of TMEM168 in accumbal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are the intrusive, often distressing, thoughts. &lt;i&gt;My skin is dirty… I must have left the gas on and my house will burn down… &lt;/i&gt;But why do some obsessive thoughts compel the person to act on them, while others don’t? And how are some people with OCD able to control the compulsion to act – to repeatedly wash their hands, or to go home to check appliances, for example – while others can’t?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2155/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; on OCD, published in &lt;i&gt;Clinical Psychological Psychotherapy&lt;/i&gt;, point out: “A single negative intrusive thought may result in an avalanche of compulsive behaviour, whereas even hours of intrusive thought may prompt little or no compulsive behaviour in some individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32954&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An earlier &lt;a href=&quot;http://%3Chttp://journals.lww.com/jonmd/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2014&amp;amp;issue=07000&amp;amp;article=00008&amp;amp;type=abstract&quot;&gt;internet-based pilot study&lt;/a&gt; of people diagnosed with OCD, by the same team, suggested that if the obsessive thoughts are accompanied by matching illusory sensory perceptions (preoccupation with the idea of one’s house burning down accompanied by the smell of smoke, for example), this makes the experience more intense, and is more likely to lead to compulsive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate more thoroughly, Steffen Moritz at the University of Hamburg, Germany, and his colleagues, recruited 34 people diagnosed with OCD, and who were being treated at Hamburg University’s medical centre. Interviews established the severity of the participants’ obsessive and compulsive symptoms, and they took a battery of tests, including the research team’s own Sensory Properties of Obsessions Questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around three quarters of the patients reported experiencing obsessive thoughts with sensory properties. Obsessions concerning contamination – with having dirt, or perhaps blood, on the skin, for example – were particularly associated with sensory experiences, especially involving vision or touch, such as a perception of a tingling in the fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that the more a patient’s thoughts were accompanied by these sensory experiences, the less control they had over their compulsions. “If [the finding is] replicated, the extent of sensory experiences may explain why some patients act upon obsessional beliefs,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did some patients report sensory experiences during obsessional thoughts, when others didn’t? It’s possible that it stems from an overall more vivid imagination, the researchers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If imagination is shown by future work to be an important factor, then in theory, this might open up new approaches to treatment. Perhaps teaching patients how to use vivid mental imagery to counteract undesirable perceptions might help. However, as the researchers also note, there may a risk that this would also amplify negative images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2155/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;If it is absurd, then why do you do it? The richer the obsessional experience, the more compelling the compulsion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/cigarette-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smoking is one of the most important preventable causes of ill-health and premature death in Scotland. There are around 10,000 smoking related deaths every year and it is responsible for around 128,000 annual hospital admissions. If we are to realize our ambition &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2013/03/3766&quot;&gt;to make Scotland tobacco free by 2034&lt;/a&gt; it is important that tobacco control policies remain a priority. The only way we will know that such policies are successful is to have effective ways of measuring their impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9721&quot; style=&quot;width: 798px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9721 size-full&quot; height=&quot;458&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/image1.png&quot; width=&quot;788&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Smoking prevalence in Scotland and policy actions&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Source: Reid G et al. Review of ‘Creating a tobacco-free generation: A Tobacco Control Strategy for Scotland’. Edinburgh: NHS Health Scotland; 2017. Available from: http://www.healthscotland.scot/publications/review-of-creating-a-tobacco-free-generation-a-tobacco-control-strategy-for-scotland &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is reasonable to conclude that the policies introduced in Scotland over the past 10-15 years have contributed to the decline in smoking prevalence in the country. The problem is that it’s often difficult to show this conclusively. The data used to produce the above chart come from a national self-reported survey, the most common approach to measuring smoking behaviour for decades. These surveys are crucial to our understanding of smoking levels and patterns, how they differ between population subgroups, and how they change over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, such methods are prone to a number of biases which can undermine their accuracy. In addition, self-reported survey data can be limited for evaluation purposes as they are usually based on a relatively small sample of the population and are typically reported on an annual basis. Therefore, to better understand the impact of tobacco control, additional methods for measuring smoking are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales data may offer a more robust and objective approach for estimating population levels of health behaviours. Drawing on our experience of using alcohol sales data for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.healthscotland.scot/health-topics/alcohol/monitoring-and-evaluating-scotlands-alcohol-strategy&quot;&gt;Measuring and Evaluating Scotland’s Alcohol Strategy (MESAS),&lt;/a&gt; we decided to obtain cigarette sales data and use this to estimate population cigarette consumption in Scotland, and the rest of Great Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used data on the number of cigarette sticks sold in Scotland and England/Wales from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nielsen.com/uk/en.html&quot;&gt;Nielsen&lt;/a&gt;. They estimate sales based on cigarette packs scanned at the checkouts of most large retailers across Great Britain and a representative sample of smaller retailers. We looked at the total number of cigarette sticks sold per month between 2008 and 2015 as well as by pack size and retailer type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of interesting findings emerged. We found that trends in population cigarette consumption were similar across Great Britain, declining between 2008 and 2013 but then stabilising. A key factor in the downward trend is likely to be rising cigarette prices. And price is also likely to explain the sharp rise in packs containing between 14-19 cigarette sticks from 2014. In response to increases in cigarette duty, manufacturers of &lt;a href=&quot;http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/early/2017/10/09/tobaccocontrol-2017-053891&quot;&gt;cigarettes started to produce smaller packs to maintain certain price points&lt;/a&gt;. Sales data show a decline in sales of 20-packs and a rise in 14-19 packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_9722&quot; style=&quot;width: 1536px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9722 size-full&quot; height=&quot;996&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/image2.png&quot; width=&quot;1526&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Trends in mean monthly cigarette sales per adult smoker, by pack size, Scotland and England/Wales, 2008-2015&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key finding was that population cigarette consumption was consistently higher in Scotland than in England/Wales. This was due to higher sales of 20-packs in earlier years, but more recently 14-19 packs. The reasons for this are unclear, but it’s not likely to be due to major differences in the retail or policy environments, which are similar. Differences in historical smoking rates, cultural norms and socioeconomic deprivation are more likely explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all data sources, cigarette sales data have their own important limitations. In particular, they are vulnerable to a range of biases that affect their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.healthscotland.com/documents/26537.aspx&quot;&gt;validity and reliability&lt;/a&gt;. For example, they don’t measure consumption of illicit cigarettes, cross-border purchases or duty free shopping. This means that sales data may provide an underestimation of actual levels of cigarette consumption. It is also not possible to use retail sales data to examine cigarette consumption across different population subgroups – for example comparing lower and higher income groups. Therefore this data cannot be used to evaluate the impact of policy on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.healthscotland.scot/health-topics/smoking/prevention&quot;&gt;persistent inequalities in smoking&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also worth noting that the two key results – the trend over time in population cigarette consumption and the higher level of consumption in Scotland – are consistent with self-reported surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This begs the question: what is the unique benefit of these sales data for tobacco control monitoring and evaluation? There are several.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales data are available at frequent time periods, which provides a &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.12701/abstract&quot;&gt;large number of data points for robust policy evaluation&lt;/a&gt;. The breakdowns by pack size are another unique feature and, although not obtained for this study, price information is also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These features of cigarette retail sales data show their potential usefulness for policy monitoring and evaluation in Scotland and the rest of the Great Britain. Indeed, the data are currently being used by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bath.ac.uk/health/research/tobacco-control/&quot;&gt;Tobacco Research Group at the University of Bath&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate the impact of standardized packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is our view that the data should be considered, alongside other sources of data, to evaluate any &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.healthscotland.scot/publications/tobacco-control-strategy-in-scotland-a-qualitative-study&quot;&gt;new tobacco control policies that may emerge in the future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distressing conditions including PTSD, depression and anxiety have something in common: a difficulty in suppressing unwanted thoughts. Negative self-judgments and re-experienced traumas directly impact mental health and make recovery harder by intruding into the new experiences that should provide distance and a mental fresh start. Understanding what’s involved in thought suppression may therefore be one key to helping people with these conditions. Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00956-z&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt; has uncovered an important new brain process that may help explain why some people struggle to control their thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-32947&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, led by Taylor Schmitz, comes from the lab of Michael Anderson at Cambridge’s MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit. Anderson first began investigating thought suppression when the dominant position was that it’s not possible to suppress thoughts voluntarily – “just try to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; think of a white bear for five minutes and see what happens!” was the popular example of the time, derived from Daniel Wegner’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironic_process_theory&quot;&gt;ironic processing theory&lt;/a&gt;. However, Anderson used new methods, including the so-called “Think/No-Think paradigm” (more on this in a moment), to show that suppressed thoughts only rebound under certain conditions – in other words, it is sometimes possible to suppress thoughts successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new research used Anderson’s Think/No-Think paradigm. Participants first studied pairs of words. Afterwards they were shown one word from each pair and – depending on the instruction for that pair – either had to recall the other word in the pair (a “Think” trial), or instead had to block the other word from coming to mind (a “No Think” trial) . Later, when participants tried to remember which words were partnered with which, they did worse for pairs from No-Think trials than Think trials, on average (in fact, they did even worse recalling the No-Think pairs than other pairs that hadn’t featured at all since the initial study phase). This shows that No Think pairings had mostly been suppressed successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These effects replicate established findings for the Think/No Think paradigm. The main purpose of the new study was to see what was happening in the brain during this process, and for this, Schmitz and his colleagues used two imaging techniques: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to look at patterns of blood flow during the task, and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), to look at the concentration of neurotransmitters in different parts of the brain. For comparison, the researchers also scanned the participants’ brains during a task that involves suppressing movements, rather than thoughts (the “Stop Signal” task, in which a key must be pressed as fast as possible in response to certain colour cues, but the button press withheld for other colour cues).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the suppression of thoughts (the No-Think trials), blood flow was reduced in the hippocampus, an area of the brain involved in memory. The extent of this change was related to the levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Participants with a higher concentration of GABA, specifically in the hippocampus, also showed a greater decrease in blood flow in that area. Moreover, the degree of thought suppression correlated with the amount of GABA in the hippocampus (not in the brain more widely). These same patterns were not observed in the Stop Signal task. These findings strongly suggests that hippocampal GABA is playing a specific role in the ability to suppress thoughts, by helping the area to dial-down its activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What triggers the involvement of GABA during No-Think trials? Previous work suggests that the thought suppression process involves a signal starting in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the more this frontal brain area is active, the more deactivated the hippocampus becomes – akin to the control area of the brain telling the hippocampus to cool its jets. The new findings suggest that this “negative coupling”, as it’s known, depends on GABA. For people low in hippocampal GABA, this process – which appears to be a key component of thought suppression – didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new findings have implications for our understanding of mental health conditions, suggesting that lower concentrations of GABA could be a risk factor for some. However, the research is correlational, so this conclusion has to be taken tentatively (causality could be the other way around, such that GABA is driven pathologically low by psychological issues). Bear in mind too that the sample were all mentally well participants. Future research could test the causal role of hippocampal GABA in uncontrolled thoughts (including in clinical samples), as well as refine our understanding of which psychological interventions will be of benefit – most likely those that don’t just harness the involvement of frontal brain areas, but also produce downstream change in the soil health of the hippocampal range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study represents a breakthrough in bridging neurophysiology and psychology, and it looks likely that getting a grip on the role of molecular pathways in the hippocampus will be at least part of the solution to help those for whom issues from the past still plague their present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00956-z&quot;&gt;Hippocampal GABA enables inhibitory control over unwanted thoughts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/12/Fotolia_49249610_Subscription_Yearly_XXL-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social isolation isn’t just loneliness — it may also affect your health. For instance, social relationships may have an impact on the development of chronic diseases, like type 2 diabetes. A clear picture on how social network characteristics may influence type 2 diabetes could contribute to the prevention of type 2 diabetes, as well as to the improvement of interventions for people who already have the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our study, we addressed whether social network size, contact frequency, type of relationship (family, friends, acquaintances), living alone and social participation, were associated with several stages of type 2 diabetes: pre-diabetes, newly diagnosed and previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes. In addition, we investigated whether more quality related characteristics of the social network, like emotional or practical support, were associated with pre-diabetes, newly diagnosed, and previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In diabetes women, network members lived closer and were more often family than friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, we asked nearly 3000 participants of The Maastricht Study to fill out a questionnaire on their social networks. For example, we asked them to indicate whom they turned to with problems or whom they go out with. Participants in The Maastricht Study are men and women, aged 40 to 75 years, and live in the southern part of the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network size in individuals with type 2 diabetes appeared to be smaller, women with type 2 diabetes typically had 8 network members compared to 12 in those without diabetes, in men this was 7 in type 2 diabetes compared to 10 in those without diabetes. These results indicate that socially isolated individuals more often have type 2 diabetes. In diabetes women, network members lived closer and were more often family than friends. Apparently, a more centralized social network is associated with type 2 diabetes in women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting social networks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these results in mind, we believe that targeting the social network may prove a promising prevention strategy for type 2 diabetes. Socially isolated individuals could be encouraged to improve their lifestyle, for instance lose weight and become more physically active, in a setting that increases their social integration. Such interventions should enable extension and broadening of the social network, by supporting them to make new friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men and women who perceived less social support, and were less involved in social activities, more often had type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, men and women who perceived less social support, and were less involved in social activities, more often had type 2 diabetes. In particular, as men living alone seem to be at a higher risk for the development of type 2 diabetes, they should become recognized as high-risk group in health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, new lifestyle interventions should be combined with stimulating participants to become member of a club (e.g. volunteer organization, sports club, discussion group), as we have shown that a lack of participation in social activities was associated with pre-diabetes and previously diagnosed T2DM. Thus, social network size and social participation may be used as a risk indicator in diabetes prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our study, we endeavor that negative health effects of social isolation and poor social networks become widely recognized. Notably, targeting social network characteristics may also have benefits for other public health concepts, as it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/development-of-prediction-models-for-upper-and-lower-respiratory-and-gastrointestinal-tract-infections-using-social-network-parameters-in-middleaged-and-older-persons-the-maastricht-study/0381B153773C4755B7CF25F969BAA9C1&quot;&gt;has been shown&lt;/a&gt; that social networks were also strong predictors for infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the mechanisms underlying the associations of social network characteristics with the development of type 2 diabetes are not yet elucidated, our findings are of great importance to the field of diabetes prevention. Our results implicate that strengthening of the social network can be used to optimize non-medical prevention strategies for type 2 diabetes. Our findings support the idea that solving social isolation may prevent the development of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
