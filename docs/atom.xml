&lt;p&gt;The idea that some of us experience “&lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-5/feeling-fraud&quot;&gt;imposter syndrome&lt;/a&gt;” was first mooted in the 1970s by two US clinical psychologists who noticed the preponderance of high-achieving women who felt they had somehow cheated or fluked their way to success and feared being found out. Research on the syndrome has since exploded and it’s become clear that many men also experience similar fraudulent feelings. In fact, in their new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886918302435&quot;&gt;exploratory paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/em&gt;, a team of US and German researchers claim that, under pressure, imposter syndrome may hit men harder than women, triggering more anxiety and worse performance – a difference they speculate may be due to traditional gender norms that place a greater expectation on men to be competent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34000&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Badawy and her colleagues recruited hundreds of female and male undergrads studying communication or business in northeastern USA. They measured their levels of imposter syndrome with an established scale that includes items like “Sometimes I’m afraid others will discover how much knowledge or ability I really lack”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one study, the researchers gave the students two sets of five verbal and numerical Graduate Record Exam questions (the GRE is used in the US to select students for graduate programmes). After the first set of questions, the researchers ramped up the pressure for half the students, giving them fake feedback that stated they had answered all of the first five questions incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although imposter feelings were overall higher among women, this harsh feedback seemed to especially affect male students with high imposter feelings – they reported higher anxiety, made less effort (as measured by time taken on the task), and showed a trend towards poorer performance, as compared to others given positive feedback. In contrast, female students with high imposter feelings responded to harsh feedback by increasing their effort and showing superior performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was similar in a second study in which heightened pressure was placed on half the students by telling them that their results on five Graduate Record Exam questions would be shown to a professor on their course (the researchers called this a “high accountability” situation). In this context, men with higher imposter syndrome scores again showed increased anxiety, reduced effort and a tendency toward worse performance, as compared with others who were told their scores would be shown anonymously to a stranger. In contrast, women with imposter feelings were largely unaffected (in terms of anxiety, effort or performance) by the increased accountability situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase in anxiety, and reduction in effort, shown by men with imposter feelings could be interpreted as reflecting their fear of being found out, combined with a “self-handicapping” strategy – reducing their effort so that they can use this as an excuse to explain the poor performance that they are anticipating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Assuming that traditional gender norms hold, males [with imposter syndrome] may have exhibited  stronger negative reactions because they believe that society at large values males who demonstrate high competence and at the same time, do not believe that they can fulfil this standard,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the women with imposter feelings appeared less sensitive to the negative feedback and expectation of review by a professor – if anything, they arguably responded to negative feedback in an adaptive way by increasing their effort. The researchers linked this with the traditional cultural expectation that women should be warm rather than competent.  “Being less constrained by gender norm violations and backlash (i.e. they were already expected to perform poorly on competence-based tasks like exam questions), females [with imposter feelings] may have felt freer to attempt to improve their performance (and risk failure) rather than excusing it with lack of time or effort invested,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to know if and how these findings might relate to real-world situations in an  academic setting or workplace. Badawy and her team admit their findings are exploratory and may not generalise. In particular, if their explanation based around gender norms is accurate, one can imagine these norms might vary not just across international cultures, but even between different sub-cultures in the same country – depending, for instance, on the specific gender-based attitudes, beliefs and pressures in different occupations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These issues aside, Badawy and her colleagues suggest their key finding – of particular male vulnerability to imposter syndrome under pressure – may have practical implications for managers. “If managers of organisational specialists observe evidence of imposter syndrome in male workers currently performing at high levels, they may benefit from making attempts to restore those workers’ sense of agency if they are placed under high accountability situations,” they said. They added that mentoring by professors or managers, skills training and stretch assignments could be potential beneficial strategies (find &lt;a href=&quot;https://99u.adobe.com/articles/54774/how-to-beat-the-imposter-syndrome-feeling&quot;&gt;more ways to combat imposter syndrome in this 99U article&lt;/a&gt;). However, they warned these will only work “if mentors are trained to down regulate their own gender role expectations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886918302435&quot;&gt;Are all impostors created equal? Exploring gender differences in the impostor phenomenon-performance link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average young adult sends more than 100 texts per day, mainly to offer social support to friends and family. But until now, there has been little evidence whether it helps the recipient or not. New &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563218300918&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Computers in Human Behavior&lt;/i&gt; confirms that sending a comforting text to a partner confronted with a difficult task really can make them feel supported. But more surprisingly, the study suggests that to actually reduce their stress, it’s better to send a message that isn’t explicitly supportive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-34002&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Hooker and colleagues from the University of California asked 75 women to attempt a stressful set of tasks involving mental mathematics and public speaking. At the start of the experiment they were fitted with a blood pressure cuff to capture information about blood flow and heart rate. While waiting to perform, some participants received texts from their romantic partner who was waiting in the other room. Crucially, some of the partners sent texts (scripted by the researchers) that were comforting (e.g. “Don’t worry. It’s just a psych study. You’ll be fine.”) whereas others sent more mundane texts that were not explicitly supportive (e.g. “It’s cold in here.”). Participants also received a second reinforcing text with the same tone as the first (i.e. either supportive or mundane) while they prepared for their challenge (other participants acted as a baseline control group and received no texts at any point).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After delivering the task, participants who’d earlier received a comforting text reported feeling more supported by their partner (compared with the controls). However, it was only those participants who’d earlier received mundane texts who showed a physical reduction in their stress response, as shown by lower systolic blood pressure during preparation and the task itself.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that attempts to support other people that give the impression of social evaluation – “I can see that you’re struggling” – are ineffective at reducing stress, and Hooker’s team conjecture that the supportive texts, by making direct references to the stressful tasks, may have inadvertently triggered this effect, although this was not explicitly tested for in the study. If so, it adds to research suggesting that “invisible” support – like offering unrelated humour – can be one of the more effective forms of reducing stress through social support. In this case, simply the reminder that the boyfriend was next door, grumbling about the cold, affirmed that the person was not alone, and could receive comfort or validation should that be needed (e.g. if the stressful event went badly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding certainly needs follow-up research to figure out what are the ingredients in different forms of text-based social contact to affect how we feel. It’s worth noting that the effect of the mundane messages also involved a slower recovery to blood pressure baseline than the supportive text or the control condition. So it may be that different kinds of messages can have selective effects on different phases of the stress response. Studies have begun to show downsides of heavy texting use, such as school performance and sleep, although in many cases these may be confounded by use of mobile phones in general. It’s useful, then, to see evidence of something many of us assume and hope for – that contact with loved ones via text can provide them with a sense of being supported during stressful events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563218300918&quot;&gt;It just takes a text: Partner text messages can reduce cardiovascular responses to stress in females&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/05/Ebola_Blogs_690x320-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early sharing and expedited peer review of relevant research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the ongoing Ebola &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/ebola/en/&quot;&gt;outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; we are creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/ebola&quot;&gt;PLOS Channel for Ebola Research&lt;/a&gt;.  The Channel will make it easy for researchers to keep up with developments and important research related to the outbreak. We will work with authors and our editorial boards to provide rapid review and facilitate the responsible dissemination of preprints. We believe these responses are urgently needed during serious and rapidly developing threats to public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All relevant articles published across PLOS will be included in the Ebola Channel, alongside major contributions curated from the broader literature. You can also send any questions or content recommendations to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:ebola@plos.org&quot;&gt;ebola@plos.org&lt;/a&gt; or tweet us @PLOSChannels using the hashtag #PLOSEbola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I make my Ebola research available quickly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve created a taskforce to identify editors and reviewers, and to manage an expedited review process across all our journals and platforms.  For authors, we recommend the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to share a single observation (no more than 1 figure or table with commentary) submit to PLOS Currents: Outbreaks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Submit any other research to one of the 7 PLOS journals; all Ebola-related submissions will be prioritized. (Note that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/fee-assistance#loc-fee-assistance-programs&quot;&gt;fee waiver assistance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; is available as needed)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share your data and manuscript ahead of submission: large datasets should be deposited in a relevant repository, and manuscripts submitted to a preprint server. Include the DOIs or accession numbers for datasets and preprint in your submission. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to expediting research publications, PLOS believes all data on the Ebola outbreak should be shared as rapidly and openly as possible. We endorse the Wellcome Trust’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/our-work/sharing-research-findings-and-data-relevant-ebola-outbreak-drc&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/a&gt;demanding availability of data and research on Ebola. Editorial consideration of research submissions to PLOS journals will not be prejudiced by the early sharing of data or preprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons learned: delivering rapid responses to emergency outbreaks &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS saw surges in submissions in previous outbreaks, notably the Ebola outbreak of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2014/09/05/plos-resources-ebola/&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt; and the Zika outbreak of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2016/01/07/will-zika-become-the-2016-ntd-of-the-year/&quot;&gt;2015/2016&lt;/a&gt;. In each emergency, we provided resources to serve the community. In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/data-sharing-make-outbreak-research-open-access-1.16966&quot;&gt;concerns&lt;/a&gt; about data sharing during the 2014 Ebola outbreak led PLOS and other journal editors to issue a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/medicines/ebola-treatment/blueprint_phe_data-share-results/en/&quot;&gt;joint statement&lt;/a&gt; encouraging early data sharing. A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002549&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt; showed that, while increased use of preprints in the 2016 Zika outbreak accelerated the dissemination of research results, the proportion of published articles on Zika that were preceded by preprints remained low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our shared responsibility in public health emergencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe research, healthcare, and publishing communities have a responsibility to work together to respond rapidly to public health emergencies. PLOS is committed to disseminating new research findings as efficiently and effectively as possible. We appreciate the opportunity to facilitate access to your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Applications are invited for a PhD studentship on Computational frameworks for
high-dimensional neural data with Dr. Shabnam Kadir in the Biocomputation
Research Group in the Centre for Computer Science and Informatics Research,
University of Hertfordshire, U.K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New developments in experimental technology have led to petabytes of raw data
being produced by experimental neuroscientists, which are increasingly publicly
available, e.g. Allen Institute data (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.brain-map.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.brain-map.org/&lt;/a&gt;). In particular,
we are in the realm where population recordings of tens of thousands of neurons
are feasible thanks to, e.g. a new generation of large dense probes for
electrophysiological recordings, imaging using 2-photon microscopy coupled with
calcium fluorescent sensors. Large scale neuronal recordings require novel
approaches for both processing and quantitative analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as using techniques from high-dimensional statistics, machine learning,
information theory, we aim to explore new approaches from mathematical fields
outside statistics, such as algebraic topology. The study of networks is a
particularly important topic in neuroscience: neurons communicate with each
other electrically via synapses, forming intricate networks. These networks can
be studied using techniques from computational topology (e.g. persistent
homology, clique topology). These could be used to extract information about
subnetworks and assemblies, both from large scale recordings, and via
connectomics derived from simulations (Blue Brain Project).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aim in this project to go beyond spike sorting and develop new tools and
computational frameworks which would help interpret high dimensional data and
interrogate how information is being processed by the brain, e.g.  How are
sensory stimuli (location in environment, visual and auditory stimuli) encoded?
How can we characterise the neural activity associated with memory, attention,
decision making and motor control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shall be collaborating with labs at Imperial, Pennsylvania State University
and UCL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information can be found here:

&lt;p&gt;We are looking for candidates with the following profile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong first degree in a quantitative field such as mathematics, physics,
computer science, engineering, computational neuroscience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong programming skills (e.g. Python, MATLAB, C++).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest in neuroscience and biology would be helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A studentship from the PhD Programme in Computer Science provides approximately
£14,750 per annum bursary plus the payment of student fees. Applicants from
outside the UK or EU are eligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research in Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire has been
recognised as excellent in the latest Research Excellence Framework Assessment

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/31/taking-a-photo-of-something-impairs-your-memory-of-it-but-the-reasons-remain-largely-mysterious/"/>

		<updated>2018-05-31T10:10:29+00:00</updated>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avid photographers celebrate the viewfinder as a means of helping us see the world anew. But psychology research has shown that under some conditions taking a photo of something actually makes it harder to remember. One possible reason is that we give less attention to an experience when we know that it will be safely stored in a photograph. But in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211368117301687&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition&lt;/i&gt;, Julia Soares and Benjamin Storm from the University of California show that the photo-taker’s memory will suffer whether they expect to keep the photo or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33997&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work aimed to replicate and extend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24311477&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; by Linda Henkel that showed that taking photos of paintings in a museum could lead to poorer recall of those paintings. To make sense of this, Henkel drew on the body of research on&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/29/remembering-together-how-long-term-couples-develop-interconnected-memory-systems/&quot;&gt; transactive memory&lt;/a&gt;, which shows that longtime partners or friends distribute memory demands between them, creating a “shared” system where one will remember certain things so the other doesn’t need to. Henkel thought that in a similar fashion we may be treating the camera as a memory partner and offloading the effort onto it. Soares and Storm tested this explanation by separating photo taking from photo having.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main experiment was a computerised version of Henkel’s museum task. Around 50 undergraduates viewed paintings one at a time onscreen. In one block, participants took a photo of each painting with a smartphone, and then had 15 seconds to look at the painting itself. In a second experimental block, the participants took a photo of each painting, deleted the photo immediately (so they knew it could never been accessed in the future), then had 15 seconds to look at the painting. Finally, in another experimental block, they took no photos and simply viewed each painting for 15 seconds.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a ten minute delay (during which phones were confiscated) came a multiple- choice memory test probing what the participants remembered about the various paintings. Compared to paintings that were simply viewed, performance was poorer for paintings that were photographed. Critically, this was true both for the condition where the photo was stored, and for the condition where it was deleted, meaning the participant knew they could not rely on it as a future memory partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that offloading may not be the cause of the memory disadvantage associated with taking photos. One alternative explanation is that using a camera forces us to disengage from properly taking in the stimulus, as our attention flows to the mechanics of operating buttons, checking brightness, exposure etc. This is something commonly reported by people as part of their photo-taking experience, and also tallies with the fact that automatic wearable cameras that store images for later don’t produce the memory impairment. However, in the current experiment, after taking pictures (or not), every participant had the same amount of time to take in the paintings without use of equipment, so any distraction effect would need to include some sort of delayed effect on memory processing even after the act of taking a photo was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soares and Storm have a speculative second interpretation. They suggest that the effort involved in taking a photo – getting the framing right, ensuring the lens is in focus – leads to the sense that you’ve done a good job of encoding the object itself, even though you have been focusing more on peripheral features. So you’re not mentally slacking-off because you think the camera has it covered – but because you think you already have. It may be relevant that people who take photographs at events &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/25/taking-photos-will-boost-your-enjoyment-of-experiences-researchers-say/&quot;&gt;report afterwards&lt;/a&gt; feeling more immersed in the experience, which would tally more with this explanation than the disengagement-due-to-fiddling idea. In any case this is further evidence that those of us who approach exciting life events through the lenses of our electronic devices may be distancing ourselves from fuller participation.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Estimating the distance of a gas source is important in many applications of chemical sensing, like e.g. environmental monitoring, or chemically-guided robot navigation. If an estimation of the gas concentration at the source is available, source proximity can be estimated from the time-averaged gas concentration at the sensing site. However, in turbulent environments, where fast concentration fluctuations dominate, comparably long measurements are required to obtain a reliable estimate. A lesser known feature that correlates with source proximity in a turbulent environment is the temporal variance of local gas concentration: Gas encounters become more intermittent farther from the source. However, is has commonly been assumed that exploiting this feature requires gas concentration measurements at the millisecond scale, usually requiring expensive photo-ionisation detectors. We have recently shown that, with appropriate signal processing, off-the-shelf metal-oxide sensors are capable of extracting rapidly fluctuating features of gas plumes that strongly correlate with source distance [1]. We present a straightforward analysis method to decode events of large, consistent changes in the measured signal, which we denote ‘bouts’. The frequency of these bouts predicted the distance of a gas source in wind-tunnel experiments with good accuracy. In addition, we found that the variance of bout counts indicates cross-wind offset to the centre- line of the gas plume. Our results offer an alternative approach to estimating gas source proximity that is largely independent of gas concentration, using off-the-shelf metal-oxide sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know someone who is convinced their opinion is better than everyone else’s on a topic – perhaps, even, that it is the only correct opinion to have. Maybe, on some topics, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; are that person. No psychologist would be surprised that people who are convinced their beliefs are superior think they are better informed than others, but this fact leads to a follow on question: are people &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; better informed on the topics for which they are convinced their opinion is superior? This is what Michael Hall and Kaitlin Raimi set out to check in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311730714X&quot;&gt;a series of experiments&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33991&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers distinguish “belief superiority” from “belief confidence” (thinking your opinion is correct). Belief superiority is relative – it is when you think your opinion is more correct than other people’s; the top end of their belief superiority scale is to indicate that your belief is “Totally correct (mine is the only correct view)”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair set out to find people who felt their beliefs on a variety of controversial political issues (things like terrorism and civil liberties, or wealth redistribution) were superior, and to check – using multiple choice quizzes – how well they were informed on the topics about which they held these superiority beliefs.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across five studies Hall and Raimi found that those people with the highest belief superiority also tended to have the largest gap between their perceived and actual knowledge – the belief superior consistently suffered from the illusion that they were better informed than they were. As you might expect, those with the lowest belief superiority tended to underestimate how much they knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as simple background knowledge, the researchers were also interested in how people with belief superiority sought out new information relevant to that belief. They gave participants a selection of news headlines and asked them to select which articles they’d like to read in full at the end of the experiment. Categorising headlines as belief-congruent or belief incongruent, the researchers observed that those participants with higher belief-superiority were more likely to select belief congruent headlines. In other words, despite being badly informed compared to their self-perception, these participants chose to neglect sources of information that would enhance their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally and more promisingly, the researchers found some evidence that belief superiority can be dented by feedback. If participants were told that people with beliefs like theirs tended to score poorly on topic knowledge, or if they were directly told that their score on the topic knowledge quiz was low, this not only reduced their belief superiority, it also caused them to seek out the kind of challenging information they had previously neglected in the headlines task (though the evidence for this behavioural effect was mixed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies all involved participants accessed via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, allowing the researchers to work with large samples of Americans for each experiment. Their findings mirror the well-known &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect&quot;&gt;Dunning-Kruger effect&lt;/a&gt; – Kruger and Dunning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10626367%20&quot;&gt;showed that&lt;/a&gt; for domains such as judgements of grammar, humour or logic, the most skilled tend to underestimate their ability, while the least skilled overestimate it. Hall and Raimi’s research extends this to the realm of political opinions (where objective assessment of correctness is not available), showing that the belief your opinion is better than other people’s tends to be associated with overestimation of your relevant knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the research presents a mixed picture. It shows, as others have, that our opinions are often not as justified as we believe – even for the opinions that we are most confident are better than other people’s. On the other hand, it shows that people are responsive to feedback, and aren’t solely driven by confirmation bias when they seek out new information. The final picture is of human rationality that is flawed, but correctable, not doomed.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311730714X&quot;&gt;Is belief superiority justified by superior knowledge?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/05/30/how-self-compassion-can-fight-perfectionism/"/>
		<id>http://brainblogger.com/?p=23700</id>
		<updated>2018-05-30T15:00:03+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;“Be kind to one another.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to be a die-hard Ellen DeGeneres fan to appreciate the value of that motto. And while we’re reminded how kindness goes a long way in our everyday interactions with others, we often forget to apply it to those who need it most: ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s setting a personal weight-loss goal, or believing that we can ace a final exam—all of us are familiar with the experience of setting high standards. We’re even more familiar with the inevitable let-down that comes from not living up to those very standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter, the life of a perfectionist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, importantly, not all perfectionists operate the same. There are different types that are associated with different psychological outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, if you strive to attain your ambitious goals and prevent yourself from being overly self-critical, you might be a  personal strivings perfectionist. This isn’t so bad. In fact, this type of perfectionism is more likely to lead to relatively higher levels of self-esteem and decreased levels of negative affect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you constantly believe that you are not good enough, if you judge yourself by your shortcomings, and if you are constantly &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/27/social-media-anxiety-disorders-whats-going-on-in-the-brain/&quot;&gt;worried that other people won’t approve of you&lt;/a&gt;, then you might be more on the side of maladaptive perfectionism. This form of perfectionism has been linked to depressive symptoms in both adolescents and adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no wonder then that researchers are curious to know more about interventions that help buffer against this maladaptive perfectionism. In one  recent study, researchers examined the possibility that self-compassion can protect us against the negative effects of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/05/19/when-perfectionism-leads-to-an-imperfect-appearance/&quot;&gt;maladaptive perfectionism&lt;/a&gt;. The questions is, can self-directed kindness increase our chances of living a full, healthy life? Can it combat the symptoms of depression that come from this less ideal version of perfectionism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding self-compassion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may ask, “What exactly is self-compassion? And is it something that can be cultivated by anyone, or is a skill that is only available to some of us?” To shed some light on these questions, researchers have broken down self-compassion into three main components: self-kindness, common humanity, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/21/mindfulness-may-be-the-secret-to-staying-healthy/&quot;&gt;mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the first component is self-explanatory, the other two require careful consideration. When something terrible happens to us, often the initial reaction is to sit and wallow in our grief and self-pity. We convince ourselves that no one else is going through similar problems in their lives. But that is simply not true. Statistically speaking, it’s an erroneous judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be more accepting of ourselves, we need to realize that we are never as alone and isolated as we think we are. This is at the heart of common humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, many of us are prone to &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2018/03/26/different-coping-styles-may-cause-prevent-or-treat-ocd/&quot;&gt;over-analyzing painful experiences&lt;/a&gt;, or trying to avoid negative feelings altogether. Mindfulness then, is about acknowledging our thoughts, feelings, and emotions without judgement, and accepting them as part of the common human experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to our study. Taking into account these three sub-components, the researchers in the present investigation set out to predict that self-compassion would weaken the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/24/9-personality-traits-putting-mothers-at-risk-of-postpartum-depression/&quot;&gt;relationship between perfectionism and depression &lt;/a&gt;in both adolescent and adult populations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;541 adolescents from grades 7 to 10 were recruited for the first study. Participants were asked to complete three online questionnaires during school hours, as part of a larger well-being intervention study. The questionnaires tapped into perfectionism, mood/feelings, self-worth and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/01/25/boost-confidence-with-brain-training/&quot;&gt;self-esteem&lt;/a&gt;, as well as reported self-compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As predicted, self-compassion was found to moderate, or weaken, the relationship between maladaptive perfectionism and depression in this sample of adolescents. Next, the researchers wanted to see if the results would hold for adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;515 adults from the general population were recruited through online advertisements. Again, participants were asked to complete the same questionnaires. Once again in line with the researchers’ predictions, self-compassion was found to weaken the relationship between perfectionism and depression in the adult sample. What was true for teens was also true for adults later on in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that more than anything, today’s culture values perfection. Parents and teachers may push us towards &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/13/how-does-starting-school-early-impact-educational-attainment/&quot;&gt;excellence at school&lt;/a&gt;, our friends may judge us by how we dress and act in their company, and perhaps worst of all, our social media accounts constantly fool us into thinking that there are people out there who actually have perfect lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news, bad news. The bad news is that we can’t completely eradicate perfectionistic thoughts. Good news is that we can try to change our relationship to those thoughts through self-compassion. If we learn to cultivate self-kindness, connection, and mindfulness as we strive toward achieving our goals, any setback we face along the way will be met with greater resilience and mental strength. As a result, we are less likely to fall victim to the debilitating effects of depression, and more likely to live a happy, balanced life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as Ellen DeGeneres reminds us, always be kind to others. But before you do, be sure to look after yourself first. In this case, it’s okay to be a little selfish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;NeuroMat, the largest institutional contributor on Mathematics on Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 15px;&quot;&gt;The Research, Innovation and Dissemination Center for Neuromathematics (RIDC NeuroMat), funded by FAPESP, has chosen web, collaborative platforms as its main line of action in terms of science dissemination. This decision was made in 2014 and now the RIDC has become a relevant institutional contributor to Wikimedia projects and the largest institutional contributor on Mathematics on Wikipedia, according to reports from the Outreach Dashboard, that monitors institutional programs and activities on Wikimedia projects.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scent plays an often &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00778/full&quot;&gt;under-appreciated&lt;/a&gt; role in sexual attraction, helping to account for why visual attractiveness alone can’t explain just how physically attractive a person is perceived to be. But what role does our ability to smell our partners – or potential partners – play in actual experience?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know from past research that men born without the ability to smell tend to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/04/04/investigating-the-love-lives-of-the-men-and-women-who-have-no-sense-of-smell/&quot;&gt;have fewer sexual partners&lt;/a&gt;. And about half of people who lose their sense of smell, through infection or injury, report negative impacts on their sexual behaviour. However, this could be an indirect effect – an inability to smell is often also associated with depression or social insecurity, which can affect aspects of sexuality – and such studies do not tell us whether sense of smell is related to sexual experience among healthy people. Now, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-018-1203-x&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Archives of Sexual Behavior&lt;/i&gt;, Johanna Bendas at the Technical University of Dresden, Germany, and her fellow researchers report evidence from healthy, young adults showing precisely that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33985&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers studied 42 women and 28 men aged between 18 and 36. They found that there was no relationship between their odour sensitivity (measured using a test that establishes how much of a smelly chemical must be present for the individual to be able to detect it) and either sexual desire or sexual performance (defined as how many times they’d engaged in sexual activity during the previous month and how long, on average, a sexual encounter had lasted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, people with a keener sense of smell reported finding their sexual activities more “pleasant”, and women with a greater sensitivity to odours had more orgasms during sex.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our data suggest a positive influence of olfactory sensitivity on the sex life of young and healthy participants,” the researchers write. “The perception of body odors such as vaginal fluids, sperm and sweat seems to enrich the sexual experience” by increasing sexual arousal, they add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations to the study, including the correlational design which means other unknown factors might be playing a causal role. Also, while the researchers did control for the use of hormonal contraception in the women, they didn’t consider the stage of menstrual cycle of the female volunteers at the time of the study – something that is known to influence olfaction. Future research in this area should take this into account, and could further explore the influence of specific odours. “The direct measurement of sexual arousal or experience will give further insight into the assumption that olfactory sensitivity improves sexual experience,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For various reasons, children in many countries are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27848745&quot;&gt;increasingly sedentary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/news/2017/10October/Pages/Childhood-obesity-soars-worldwide.aspx&quot;&gt;childhood obesity is a growing concern&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, research tells us that physical activity is good for children’s minds and bodies, and that if they develop active habits in their youth, they tend to keep them up into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would surely help if children were more active at school, but with growing academic pressures, teachers will tell you that it is difficult to justify sacrificing vital maths and English lessons for more PE classes or games. A possible solution: make academic lessons more physically active. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1090198118762106&quot;&gt;new trial&lt;/a&gt; of a 6-week intervention comprising 18 ten-minute active maths and English lessons, published in &lt;em&gt;Health Education and Behavior&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that such an approach has great potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33977&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma Norris at UCL and her colleagues recruited hundreds of pupils aged 8-9 from 10 London schools. Half were allocated randomly to the active lesson intervention. While they were doing those special classes, the other half of the children acted as a comparison and completed typically taught 10-minute maths and English classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children enrolled in the intervention followed the “virtual traveller” protocol, which involved them performing physical exercises, such as running on the spot, while they travelled the world answering math or English quiz questions pertaining to different countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual travel from country to country was depicted via Google Earth videos and other materials embedded in the teacher’s interactive white board presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further physical activity came from the exercises the children performed to signal whether a given math or English quiz answer was true or false – such as jumping jacks for “true” or performing a football kick for “false”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norris and her team had the children wear motion trackers during the classes and also outside of class for two school days per week and two weekend days (these measures were taken at baseline, during the six-week period, and for a few months beyond). Trained observers also monitored the children’s on-task behaviour in class, and the kids completed questionnaires about their engagement levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the trial was a win-win: the children in the active intervention were more active (based on more light and moderately vigorous activity) during their “virtual traveller” lessons as compared with the control group kids, and what’s more, they also displayed more on-task behavior, in terms of staying more focused on the lesson, following instructions and making more eye contact with their teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very promising but perhaps not quite as good as might have been hoped. The children in the active intervention were mostly no more active than the control kids when averaged across entire school days, nor at the weekends, and this was this case both during and beyond the end of the study. That is, they were more active in the specially designed active lessons (it would have been odd if they weren’t), but mostly this didn’t boost their activity levels enough to make any difference when averaging across the whole day (and didn’t spill over into their habits at the weekend).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lack of a broader benefit could be because the activities in the “virtual traveller” class were not intense enough; the classes were too short and/or infrequent; or perhaps the children compensated for all their in-class exertion by relaxing more later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another disappointment is that the physically active lessons did not boost the pupils’ self-reported engagement levels. On the other hand, and interpreting this result more positively, the extra physical activity did not harm their engagement either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to follow this line of research and see whether longer and/more intense physically active lesson programmes could have bigger benefits for pupils’ lifestyles and whether active lessons might also have an impact on children’s educational performance in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1090198118762106&quot;&gt;Physically Active Lessons Improve Lesson Activity and On-Task Behavior:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #338dc8;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/gursatya/&quot;&gt;Guru Singh&lt;/a&gt;, Director of Scientific Content of Science Exchange, recently spoke with a member of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/quick-biology-inc&quot;&gt;Quick Biology&lt;/a&gt;. Follow the interview below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Give us a quick overview of your company. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Quick Biology Inc. is a genomics startup in Pasadena, CA. We focus on developing new technologies provided to researchers, scientists, and physicians so that they may gain insightful and expedited results from their work. We offer a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) service as well as related reagents to investigate the functions of identified variants. We also help physicians to unlock the potential of NGS in disease diagnosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What accomplishments make Quick Biology Inc. stand out amongst its competitors? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are one of the first sequencing providers to offer an optimized ATAC-seq service for many cell types, and it provides genome-wide profiles of open and accessible regions of chromatin that are indicative of active regulatory regions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do you define the ATAC-seq technique?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;ATAC-seq is a sensitive technique used to rapidly assess genome-wide chromatin accessibility with fewer than 100,000 cells. When it is combined with NGS technology, we can obtain accurate results on chromatin accessibility at single-nucleotide resolution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does ATAC-seq stack up compared to traditional methods?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;There are three major advantages of ATAC-seq over existing methods. After library preparation, the DNA is sequenced with NGS technology. As a result, we can obtain accurate results on chromatin accessibility at single-nucleotide resolution. ATAC-seq requires no sonication or phenol-chloroform extraction like FAIRE-seq, no antibodies like ChIP-seq and no sensitive enzymatic digestion like MNase-seq or DNase-seq. Unlike similar methods, which can take up to four days to complete, ATAC-seq preparation can be completed in under three hours so we can provide a quicker turnaround time for our clients. Another clear advantage is the low biological sample requirements. To illustrate, only 50,000 cells are sufficient for ATAC-seq, as opposed to other methods like ChIP-seq, MNase-seq, or DNase-seq that require at least 1,000-fold more material.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us about your client base and where are they based.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Since our NGS service launched back in January 2016, we have served many clients from universities, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies with NGS projects (RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, WGS, and WES, etc.) from all over the world. Some of our major clients include Boston Biomedical, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NIH, VA medical center, Harvard University, Stanford University, USC, and UCLA, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you tell our readers what makes your company competitive in this crowded genomics space?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;We are equipped in-house with the latest technologies including Illumina NovaSeq 6000, HiSeq X Ten, HiSeq 4000, NextSeq500, MiSeq and Ion Proton instrumentation. Other factors that gives us an edge are our fast turnaround time and our competitive prices. We offer advanced bioinformatics analysis, including analysis for RNA splicing/RNA editing, and high-quality pictures to our clients for publication purposes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You’ve made it apparent that Quick Biology Inc. has positioned itself as a leader in the genome sequencing field. What role has Science Exchange played in all of this? Has it made a positive impact on your company? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Since the launch of our NGS service on Science Exchange, we’ve had great experiences working with them. Science Exchange is an integral part of our sales and marketing strategies; it gives us exposure to a global scientific community, allows us to build an online reputation, and enables us to attract potential clients quickly. All of these benefits help Quick Biology Inc. to generate more revenue without exhausting our resources. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Science Exchange’s Sourcing Team is the secret ingredient to their successful business model. They are accommodating in mediating conversations or resolving problems with the client promptly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;It’s well-known that we can easily miss objects in our environment that are outside the focus of our conscious attention. “Inattentional blindness” is demonstrated by the famous “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinvisiblegorilla.com/gorilla_experiment.html&quot;&gt;invisible gorilla&lt;/a&gt;” studies, for example. But there’s a darker side to this phenomenon: if it happens while you’re driving – or if you’re a baggage checker at airport security – the consequences could be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29578735&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, by Joshua Eayrs and Nilli Lavie at University College London, published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, shows that some people can handle more visual information than others before developing this and related kinds of attentional blindness, and this is because they have a greater visual perceptual capacity. “We identified a novel trait that is different from working memory, general intelligence or motivational factors,” Lavie said in a press release.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33957&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In initial studies conducted on 279 visitors to the Science Museum in London, Eayrs and Lavie first assessed participants’ perceptual capacity by asking them to rapidly identify the total number of objects in a scene – a so-called “subitizing” task that measures “the simultaneous, parallel processing capacity for detection and individuation of items”. A series of 162 images of between one and nine randomly sized and positioned black squares were presented for 100 milliseconds each. Previous work has found that, on average, people can reliably enumerate about three to four items and a mean of 3.62 was found for this group.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then found that people who were better at subitizing – suggesting that they have higher perceptual capacity – were also better at identifying whether two photographs, presented briefly in rapid succession, were identical or very nearly identical (that is, they were less susceptible to a form of inattention known as “change blindness”).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second study, on 122 more visitors to the Science Museum, the researchers linked a greater subitizing capacity to being less susceptible to “load blindness” as revealed by their superior performance on a task that progressively increased the perceptual load (participants had to try to judge the lengths of lines of an X while also monitoring other changeable elements in the periphery of the scene).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a third study, the researchers explored whether the superior performance of participants with higher perceptual capacity was simply because they have greater working memory capacity.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Working memory describes how much information we can hold and manipulate in mind at any time and it’s a key aspect of cognitive functioning that is known to underlie performance on a range of mental tasks, including tests of attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate group of 43 people completed three different tasks of working memory, as well as the same subitizing task as before, the same change-detection task, and also an object-tracking task, which required them to track four target dots as they moved around the centre of a screen, among four other dots.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While working memory capacity did partially explain object-tracking performance, subitizing performance was also important. Also, perceptual capacity (indicated by results on the subitizing task) strongly predicted the participants’ performance on the photograph change-detection task, even when working memory capacity was controlled for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Taken together, the results indicate that a single unifying construct appears to underlie subitizing, change detection and [object-tracking] and this construct is distinct from working memory capacity,” the researchers write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, they say, the work also establishes the subitizing task as a simple way of quantifying an individual’s general perceptual capacity limit. As such, it provides “a potentially powerful indicator of individual abilities relevant to various tasks” – such as working as a pilot or a baggage screener at an airport. “The present research thus provides a scientific basis for devising future personnel selection tests for security and defense,” Eayrs and Lavie conclude.&lt;/p&gt;

 An Atlantic article from July 2017 has been widely discussed on Twitter over the past few days. It's called Power Causes Brain Damage and I remember that it was fairly popular at the time of publication. Its recent revival was prompted I think by Harvey Weinstein's arrest and more generally the abuses of power revealed by the #MeToo movement. The article itself, of course, dating to the pre-Fall of Weinstein era, isn't specifically about this.

 An author who has published four articles about the alleged risks of vaccines — but who lied about his name and claimed an affiliation with the Karolinska Institutet — has lost one of the papers. He will also lose three more, Retraction Watch has learned.

&lt;p&gt;Pharmacelera is a Computer-Aided Drug Design company developing disruptive computational chemistry solutions to find candidate molecules with more considerable chemical diversity. Pharmacelera’s solutions are based on more than 20 years of research in academia and use accurate 3D molecular descriptors that combine hydrophobic, electrostatic and steric interaction fields derived from semi-empirical quantum-mechanical (QM) computations. This allows screening libraries containing millions of compounds and finds new diverse chemical structures which show similar physicochemical properties to known leads. Such diversity is especially valuable when finding new intellectual property, generating backup compounds, translating natural product into a proper small molecule or overcoming pharmacological limitations of the molecular candidates.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/Untitled-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is generally assumed that exaggerated signals in birds, for example brilliant colors, evolve through the relationship between the females and males, where the sexual form changes throughout time to counteract the opposing sex’s traits. These signals serve to attract a suitable mate, and sexual selection allows for the more desirable traits to continually pass down through the species. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying these signals are not well known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10204&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10204 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/Balearica_pavonina-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Black crowned crane – By Michael Möller (nopics.de) via Wikimedia Commons&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the paper ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-018-1136-y&quot;&gt;Evolution of &lt;em&gt;CYP2J19,&lt;/em&gt; a gene involved in color vision and red coloration in birds: positive selection in the face of conservation and pleiotropy&lt;/a&gt;’, Twyman, Andersson and Mundy investigate the ‘redness gene’. This recently identified gene encodes an enzyme which can modify carotenoids, a class of pigments which produce red, orange and yellow hues. More specifically, the researchers investigated whether the &lt;em&gt;CYP2J19&lt;/em&gt; gene is present in all birds, its copy number in different avian lineages, its pattern of selection across avian genomes, and whether &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;selection changed after the gene was diverted to serve two functions, vision and color, in weaverbirds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10205&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10205&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/RedcrestedTuraco-300x240.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Red-crested turaco – By Daniel Demczuk, from Wikimedia Commons &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined 70 avian genomes, representing all major avian clades. Of these 70 genomes, a single full-length &lt;em&gt;CYP2J19&lt;/em&gt; (the redness gene) was retrieved from 43 of them. Sequences of the redness gene in 13 species of weaverbirds were also analysed, 7 of which contain the carotenoid-modifying enzyme. They found that this gene has been positively selected throughout the rapid diversification of birds, though the cause of this is unclear. Positive selection was found to be common in this gene family in birds, and no evidence was found for a change in selection pressure in the redness gene following a shift in function for red coloration in weaverbirds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results obtained in this study were found to be consistent with the ancestral conserved function of the redness gene in providing colour vision and the red colouration of the skin and its appendages. A single copy of the gene was identified in a phylogenetically broad range of avian lineages, indicating that a single &lt;em&gt;CYP2J19&lt;/em&gt; gene is the &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;ancestral avian state. Red retinal oil droplets are present in almost all birds, yet red colouration is patchy amongst species. This indicates that the colour vision contribution of the &lt;em&gt;CYP2J19&lt;/em&gt; gene is likely its ancestral and widely preserved function. Red colouration appears to have been independently developed along particular bird lineages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/05/25/how-misreading-bodily-signals-causes-anxiety/"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;It’s 9 AM Monday morning. You’ve just pulled into work and are ready to pitch your presentation to the senior management team. Your PowerPoint slides are damn near perfect and you’ve gone over the script dozens of times. You’ve got this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As everyone gathers in the room, you’re suddenly flooded with a hit of adrenaline. The bad kind. In a flash you become acutely aware of what your body is doing: beads of sweat forming on your brow, a dry mouth that no amount of water can fix, and a steadily increasing heart rate thumping inside your chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ability to perceive the signals of your body is known as &lt;em&gt;interoceptive accuracy &lt;/em&gt;(IAc). There are, as the example demonstrated, different psychosomatic cues that you pick up within yourself during states of anxiety. But above all, a beating heart is the hardest one to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s for this reason that &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/02/does-our-heartbeat-influence-our-sensory-awareness/&quot;&gt;heartbeat perception&lt;/a&gt;, as brain scientists call it, is a direct proxy for measuring people’s IAc and reported anxiety and stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IAc and a beating heart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the ability to accurately detect your own heartbeat is critical for reappraising your anxiety on a moment to moment basis. We know that anxiety is as much in the body as it is in the mind, and that a (mis)perception of a fast heart rate can easily contribute to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2007/04/13/do-you-have-panic-attacks/&quot;&gt;catastrophization of a panicked state&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s why some of the most effective anxiety-related therapies, like progressive muscle relaxation and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/01/mind-over-matter-mindfulness-meditation-for-pain-management/&quot;&gt;deep breathing&lt;/a&gt;, tend to focus on muting a physiological response followed by a cognitive reappraisal technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in terms of IAc, the longstanding view was that it is an inherited trait, similar to eye color or height. Your IAc is immutable, unchanging. But now there’s new evidence suggesting that the situation matters just as much as the person: While some people may have inherently bad interoceptive ability, we can’t ignore the influence of the broader context. And this, if it turns out to be true, is a definite win for anyone looking to reverse a certain anxiety-based predisposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study and findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers led by Martin F. Whittkamp out of the University of Luxembourg  set out to investigate just how much of a role the environment plays in determining our ability to self-reflect on accurate &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/27/neurofeedback-therapy-for-the-management-of-pain/&quot;&gt;biofeedback&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers relied on two methods to measure IAc via heartbeat perception. The first, called the counting task is simply a comparison between actual measures of your heartbeat with your self-reported measures. Another method, called the heartbeat discrimination task, measures how accurately you can rate whether or not your heartbeat is in sync with an external stimulus such as a blinking light on a computer screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team in this newest study compared the results of both a heartbeat counting task and discrimination task in two conditions: a resting state and a stress state. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2018/04/09/the-effects-facebook-breaks-and-on-stress-and-well-being/&quot;&gt;Mental stress&lt;/a&gt; was induced by having participants match the color of a flashing light bulb with a corresponding button as fast and accurately as possible. If this wasn’t stressful enough, the experimenter also chimed in with a few verbal cues urging the participant to perform better so as to not ruin the entire experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to comparing stress state IAc with resting state IAc, the researchers also designed a number of computational models. These models aimed to measure how much of one’s interoceptive accuracy is owed to individual ability versus the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results found that about 40% of a person’s IAc can be explained by his/her individual traits, while around 30% can be explained by the changing situation, leaving the remaining 30% to measurement error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this says is that your ability to detect and therefore modulate your bodily responses during an anxious state is not fixed. These signals are amenable to change. You can learn to more accurately perceive your beating heart in a high-stress environment. You can apply reappraisal techniques in mitigating your &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/20/neurological-basis-of-anxiety/&quot;&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study have the potential to inform research on stress and anxiety management. For example, having a general idea of how much your IAc is dependent on biological predisposition could provide leeway to pharmaceutical interventions to help combat debilitating responses to stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now there’s therapeutic power in knowing you can improve your IAc and work towards minimizing your anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychotherapists are devoted to improving people’s psychological health, but sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/03/10/how-often-does-psychotherapy-make-people-feel-worse/&quot;&gt;their efforts fail&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10503307.2018.1453621&quot;&gt;new qualitative study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychotherapy Research&lt;/i&gt; delves into what therapists take away from these unsuccessful experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrzej Werbart led the Stockholm University research team that focused on eight therapy cases where the clients – all women under the age of 26 – had experienced no improvement, or in three cases, had deteriorated. This was based on comparing their pre- and post-therapy symptom levels following one to two sessions per week of psychoanalytically-focused therapy for about two years, to deal with symptoms such as depressed mood, anxiety, or low self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33965&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seven therapists responsible for these cases (one had two non-improving clients) were also all women, average age 53, with a range of experience in therapy.  Each had had success in leading other clients to improvement, which is typical; the evidence shows even strong therapists have cases that fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapists took part in interviews at the start and end of treatment using the Private Theories Interview – a way of exploring the therapist’s take on the case, how they are approaching it, and (retrospectively) what could have been handled differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Werbart’s team used the grounded theory tradition to look for emerging patterns in the interviews and found a paradoxical picture. On the one hand, the therapists talked of the great first impressions they’d formed of these cases; they had a clear sense of empathy with the clients’ plight, and engaged with their interesting stories or quick wits. They also said they had felt a connection, even admiration; these were special cases, and the therapist was motivated to do right by them. They also reported that the clients seemed to be attracted to the process, at least on the surface, finding it intellectually stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the therapists also reported that from the very beginning there was a sense the clients were somehow removed. This was the first inkling of what Werbart’s team found to be a key theme, of “having half of the patient in therapy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially the therapists said they were optimistic that this was a solvable challenge, but as the sessions continued, it became a mire. Whenever the therapists attempted to address what a client was not disclosing, the client would typically pull back – by intellectualising around issues, or holding back revelations until the session was nearly over. Later, some clients became impersonal in manner and treated the therapist as just a part of the furniture, or they cancelled sessions entirely. The therapists described how trying more actively to wrest back control led to “fruitless battles”, and the process terminated with the therapist in an emotional state, overwhelmed by the client’s energy. One therapist reported “I felt I was drawn into some damned depth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Werbart’s team speculate that the paradoxical elements – high initial promise and enthusiasm followed by the later sense of distance – may form two parts of a whole, the case of a therapist “one-sidedly [allying] herself with the patient’s more capable and seemingly well-functioning parts.” These clients are clearly sharp, and may have developed shiny, effective defence mechanisms that took the therapist in. Evidence shows that therapists who initially underestimate the degree of the client’s problems are more likely to struggle, and that successful outcomes begin with a good reading of the situation, not sceptical, but not credulous either. Regarding the current cases, the therapists may have been beguiled by their client’s charisma, and were on the back foot when they belatedly began to dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite acknowledging the lack of improvement in their clients, the therapists maintained that the therapy they’d offered had been useful – that their clients had grown in self-awareness, laying groundwork for improvement, if only there were more time. While this interpretation can’t be ruled out, the therapists’ insistence on it may reflect a reluctance to acknowledge their being taken in by their clients’ defences. This is perhaps because being a therapist – especially in ultimately successful therapy – is associated with unpleasant feelings, as progress means getting into hard and upsetting issues. A rare case that generates strong feelings of engagement, connection and excitement – even in the absence of tangible improvements – may feel like a welcome change, and it may be hard to acknowledge that the such situations are not cause for celebration, but for caution.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/this-is-your-brain-on-junk-food-according-to-a-neuroscientist-part-6/"/>
		<id>http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/?p=5518</id>
		<updated>2018-05-25T00:32:11+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-5519 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2681667053_e5439c9d6c_z.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We know high fat and high sugar “junk” foods are bad for our health, but we often sneak them into our diets. Sometimes it just feels like our brain wants us to eat a bar of chocolate or scoff down a whole pizza.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neuroscientists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://amyreichelt.com/&quot;&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; have been studying the effects of these foods on the brain, which helps us to understand how diets can affect brain function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is Part 6 and the final of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/category/gut-brain-axis/&quot;&gt;series on the gut-brain axis&lt;/a&gt;, diet and brain health. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Your brain loves junk foods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brains are hardwired to make you want to engage in the behaviours you find pleasurable – like having sex, socialising and eating tasty foods – all vital for the survival of a species. When you eat tasty junk foods your brain’s reward system (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/mesolimbic-pathway&quot;&gt;mesolimbic dopamine system&lt;/a&gt;) activates and releases the neurotransmitter &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/dopamine-cause-digital-addiction/&quot;&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the brain &lt;em&gt;adapts&lt;/em&gt; when we eat lots of rewarding foods and responds by making more receptors for dopamine. The simplest way to think of the interaction between dopamine (or any neurotransmitter) and its receptor is to think of a lock and key where the receptor is the lock and the neurotransmitter is the key. Turning the key sparks a neural impulse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we make more dopamine receptors, we need to eat more of the reward (junk foods) to get the same ‘goooooood’ feeling, similar to how addicts can develop a tolerance to drugs. The brain wants us to eat tasty foods and then it wants more, and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Junk foods grab our attention and make us impulsive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our attention is drawn towards what feels good, and in a world full of junk foods it can be difficult to resist sweet temptations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain’s decision-making centre – the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/prefrontal-cortex&quot;&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; – controls our behaviour. Eating excess junk foods can &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180510&quot;&gt;impair prefrontal cortex function&lt;/a&gt;. This can lead to impulsive behaviours and poor decision making – like eating a whole box of cookies instead of cooking a healthy meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fighting these temptations is difficult when faced with the strategic placement of sweet treats by supermarket checkouts, chocolate muffins in your local coffee shop, or bold adverts for fast food. All of these prompts trigger us to want these foods and can be hard to resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Junk foods can impair your memory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high levels of refined sugars and saturated fats in junk foods leads to a state of inflammation in the brain that damages brain cells (neurons). Rats that gorged themselves on a diet of sugary drinks, cakes and cookies for just five days had signs of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26970578&quot;&gt;inflammation in the hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; and struggled with memory tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-happens-in-the-hippocampus-32589&quot;&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; is the brain’s memory centre and is vital for remembering new information. Neurons in the hippocampus form connections that are constantly being reorganised, a process we call &lt;em&gt;neuroplasticity&lt;/em&gt;. This enables us to learn and form memories in response to the constant influx of information in our dynamic world. Junk food filled diets also reduces key brain chemicals required for neuroplasticity, impairing memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research also shows that people who eat lots of junk food also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22023100&quot;&gt;perform badly in memory tests&lt;/a&gt; compared to those who eat healthily, irrespective of body weight (i.e. you don’t have to be overweight for these foods to impact your brain’s health).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But it’s not all bad news…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding how junk foods can impact your brain, it one simple steps to modify your lifestyles to reduce their negative effects. It is important to be aware of what is in the foods we eat, particularly when pre-packaged foods are marketed as ‘healthy’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercising and eating healthily are vital for keeping both our body and brains in good shape. I hope you read my previous blog about foods that can boost your brain’s performance…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way parents and teachers praise children is known to influence not only their future performance, but how they feel about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/09/18/seven-year-olds-beliefs-about-ability-are-associated-with-the-way-they-were-praised-as-toddlers/&quot;&gt;malleability of intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. If a child has done well, focusing positive comments on their efforts, actions and strategies (saying, for example, “good job” or “you must have tried really hard”) is preferable to saying “you’re so smart”, in part because process-centred praise is thought to encourage kids to interpret setbacks as opportunities to grow, rather than as threats to their self-concept. In contrast, a kid who’s led to believe she succeeds because she’s “intelligent” may not attempt a difficult challenge, in case she fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now – and somewhat remarkably, given all the praise and growth mindset research conducted on children – a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00221325.2018.1441801&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, led by Rachael Reavis at Earlham College, Indiana, US, published the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Genetic Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, claims to be the first to test the effects of different types of praise on how adults feel after failure.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33947&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 156 adults via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk website. After completing a set of six easy visual pattern problems, which they were given up to two minutes to solve, they were all informed: “You did better than the majority of adults!” But then the feedback varied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a third were told that, based on the pattern of their results, they had been classified as “in the high intelligence group” (person-focused ability feedback); about a third were told they had been classified as “the kind of person who works hard” (person-focused effort feedback – they were a “hard worker”) and about a third were told they had been classified as “working hard on these questions” (process-focused effort feedback – they had worked hard).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All participants were then given a set of 12 difficult problems (which timed out after 3.5 minutes), and no matter how well they did, all were told that their performance was “worse than most adults”. The researchers were interested in how the earlier feedback would affect the participants’ performance and enjoyment on the tasks, and especially how they would interpret their apparent failure at the final set of difficult problems.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based partly on previous findings involving children, the researchers expected that being told you’re a “hard worker” would be the most beneficial kind of praise or feedback, as it implies that the person typically puts in a lot of effort. (And while this form of praise is person-centred, it focuses on behaviour, rather than on intrinsic ability.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the type of feedback participants received after the easy task did not affect their performance on the difficult problems, relative to their performance on the first. Meanwhile, it was the “hard worker” group who said they enjoyed the difficult set of problems &lt;em&gt;the least&lt;/em&gt; (the other two groups did not differ from each other on this); they also believed they had been less successful on the tasks than those in the other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, when the participants indicated, on a scale of 0 to 10, to what extent they attributed their poor performance at the final task to lack of effort or to lack of intelligence (as well as to eight other factors that were included to obscure the true purpose of the study), there were no group differences for effort, but as expected, those in the “worked hard” group were significantly less likely to attribute their failure to their level of intelligence than those in the “high intelligence group”. However, against expectations, the “hard worker” group actually blamed their low intelligence just as much as the “high intelligence” participants.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researchers note, “Few of the results demonstrated with children were replicated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why might this be?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that adults believe that telling someone they’re a hard worker is something positive to say when you can’t plausibly say that they’re smart or gifted. When I think back to my own childhood, there were awards at school for “good work” and also for “hard work”, and, among the kids, a “good work” award was seen as being the bigger achievement. In contrast, at my children’s primary school, in the light of the findings on process-focused praise, rewards are focused entirely on effort. However, it’s also standard for a child who typically puts in a lot of effort to be called a “hard worker”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For children today, this may perhaps still be beneficial. For adults, who grew up in a different time, “being told one is a ‘hard worker’ may elicit feelings of inadequacy, which undermine positive perceptions of the task,” the researchers write. “Future work should investigate how both children and adults interpret these types of praise.”&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h4&gt;Researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience discovered a new way that the protein RGS14 functions as a molecular brake on learning and memory&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain has an incredible capacity to support a lifetime of learning and memory. Each new experience fundamentally alters the connections between cells in the brain called synapses. To accommodate synaptic alterations, certain areas of the brain are highly plastic, meaning that have the ability to adapt to incoming information. Within an important brain structure for memory, the hippocampus, reside some of the most plastic cells in the entire brain, utilizing the process of synaptic plasticity to remain primed and flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestled between the highly plastic CA1 and CA3 regions, the rather inflexible neurons of area CA2 do not readily undergo synaptic plasticity, sharply contrasting the functional properties of its close neighbors. Once underappreciated, the CA2 region is now understood to be important for social, spatial, and temporal aspects of memory as well as the target of caffeine’s cognitive boosting effects. Determining the unique factors that confer this unique resistivity to plasticity could provide vital insights into the neural basis of learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignright imgCaption margin20right&quot; id=&quot;attachment_5698&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Figure-2-EurekAlert.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-5698&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Figure-2-EurekAlert.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Signaling diagram of a CA2 dendritic spine from a RGS14 KO mouse depicting mechanistic targets of the pharmacological inhibitors of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent signaling pathways investigated in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determined to elucidate this mystery of plasticity, researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) in collaboration with researchers at Emory University and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, have for the first time identified a novel role for the CA2-enriched protein RGS14 and provided insights into the mechanism by which it limits plasticity. Paul Evans, Ph.D., a Post-doctoral Researcher in Ryohei Yasuda’s Lab, and collaborators, published a study in May 2018 in the journal eNeuro that links RGS14’s ability to curb plasticity to calcium regulation. RGS14, a specialized scaffolding protein, contains an amalgam of unique domains. Previous proteomics work by Evans and colleagues exploring these domains, established two new RGS14 interacting partners: CaMKII, a calcium signaling protein and Calmodulin, a calcium binding protein and crucial calcium regulator. To initiate the signaling cascade of synaptic plasticity in CA1 neurons, the influx of calcium into the cell is required to drive the activity of CaMKII and Calmodulin. Due to this relationship, RGS14 is poised to act as a calcium modulator, gating plasticity in CA2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To verify this proposed relationship, Evans and collaborators probed in greater detail the masked form of plasticity, called Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), that is awoken in CA2 neurons when RGS14 is removed. Notably, mice lacking RGS14 display both enhanced learning in addition to robust CA2 synaptic plasticity, on par with levels reported in CA1. To ascertain if this latent CA2 plasticity is similar to the calcium-driven mechanisms of CA1, the team employed precise pharmacological inhibitors targeting critical calcium signaling molecules in mice lacking RGS14. Strikingly, the inhibitors abolished the newly unveiled LTP in CA2 neurons lacking RGS14, demonstrating the necessity of calcium signaling in CA2 and revealing similarities to the mechanisms that underlie plasticity in CA1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirming calcium signaling as a critical component of quiescent plasticity in CA2, Evans next investigated calcium influx in small neuronal compartments called dendritic spines during LTP in CA2 neurons from mice containing and lacking RGS14. Calcium transients in spines from mice containing RGS14 were significantly smaller than those in mice lacking RGS14, indicating that RGS14 plays an important role in adjusting calcium levels in CA2 neurons. Furthermore, the acute overexpression of RGS14 in CA2 neurons lacking the protein once again abolished plasticity and significantly reduced plasticity when expressed in the CA1 region. Increasing extracellular calcium levels reversed the abolition of plasticity, reinforcing the notion that RGS14 exerts its plasticity restricting properties through the regulation of calcium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RGS14 seems to be special, acting as a molecular factor that puts the brakes on plasticity when it’s present, enabling specialized types of memory encoding. Establishing a greater understanding of the molecular makeup conferring subtle differences between brain regions, like those seen in CA1 and CA2, will allow us to better understand the mechanisms that underlie learning and memory,” notes Dr. Evans.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Although early experiences are important for personal development and future life, as adults we recall nothing or very little of those early formative events, such as making first steps or &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2018/02/14/why-children-learn-foreign-languages-easily/&quot;&gt;learning first words&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, when adults are asked about their first memories they usually don’t recall events before the age of 2-3, with only fragmented recollection of events that happened between the age of 3 and 7. This phenomenon is often called childhood or infantile amnesia. It represents an inability of both children and adults to recall episodic memories (i.e., memories for particular events or stimuli that occur in a particular context) from infancy and early childhood, before the age 2-4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigmund Freud was the first researcher to develop the theory of infantile amnesia, as he had observed that his patients rarely had been able to recall memories of events that took place during the first years of life. He believed that &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2015/08/25/repressed-memories-fact-or-fiction/&quot;&gt;childhood memories are being repressed&lt;/a&gt; and thus forgotten. Still, modern theories focus on cognitive and social development as an important predictor of childhood amnesia. One possible explanation of childhood amnesia is the lack of neurological development, i.e., the development of brain parts that are in charge of storage and retrieval of episodic memories. For instance, some researchers believe that the development and functioning of the prefrontal cortex (cortex area at the front of the brain) is crucial for the creation of contextualized memories. Moreover, the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are assumed to be crucial for the development of autobiographical memories. Importantly, these two brain structures develop around the age of 3 or 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of neurological maturation, i.e., maturation of brain structures required for creation, storage, and recall of memories during infancy and early childhood might explain the phenomenon of childhood amnesia. According to this explanation, childhood amnesia occurs not due to the loss of memories over time (&lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2014/04/20/deliberately-forgetting-memories-easy-for-some/&quot;&gt;the forgetting explanation&lt;/a&gt;), as Freud had suggested, but rather due to the lack of storing of these memories in the first place. The lack of stored memories, according to this theory, is due to brain immaturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some evidence has suggested that amnesia for events taking place in early childhood (before the age of 2) could be at least partly explained by difficulties with verbally recalling memories that were encoded before language acquisition. In line with this is the fact that the majority of words (the vocabulary) are acquired between the age of 2 years and 6 months and 4 years and 6 months. This is the time period that the earliest memories can be recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Childhood amnesia seems not to be an exclusively human phenomenon. Indeed, some researchers have observed something like infantile amnesia in animals (for instance, rodents). The discovery of amnesia in animals has pointed to the possibility of investigating the underlying mechanisms of childhood amnesia, such as neurological events, by using animal models. The animal studies have addressed the importance of some parts of brain and their development in relation to the childhood amnesia. For instance, they have indicated that high rate of neurogenesis in hippocampus as observed in infancy might explain the accelerated forgetting of contextual fear memories. It seems that integrating of new neurons into the existing circuit might destabilize and weaken the existing memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some researchers believe that it is unclear whether childhood amnesia occurs due to the failure of &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/04/how-do-we-improve-our-working-memory/&quot;&gt;memory retrieval&lt;/a&gt; or failure of their storage. Forgetting might be described as a linear function of the time passing since the event. Since there is a long time span between the early events and recall in adulthood, it might be assumed that early events are simply forgotten. Still, some researchers disagree. This is because they have found that subjects recall far less memories for events occurring between the age of 6 and 7 as would be expected by simply extrapolating the forgetting curve. Thus, forgetting could not completely explain the phenomenon of childhood amnesia. This is why a neurogenic hypothesis of childhood amnesia has been developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to its inventors, a neurogenic hypothesis explains childhood amnesia through the continuous adding of new neurons (neurogenesis) in the hippocampus, as already mentioned above. According to this hypothesis, high levels of postnatal neurogenesis (which occurs in both humans and some animals) in the hippocampus prevents the creation of long-lasting memories. This hypothesis has been experimentally tested in animal models (mouse and rat). The findings emerging from these models have proposed that high levels of neurogenesis jeopardize the formation of long-term memories, possibly by replacement of synapses in pre-existing memory circuits. In addition, the same findings indicate that the decline in hippocampal neurogenesis corresponds with the emerging ability to form stabile memories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, according to these animal studies, the theory of neurogenesis appears to be a logical explanation for childhood amnesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the early theory regarding the forgetting or repressing of memories might look like a good explanation of childhood amnesia, more recent findings demonstrate that something else is happening in our brain that contributes to this phenomenon. Whether this is the lack of development in some brain parts, or the continuous synthesis of new neurons, or both, remains to be further investigated. Childhood amnesia cannot be explained by simple forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Big Society” initiative – launched at the turn of this decade by the incoming British government – was&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;a call for politics to recognise the importance of community and social solidarity. It has since fizzled out, and for a while communitarianism fell out of the political conversation, but it has returned post-Brexit, sometimes with a nationalist or even nativist flavour. The US political scientist Robert Putnam’s research is sometimes recruited into these arguments, as his data suggests that racially and ethnically diverse neighbourhoods have lower levels of trust and social capital, which would seem an obstacle to community-building. But an international team led by Jared Nai at Singapore Management University has published &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-13651-001&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/i&gt; that suggests that diverse neighbourhoods are in fact &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; likely to generate prosocial helpful behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33944&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putnam’s work tallies with a distinguished psychological idea, &lt;i&gt;conflict theory&lt;/i&gt;, which suggests salient distinctions between people in an area heightens a sense of competition between groups over resources. Because race is so visible – &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.85.4.616&quot;&gt;neuroscientific studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; we perceive it earlier even than gender – the argument goes that racially diverse areas lead people to, as Putnam puts it, hunker down and withdraw. Consistent with this view, Putnam’s data shows that multicultural areas have lower levels of trust – even between people of the same race – and some evidence, but not all, has shown this has a knock-on adverse effect on civic engagement and volunteering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nai’s team predicted that despite this, racially diverse areas would show more, not less prosocial helping. They drew on &lt;i&gt;contact theory&lt;/i&gt;, which suggests that active contact with people from other groups humanises them. In particular, such contact leads people to view their own identity as broader, potentially encompassing all of humanity – this could be a mechanism to encourage prosociality. As most of the contact theory work puts people in extended face to face interactions, the question was whether mere ambient diversity will help (simply being around other people who look different).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first study showed that diverse areas have a more prosocial online buzz. Nai’s team pulled 60 million tweets and identified the usage frequency of words from James Pennebaker’s “prosocial dictionary” that are known to correlate with a desire to help others. Indexing across 200 metropolitan areas, they found that tweets from more racially diverse areas used prosocial language more frequently. But language is an indirect measure, and it may be that people with that style voluntarily move into areas that are more diverse. So Nai’s group looked at international data, as moving country is rarer than moving cities, and at levels of actual (reported) helping. The data came from a 2012 Gallop World Poll that asked “in the past month, have you helped a stranger?”. Across 128 countries, Nai’s team found that it was the more ethnically diverse countries that scored a greater frequency of yes responses to this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Nai’s team wanted to see if the factor that turned diversity into helping was people having a broader sense of identity. They surveyed US people online using the same helping question used in the Gallop poll, and replicated the greater diversity/greater helping correlation for different zip codes for around 500 participants (good gender balance, average age 33). They also asked the participants how much they identified with three groups: people in my community, Americans, and all humans everywhere. They found that diverse neighbourhoods were associated with higher identification with all of humanity, and statistical analysis suggested, but could not prove, that this (and only this) form of identification was driving the helping behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the researchers looked at help for outsiders during a crisis. Real data from a helping website set up following the Boston marathon showed that more offers of help came from zip codes that were more racially diverse, even after controlling for distance from site and wealth of the zip code. And in an online experiment, 300 participants stated they would be more likely to offer help following a bombing when they had been asked to imagine living in a very diverse neighbourhood – again mediated by a greater sense of connection to humanity.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the studies controlled for a range of factors related to area or nation, such as income / national economics, education, urbanisation, and religious diversity. One weakness is that apart from the last study, all this work is correlational. It would be interesting to track neighbourhoods over time to see how changes have an impact dynamically – maybe an area renowned for its diversity that evolved organically over decades would have a different attitude to the idea of “one humanity” than a neighbourhood with no sense of itself as diverse per se and that had changed fairly rapidly due to impersonal market or governmental forces.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting detail from the international study is that trust scores (available for a subset of nations) were lower in more ethnically diverse countries, in line with the Putnam data. So it seems that a populace can both be less trusting and more willing to help strangers, which is something to puzzle on. But regardless, the new data pushes back against the assertion that diverse neighbourhoods struggle to show communal spirit, and suggests that ambient contact with those superficially different can underscore our common humanity and obligations to one another.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title type="html">On the top of all the wonderful stories, there is one thing, I think, could bring your podcast to  another level of perfection:  Is it possible to list some of the information mentioned in the interview?  Such as in #31 Trial and Error Learning, Dr. Niv mentioned a book that brought her into the field of Neural Science -- I would like to read the book, but failed to find it because I can't get the name of the book right, given English is my second language... Please?</title>

 &lt;p&gt;This is a terrific idea.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/Eating-Disorders-Pregnancy-1-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating disorders are mental illnesses characterized by severely disturbed eating behaviors and cognitions that impact on an individual’s health and wellbeing. Research suggests around 7.5% of women are affected with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23495197&quot;&gt;eating disorders during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and there is an increased risk of pregnancy complications (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17329747&quot;&gt;1,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18720472&quot;&gt;2,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3873840/&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, pregnancy can be a difficult time emotionally for some women with eating disorders as they encounter changes to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/papt.12076&quot;&gt;appetite and body weight and shape&lt;/a&gt; that are beyond their control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the increased risks, health professionals need to be able to identify women with eating disorders during and after pregnancy so that they can effectively monitor and support these women in accordance with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng69&quot;&gt;clinical guidance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stigma of having an eating disorder, as is common with other mental health problems, means women are unlikely to say that they have an eating disorder without being directly asked by a health professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We carried out a qualitative study to understand the potential barriers to identifying eating disorders from the perspectives of both women and midwives and health visitors. These health professionals are important as they often have the most contact with women during antenatal and early years’ care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify an eating disorder, health professionals need to be able to enquire effectively with women and likewise women need to openly disclose their difficulties. Health professionals receive little to no training on eating disorders so they may lack the knowledge and understanding to confidently ask women about these difficulties. The stigma of having an eating disorder, as is common with other mental health problems, means women are unlikely to say that they have an eating disorder without being directly asked by a health professional. Thus, eating disorders can go undetected during this time and women will not receive the care and support they may need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two foreseeable approaches that could address these barriers to improve the identification of women experiencing eating disorders during and after pregnancy. Firstly, our research highlights the lack of training resources on eating disorders available for health professionals. This finding has led on to work with King’s College London, funded by The Health Foundation, to translate the research and clinical guidance into practical and engaging training resources for health professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resources include a short animation film that has been co-designed by women with eating disorders, health professionals and key organisations, such as Tommy’s, Beat and the Institute of Health Visiting. We launched the resources during Eating Disorders Awareness Week 2018 and they are available for free at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eatingdisordersandpregnancy.co.uk&quot;&gt;www.eatingdisordersandpregnancy.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, many public health campaigns have been launched in the UK to raise awareness and reduce stigma about mental health, but eating disorders, and particularly highlighting the experience of pregnant women and mothers, have been missing in these campaigns. Campaigns are needed to specifically target eating disorders during and after pregnancy. Awareness raising activities may empower pregnant women and mothers with eating disorders to be able to talk openly and access support without worrying about negative judgements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of activities that raise both professional and public awareness about eating disorders can help facilitate open and informed discussions between a woman and a health professional, and enables that health professional to be able to plan and deliver tailored care that is responsive to the specific needs of that woman. This type of tailored care could not only improve pregnancy outcomes but also patient experience, which is often as important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/05/22/better-training-could-help-health-professionals-identify-and-support-pregnant-women-with-eating-disorders/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Better training could help health professionals identify and support pregnant women with eating disorders&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;BMC Series blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;“Our country doesn’t do many things well, but when it comes to big occasions, no one else comes close,” so claimed an instructor I heard at the gym this week. He might be an expert in physical fitness but it’s doubtful this chap was drawing on any evidence or established knowledge about the UK’s standing on the international league table of pageantry or anything else, and what’s more, he probably didn’t care about his oversight. What he probably did feel is a social pressure to have an opinion on the royal wedding that took place last weekend. To borrow the terminology of US psychologist John Petrocelli, he was probably bullshitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In essence,” Petrocelli explains in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103117305127&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, “the bullshitter is a relatively careless thinker/communicator and plays fast and loose with ideas and/or information as he bypasses consideration of, or concern for, evidence and established knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While pontificating on Britain’s prowess at pomp is pretty harmless, Petrocelli has more serious topics in mind. “Whether they be claims or expressions of opinions about the effects of vaccinations, the causes of success and failure, or political ideation, doing so with little to no concern for evidence or truth is wrong,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are countless psychology studies into &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/category/lying/&quot;&gt;lying&lt;/a&gt; (which is different from bullshitting because it involves deliberately concealing the truth) and an increasing number into &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/12/11/fake-news-leaves-a-particularly-lasting-impression-on-the-less-smart/&quot;&gt;fake news&lt;/a&gt; (again, unlike BS, deliberate manipulation is part of it). However, there are virtually none on bullshitting. Now Petrocelli has made a start, identifying several social factors that encourage or deter the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33935&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research began with nearly 600 people on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk survey website reading that a man named Jim had pulled out of running for a seat on the City Council. Participants thought they were taking part in a study of how we ascribe causes to others’ behaviour (the term bullshitting did not appear anywhere in the experiment instructions), and after they read about Jim’s resignation, they were invited to list five possible reasons and any related thoughts on why Jim might have done this – a perfect opportunity for bullshitters to let rip!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrocelli varied the precise conditions to see how this affected people’s propensity to bullshit when answering. For starters, he manipulated background knowledge by earlier on giving half the participants 13 facts about Jim, such as that he liked to be admired. Petrocelli also manipulated the social pressure to give an opinion, telling half the participants they didn’t have to list any reasons if they didn’t want to. Finally, Petrocelli manipulated audience knowledge, telling half the participants that their reasons would be scored by judges who knew Jim extremely well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure bullshitting, Petrocelli later asked the participants to score their own reasons, based on how much they had been concerned with genuine evidence and established knowledge; essentially they assessed their own BS levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the factors that Petrocelli manipulated made a difference. Overall, the participants who received no background information on Jim admitted to engaging in more bullshitting. Participants also bullshitted more when they felt more obliged to give an opinion, and when their audience was not knowledgeable about him. These latter two factors (obligation and audience knowledge) interacted, with social obligation being more potent. When feeling obligated to have an opinion, uninformed participants bullshitted a lot even when they knew their audience knew more than they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anything that an audience may do to enhance the social expectation that one should have or provide an opinion appears to increase the likelihood of the audience receiving bullshit,” Petrocelli said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without such pressure, however, the risk of being caught out was a deterrent to BS and Petrocelli further explored what he calls the “ease of passing bullshit hypothesis” in a follow up experiment. Online participants were invited to justify their attitudes on hot-button social issues: affirmative action; nuclear weapons; and capital punishment. Crucially, Petrocelli manipulated who participants thought would be reading their justifications – either he gave participants no information about their audience or he told them a sociology professor with expertise on these issues would be reading their views (and further, that the prof either agreed with their positions; disagreed; or his own position was concealed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants subsequently rated their own BS levels (i.e. they rated whether they’d been concerned with evidence or established knowledge) and it was the participants not told about a professor, or who thought the professor agreed with them, who especially admitted to more bullshitting. Those participants who knew a professor with opposing views was going to read their arguments admitted to the least bullshitting. Fear of being called out, in other words, appears to be a strong deterrent to spewing BS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does this leave us? It’s a shame there was no objective marker of bullshitting in this research – sure, it makes sense to ask people if they considered any evidence or knowledge, but at least some kind of third-party assessment would have been useful. You might also have your doubts about the realism of these online experiments. Giving inconsequential opinions on a survey website is rather removed from the real life scourge of the office colleague who is forever sharing their questionable wisdom on what you need to do to stay healthy or how the country should be run. Nonetheless, all empirical investigations must start somewhere and Petrocelli said his studies “provide a great deal of information relevant to the social psychology of bullshitting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professor is under no illusions though about how hard it will be to translate his insights into practical anti-BS strategies. While his findings suggest that calling out BS (or the mere threat that it might be called out) can reduce the propensity for bullshitting to take place, Petrocelli notes that doing so “may not necessarily enhance evidence-based communication” and that instead it may just be a “conversation killer”. He concludes that “future research will do well to respond to such questions empirically and determine effective ways of enhancing the concern for evidence and truth.”&lt;/p&gt;

(2018)&lt;/a&gt; is the latest entry into the iconoclastic hullabaloo claiming a non-synaptic basis for learning and memory. In short, “RNA extracted from the central nervous system of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplysia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;sea slug, a common model system to study the neurobiology of learning and memory&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; given long-term sensitization training induced sensitization when injected into untrained animals...” The results support the minority view that long-term memory is not encoded by synaptic strength, according to the authors, but instead by molecules inside cells (à la &lt;a href=&quot;http://nautil.us/blog/heres-why-most-neuroscientists-are-wrong-about-the-brain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Here's Why Most Neuroscientists Are Wrong About the Brain&quot;&gt;Randy Gallistel&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam Calhoun has a nice summary of the paper at &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuroecology.wordpress.com/2018/05/17/learn-by-consuming-the-brains-of-your-enemies/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Learn by consuming the brains of your enemies&quot;&gt;Neuroecology&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;...there is a particular &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;reflex&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(memory) that changes when they [&lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;] have  experienced a lot of shocks. How memory is encoded is a bit debated but  one strongly-supported mechanism (especially in these snails) is that  there are changes in the amount of particular proteins that are  expressed in some neurons. These proteins might make more of one channel  or receptor that makes it more or less likely to respond to signals  from other neurons. So for instance, when a snail receives its first  shock a neuron responds and it withdraws its gills. Over time, each  shock builds up more proteins that make the neuron respond more and  more. These proteins are built up by the amount of RNA (the “blueprint”  for the proteins, if you will) that are located in the vicinity of the  neuron that can receive this information.  ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new paper shows that in these snails, you can just dump the RNA  on these neurons from someone else and the RNA has already encoded  something about the type of protein it will produce.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2018/05/18/epic-snail-about-that-injectable-memory-study/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Slug Life: About That Injectable Memory Study&quot;&gt;Neuroskeptic&lt;/a&gt; has a more contentious take on the study, casting doubt on the notion that sensitization of a simple reflex to any noxious stimulus (a form of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.angelfire.com/linux/vjtorley/habitlearn.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Should we call habituation and sensitization 'learning'?&quot;&gt;non-associative “learning”&lt;/a&gt;) produces “memories” as we typically think of them. But senior author Dr. David Glanzman tolerated none of this, and expressed strong disagreement in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://disq.us/p/1sm8h93&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“I’m afraid you have a fundamental misconception of what memory is. We claim that our experiments demonstrate transfer of the memory—or  essential components of the memory—for sensitization.  Now, although  sensitization may not comport with the common notion of memory—it’s not  like the memory of my Midwestern grandmother’s superb blueberry pies,  for example—it nevertheless has unambiguous status as memory.  ...  [&lt;i&gt;didactic lesson continues&lt;/i&gt;] ...  We do not claim in our paper that declarative memories—such as my  memory of my grandmother’s blueberry pies—or even simpler forms of  associative memories like those induced during classical  conditioning—can be transferred by RNA.   That remains to be seen.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so Glanzman gets to define what memory is. But later on he's caught in a trap and &lt;a href=&quot;http://disq.us/p/1smxqvo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has to admit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“Of course, there are many phenomena that can be loosely regarded as  memory—the crease in folded paper, for example, can be said to represent  the memory of a physical action.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was in response to &lt;span class=&quot;post-byline&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;author publisher-anchor-color&quot;&gt;Harvey-6-3.5, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://disq.us/p/1smwxbk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;who said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“So a transfer of RNA that activates a cellular mechanism associated with  touch isn't memory, but rather just exogenously turning on a cellular  pathway.  By that logic, gene therapy to treat sickle cell anemia  changes blood &quot;memory&quot;.”&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my favorite comment was from &lt;a href=&quot;http://disq.us/p/1smzrw4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Smut Clyde&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“Kandel set the precedent that reflexes in Aplysia are &quot;memories&quot;, and now we're stuck with it.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This reminded me of Dr. Kandel's bold [&lt;i&gt;outlandish?&lt;/i&gt;] attempt to link psychoanalysis, &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt; withdrawal reflexes, and human anxiety (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6137962&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kandel, 1983&lt;/a&gt;). I was a bit flabbergasted that gill withdrawal in a sea slug was considered “mentation” (thought) and could support Freudian views.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;In the past, ascribing a particular behavioral feature to an unobservable mental process essentially excluded the problem from direct biological study because the complexity of the brain posed a barrier to any complementary biological analysis. But the nervous systems of invertebrates are quite accessible to a cellular analysis of behavior, including certain internal representations of environmental experiences that can now be explored in detail; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;This encourages the belief that elements of cognitive mentation relevant to humans and related to psychoanalytic theory can be explored directly [&lt;i&gt;in Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;] and need no longer be merely inferred.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;- click on image for a larger view -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MurE3Re02sE/WwKP1D_5D6I/AAAAAAAAMi0/dxixVXIvQe8d6Rp47OZz87ot0v3CZicewCLcBGAs/s1600/kandel%2B1983.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;565&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1077&quot; height=&quot;219&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MurE3Re02sE/WwKP1D_5D6I/AAAAAAAAMi0/dxixVXIvQe8d6Rp47OZz87ot0v3CZicewCLcBGAs/s400/kandel%2B1983.png&quot; width=&quot;420&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anticipatory anxiety in humans is isomorphic to invertebrate responses in a classical aversive conditioning paradigm, and chronic anxiety is recreated by long-term sensitization paradigms. Perhaps I missed the translational advances here, and any application to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/sections/psychoanalysis-and-neuropsychoanalysis#articles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Psychoanalytic and Neuropsychoanalytic&lt;/a&gt; practice that has been fully realized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we want to accept a flexible definition of learning and memory in animals, why not consider associative learning experiments in pea plants, where a neutral cue predicting the location of a light source had a greater effect on the direction of plant growth than innate phototropism  (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep38427&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gagliano et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;)? Or review the literature on associative and non-associative learning in &lt;i&gt;Mimosa&lt;/i&gt;? (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4814444/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Abramson &amp;amp; Chicas-Mosier, 2016&lt;/a&gt;). Or evaluate the field of ‘plant neurobiology’ and even the ‘Philosophy of Plant Neurobiology’ (&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-016-1040-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Calvo, 2016&lt;/a&gt;). Or are the possibilities of chloroplast-based consciousness and “mentation” without neurons too threatening (&lt;i&gt;or &lt;/i&gt;too fringe)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the end, we know we've reached peak plant cognition when a predictive coding model appears — &lt;i&gt;Predicting green: really radical (plant) predictive processing&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5493793/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Calvo &amp;amp; Friston, 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further Reading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.ca/2017/04/the-big-ideas-in-cognitive-neuroscience.html&quot;&gt;The Big Ideas in Cognitive Neuroscience, Explained&lt;/a&gt; (especially the sections on Gallistel and Ryan)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neurocritic.blogspot.ca/2017/04/what-are-big-ideas-in-cognitive.html&quot;&gt;What are the Big Ideas in Cognitive Neuroscience?&lt;/a&gt; (you can watch the videos of their 2017 CNS talks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;edited to indicate my emphasis on &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;reflex&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd yZ8quc&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; more specifically, the gill withdrawal reflex in &lt;i&gt;Aplysia &lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ILfuVd yZ8quc&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; which can only go so far as a model of other forms of memory, in my view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2  &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Another skeptic (but for different reasons) is Dr. Tomás Ryan, who was paraphrased in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/memory-transferred-between-snails-challenging-standard-theory-of-how-the-brain-remembers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Memory Transferred between Snails, Challenging Standard Theory of How the Brain Remembers&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scientific American&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;But [Ryan] doesn’t think the behavior of the snails, or the cells, proves  that RNA is transferring memories. He said he doesn’t understand how  RNA, which works on a time scale of minutes to hours, could be causing  memory recall that is almost instantaneous, or how RNA could connect  numerous parts of the brain, like the auditory and visual systems, that  are involved in more complex memories. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But I haven't won the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kavli.columbia.edu/leadership/kandel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Eric Kandel&quot;&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt;, so what do I know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abramson CI, Chicas-Mosier AM.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Ion channels can either be modelled at a macroscopic level, using a deterministic representation such as the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, or at a more detailed single-channel level, where their stochastic nature is taken into account by using a Markov formalism. The Hodgkin-Huxley model describes the combined collective effect of the channel population on the membrane potential, but it does not provide a comprehensive kinetic diagram. As a result, various aspects of the behaviour and consequently the functional role of individual channels can be overlooked. On the other hand, a more accurate alternative channel formalism is the Markov model. In Markov models, a single channel is represented by a kinetic scheme comprising a finite set of discrete intermediate states with probabilistic transitions from one state to another. Channel noise, introduced by the stochastic gating of the ion channels, can affect the generation and timing of action potentials and therefore potentially also single neuron computations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present study, the voltage-gated channels of a morphologically realistic conductance based cerebellar nucleus (CN) neuron model were expressed as Markov formalisms and their behaviour was compared with their deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley type counterparts. Our results show that the majority of the deterministic CN channel models could easily be replaced by stochastic versions, without affecting neuronal behaviour. However, this was not the case for the fast sodium channel, where the parameter changes that had to be introduced in order to match the activity of the stochastic and deterministic models depended on the level of activation of the neuron, even for very small single channel conductances in the stochastic model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When, in Shakespeare’s &lt;i&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/i&gt;, Marc Anthony delivers his funeral oration for his fallen friend, he famously says “The evil that men do lives on; the good is oft interred with their bones.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony was talking about how history would remember Caesar, lamenting that doing evil confers greater historical immortality than doing good. But what about &lt;i&gt;literal&lt;/i&gt; immortality?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there’s no room for such a notion in the scientific worldview, belief in an immortal afterlife was common throughout history and continues to this day across many cultures. Formal, codified belief systems like Christianity have a lot to say about the afterlife, including how earthly behaviour determines our eternal fate: the virtuous among us will apparently spend the rest of our spiritual days in paradise, while the wicked are condemned to suffer until the end of time. Yet, according to Christianity and many other formal religions, there’s no suggestion that anyone – good, bad or indifferent – gets more or less immortality, which is taken to be an all-or-nothing affair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not how ordinary people think intuitively about immortality, though. In a series of seven studies &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167217754068&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Kurt Gray at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and colleagues, have found that, whether religious or not, people tend to think that those who do good or evil in their earthly lives achieve greater immortality than those who lead more morally neutral lives. What’s more, the virtuous and the wicked are seen to achieve different kinds of immortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33929&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings complement previous work showing how we see moral character as a defining feature of people, both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027713002497&quot;&gt;when they’re alive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17156519&quot;&gt;when their souls depart&lt;/a&gt;. In the new studies, Gray and colleagues extended this, finding that their participants (recruited online via Amazon Mechanical Turk and including atheists and people of different religious faiths), rated historical figures who were extremely good or bad – Martin Luther King or Hitler, for example – as achieving a greater degree of immortality than morally neutral figures, such as Ameila Earhart and Andy Warhol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if both good and evil people are seen to achieve greater immortality than the more morally neutral, might they nonetheless experience different kinds of immortality? For many of the world’s major religions, the answer is clearly yes: perform morally positive acts on earth and you go to The Good Place (Heaven) to enjoy total freedom in a paradisiacal realm, but do evil and you go instead to The Bad Place (Hell) to be tormented for all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casting a wider anthropological net, many smaller, less formal belief systems also posit that good and evil spirits experience immorality in different ways. In particular, it’s common to find the belief that while virtuous spirits enjoy a transcendental freedom, evil spirits are more likely to be trapped or confined in some way, such as the Iroquois belief that they are eternally confined to their homes. Similar ideas crop up in popular culture too. When the evil wizard Voldemort dies in &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/i&gt;, his soul lives on in magical objects called Horcruxes. But when Obi-Wan Kenobi dies in the &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; films, his spirit is able to roam freely through the ethereal realm of the Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gray and his colleagues found their participants held similar intuitive beliefs about the fates of deceased good, bad or neutral historical figures: they were more likely to see good souls as living in a transcendent state, wicked souls as trapped, and neutral souls as slightly less free than good ones but freer than bad ones.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reverse inference also held: reading about someone who had recently died and whose spirit had left the earthly realm and moved beyond space and time prompted participants to infer that this must have been a good person, while the converse led them to think the person must have been bad.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, participants inferred that spirits inhabiting expansive locations, like hot deserts , arctic tundra or mountaintops, were more benevolent than those living in more confined locations, like a narrow trench,underground cave or tent in the woods, irrespective of how pleasant those locations were deemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such inferences might explain why paranormal events are typically chalked up to malevolent spirits. The researchers asked more participants to imagine being in the house of someone recently deceased and that they felt a strange sensation as their spirit passed by. After reading these stories, people tended to view this spirit as malevolent, as a trapped spirit must be a bad spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In explaining their findings, Gray’s team suggest that seeing good souls as free and transcendent and bad ones as confined and trapped stems in part for a basic desire for justice, with bad souls ending up in a spiritual prison and less able to roam and harm others. Such a desire may also receive a cognitive boost from the fact that notions of good and evil are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11301525&quot;&gt;metaphorically&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1502279&quot;&gt;associated&lt;/a&gt; with ideas of lightness and airiness, and darkness and constriction, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results did not appear to depend on whether participants already held religious beliefs about the afterlife – the same patterns were found regardless of their stated faith or supernatural belief, suggesting that our folk intuitions about immortality tend to overpower any formal belief systems that we claim to subscribe to. “These ways of thinking are very intuitive, and overcoming them takes effort,” says Gray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One caveat to these studies concerns the fact that the participants were from a Western, educated, industrialised, rich, democratic (WEIRD) society. Psychological insights generated from WEIRD participants do not always generalize to other cultures, and in this case beliefs about reincarnation may have been under-represented. But Gray and colleagues argue that the cross-cultural similarities in the beliefs about the afterlife that inspired the research suggest that the new studies tap into a universal aspect of our psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gray is currently writing up the results of follow-on studies in which he looked at how the state of someone’s mind at the point of death – say, whether it was at the peak of health or wracked by dementia – affected how participants perceived its prospects for immortality. So while we may not ever be able to achieve literal immortality, at least we may soon know what it takes for others to &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; we’re immortal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;—&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167217754068&quot;&gt;To be immortal, do good or evil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
