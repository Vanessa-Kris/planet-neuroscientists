&lt;p&gt;The learning-by-teaching effect has been demonstrated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/00028312019002237&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X13000209&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;. Students who spend time teaching what they’ve learned go on to show better understanding and knowledge retention than students who simply spend the same time re-studying. What remains unresolved, however, is exactly why teaching helps the teacher better understand and retain what they’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acp.3410?campaign=wolearlyview&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Applied Cognitive Psychology&lt;/i&gt; researchers led by Aloysius Wei Lun Koh set out to test their theory that teaching improves the teacher’s learning because it compels the teacher to retrieve what they’ve previously studied. In other words, they believe the learning benefit of teaching is simply another manifestation of the well-known “testing effect” – the way that bringing to mind what we’ve previously studied leads to deeper and longer-lasting acquisition of that information than more time spent passively re-studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33821&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 124 students and asked them spend ten minutes studying a text, with accompanying figures, about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect&quot;&gt;Doppler Effect&lt;/a&gt; and soundwaves – a topic about which none of them had any previous knowledge – with a view to teaching the material themselves afterwards without notes. Participants were told they could take notes while studying but not keep them for the next stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the study phase, the participants were divided into four groups. In one group participants spent five minutes being filmed alone while they stood and delivered a lesson on the study material without notes (they could use a blank flip chart to draw figures if they wanted). The other groups either spent the same time completing multiplication arithmetic; standing up and teaching verbatim from a set script (including making reference to pre-drawn figures on a white board); or writing down all they could remember from the text (i.e. a form of retrieval practice designed to induce the testing effect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later, all the participants returned to the lab for a surprise test of their knowledge and comprehension of the original study text in the form of six free-response questions that required them to explain key concepts from the study materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical finding is that the teaching-without-notes group outperformed the group that had spent the same time completing arithmetic problems and the group that had taught from a script, but so too did the group who simply spent the same time retrieving what they’d learned. In fact, the final comprehension performance of the teaching-without-notes group and the retrieval-practice group was comparable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said their results suggest that “the benefits of the learning-by-teaching strategy are attributable to retrieval practice; that is, the robust learning-by-teaching strategy works but only when the teaching involves &lt;i&gt;retrieving&lt;/i&gt; the taught materials.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings don’t undermine the notion of teaching as an effect learning method, but they have practical implications for how the learning-by-teaching approach is applied in education and training. “In order to insure that students and tutors learn and retain the educational material that they have prepared and presented in class, they ought to internalize the to-be-presented material prior to communicating it to an audience, rather than rely on study notes during the presentation process”, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critical readers may take issue with the lack of realism in the study – there was no audience of learners in either of the teaching conditions and therefore no interaction, which surely also plays a part in the learning benefits of teaching. Also, participants in all groups were originally primed to expect to have to teach the material, which may have had learning benefits in itself – perhaps the retrieval group would not have matched the comprehension of the teaching-without-notes group without being primed in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lun Koh and colleagues acknowledged some of these issues and they called on further research to “assess the importance of retrieval practice across a variety of teaching scenarios and activities.”&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Creativity research has come of age. Today, the nature of the creative process is investigated with every tool of modern cognitive neuroscience: neuroimaging, genetics, computational modeling, among them. Yet the brain mechanisms of creativity remain a mystery and the studies of the brains of “creative” individuals have so far failed to produce conclusive results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the mystery is gradually yielding ground. As we are reconceptualizing creativity as a complex, and arguably derivative construct consisting of many moving parts, we are beginning to study these moving parts in a systematic way. The old tabloid clichés linking creativity to specific brain structures are no longer tenable, but they do seem to have captured some important aspects of the underlying neurobiological processes. We no longer believe that creativity “resides” in the right hemisphere, but evidence is growing that the right hemisphere is particularly adept at dealing with novelty, an important ingredient of any creative process. In contrast, the left hemisphere appears to be the repository of well-entrenched knowledge and skills, verbal and non-verbal alike, which is an equally important prerequisite of a creative process (remember the giants on whose shoulders we all stand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a radical departure from the old notion linking the left hemisphere to language and right hemisphere to non-verbal visuo-spatial processes, and it elucidates the complementary roles of the two cerebral hemispheres in the creative process. Furthermore, the complementary roles of the two hemispheres in supporting novelty vs well-routinized cognitive skills appears to be present across a wide range of species, not just primates, but other mammalians. They are present even in species whose brains are devoid of developed cortex and rely instead on the phylogenetically ancient principle consisting of relatively “modular” nuclei, such as birds (and by extension probably in dinosaurs). Such evolutionary continuities open the door for the studies of the evolutionary precursors for forebears of human creativity. Likewise, it is no longer tenable to view the frontal lobes as the “seat” of creativity, but evidence is growing in linking the frontal lobes to processing cognitive novelty. The frontal lobes, or, more precisely, the prefrontal cortex, is also critical for salience judgment, the ability to decide what is important and what is not. This ability is essential for the creative process, lest the creative mind strays into innovative but inconsequential esoterica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer believe that creativity “resides” in the right hemisphere, but evidence is growing that the right hemisphere is particularly adept at dealing with novelty, an important ingredient of any creative process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But understanding the workings of the mind behind the innovation is only part of the challenge facing creativity research. In a society infused with innovation at an increasingly accelerating rate, understanding its impact on the consumer becomes particularly important. In the not-so-distant past, a human being could acquire a repertoire of knowledge and skills in one’s youth and coast on that knowledge for the rest of one’s life. This was true even for professionals engaged in seemingly daunting intellectual activities. In reality, however, a physician or an engineer could operate throughout much of their professional career on a “mental autopilot,” without much need to update their professional knowledge or skills. This was even more the case for a person’s ability to navigate daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today new technologies and knowledge saturate society at such a rate&lt;del&gt;,&lt;/del&gt; that even the laziest and least intellectually inclined among us are forced to absorb innovation all the time, whether we like it or not, both in our professional activities and in everyday life. The ever-accelerating rate of innovation places unprecedented demands on its consumer and makes the consumer a real partner in the process to a degree unprecedented in the history of our species. When you see an octogenarian using an iPhone or an iPad, you can safely assume that she did not grow up with either of these hi-tech devices, that nothing in her early background prepared her for the flood of new electronic technologies, yet here she is, operating them confidently and competently. How does the human brain function in this new environment? How does it develop and how does it age? How do these radical changes in the degree of novelty exposure change the nature of psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as dementia?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in our increasingly technological world, the question of Artificially Intelligent (AI) creativity inevitably arises. Offensive as this may sound to the more exceptionalism-mined members of our own species, if creativity is defined as a conjunction of novelty and societal relevance, then the authorship of the creative process should not be part of its definition. Until now, AI has focused on the design of dedicated devices each adept at performing a pre-specified, relatively narrow class of task. But more recently the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) movement is gathering speed with an audacious goal of designing artificial devices capable of open-ended learning and yes, creative processes. Today, AI-generated art, both paintings and music, has been judged by human connoisseurs as “creative.” How we, the biological humans, will fit into this brave new world and how we’ll be changed by it, is yet another question for future creativity research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Christian Jarrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In research published in the 1990s, psychologists asked people to list their biggest regrets in life and found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1995-05382-001&quot;&gt;they tended to mention things they hadn’t done, rather than things they had&lt;/a&gt;.  Now, one of the psychologists behind that seminal research – Thomas Gilovich at Cornell University – together with his colleague Shai Davidai at The New School for Social Research – have looked into the content of people’s regrets, as opposed to how they were brought about (by action or inaction). Across six studies, the pair present new evidence, &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-21180-001&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that our most enduring regrets concern not living up to our ideal selves (i.e. not becoming the person we wanted to be), as opposed to not living according to our “ought selves” (the person we should have been based on our duties and responsibilities).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33818&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers surveyed hundreds of participants, including students, but mostly members of the public recruited on Amazon’s survey website. For most of the studies, the researchers started out telling their recruits the difference between regrets concerning the “ideal self” (not achieving goals they had set for themselves, their dreams and ambitions) and “the ought self” (not meeting the norms and rules they had for themselves or fulfilling their obligations to others), before asking them to list, name and categorise their regrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the different studies, the participants said they experienced regrets concerning their ideal self more often (72 per cent vs. 28 per cent); they mentioned more ideal-self regrets than ought-self regrets when asked to list their regrets in life so far (57 per cent vs. 43 per cent); and when asked to name their single biggest regret in life, participants were more likely to mention a regret about not fulfilling their ideal self (76 per cent vs. 24 per cent mentioning an ought-self regret).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilovich and Davidai next tested their belief that a key reason why ideal-self regrets are more enduring is that we are less likely to take practical and psychological action at the time to repair these regrets, compared with ought-self regrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, presented with hypothetical ideal-self regrets (such as forsaken dreams or romantic interests not pursued) and hypothetical ought-self regrets (like failing to visit a dying relative or infidelity), participants said a typical person was more likely to take action, psychological and practical, to repair the ought-self regrets, such as by finding a silver lining or doing something to dampen the regret, than to repair ideal-self regrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up study, participants described actual regrets they had, either ideal-self related or ought-self related, and said what they’d done to cope with them. Those asked to describe ought-self regrets rated them as having been more urgent and said they’d taken more steps to cope, including changing their behaviour, rectifying the situation or undoing it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the researchers switched things up and asked 157 more participants to recall a resolved regret or an unresolved regret (“unfinished business”) – they found those asked to write about the former were more likely to describe an ought-self regret, while those asked to write about the latter were more likely to describe an ideal-self regret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilovich and Davidai and are not saying that the only reason that ideal-self regrets are more enduring is because we are less likely to attend to them and resolve them, but they think this is a key factor in why they are generally more bothersome and come more readily to mind. Other possible reasons (not tested in the current research) are that our ideal selves are simply less obtainable than our ought selves, more abstract, and less context dependent, meaning regrets pertaining to them are triggered more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our work is the first to show that people’s most prominent life regrets more often involve failures to live up to their ideal self than their ought self,” the researchers concluded. And they added the work “… is the first to document the role played by behavioural and psychological coping mechanisms in people’s tendency to regret their failures to live up to their ideal selves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new results are backed up by anecdotal accounts from patients nearing the end of their lives, described &lt;a href=&quot;https://bronnieware.com/regrets-of-the-dying/&quot;&gt;in a book&lt;/a&gt; by palliative nurse Bronnie Ware in 2013: “When people realise that their life is almost over and look back clearly on it, it is easy to see how many dreams have gone unfulfilled,” she wrote. “Most people had not honoured even a half of their dreams and had to die knowing that it was due to choices that they had made, or not made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we take any practical insights from the latest findings? Gilovich and Davidai urge caution, suggesting that the most advisable way to live will depend on how much weight you place on your ought self vs. your ideal self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you place a premium on your ought self, you “would be wise to minimise [your] regrets by thinking twice before forging ahead [and seizing the moment]” they suggest. On the other hand, “if one is an adventurous soul guided by her ideal self, she might indeed end up happier by seizing the day and not looking back. As we have shown in this research, a person focused on her ideal self is more likely to lose sleep over her ‘wouldas’ and ‘couldas’ than her ‘shouldas’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-21180-001&quot;&gt;The ideal road not taken: The self-discrepancies involved in people’s most enduring regrets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That study provided the earliest evidence for a controversial hypothesis, the Behavioural Ecology View (BECV) of facial displays, outlined in detail in a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/references/S1364-6613(18)30029-9&quot;&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Trends in Cognitive Sciences&lt;/i&gt;. Carlos Crivelli at De Montfort University, Leicester, UK and Alan Fridlund at the University of California, Santa Barbara, put forward the case that facial displays are not universal, “pre-wired” expressions of emotion – a concept supported by 80 per cent of emotion researchers in a recent poll – but are flexible tools for influencing the behaviour of other people.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33793&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same range of specific facial displays have been associated with anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness and surprise in many different cultures. As Paul Ekman at the University of California, San Francisco – the best-known proponent of the “basic emotions theory” or BET – writes in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paulekman.com/uncategorized/darwins-claim-universals-facial-expression-challenged/&quot;&gt;blog post:&lt;/a&gt; “The capacity for humans in radically different cultures to label facial expressions with terms from a list of emotion terms has replicated nearly 200 hundred times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Crivelli and Fridlund write in their paper: “Despite its popularity, the assumptions and prescriptions of BET are meeting unprecedented challenges.” They argue that there are “serious methodological problems” in the initial studies on indigenous societies, and point to “countervailing” data from more recent studies, also conducted on small-scale indigenous societies, one Melanesian (the Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea) and two African (the Himba of Namibia and the Mwani of Mozambique).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data gathered in the past five years from these societies are “inconsistent with the universality thesis”, the pair write. For instance, when Trobrianders are presented with the “gasping face”, which is usually taken as expressing fear, they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27791137?dopt=Abstract&quot;&gt;perceive it as a “threatening” face&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the BET, this is an example of an unusual local cultural influence. But Crivelli and Fridlund aren’t convinced. They point to data showing that the gasping face is used as a threat display also in several African, Amazonian and Pacific small-scale indigenous societies.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mismatches on the original face studies were always attributed to thin, cultural rule-governed overlays,” they write. But, they argue “Those deviations, just like the new evidence found in African and Melanesian populations may indicate &lt;i&gt;fundamental&lt;/i&gt; [my italics] human diversity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true that people from many different countries associate smiles with happiness (the Trobrianders are, in fact, a notable exception), but this has more to do with convergent genetic and cultural evolution, Crivelli and Fridlund argue, than to do with smiles being some kind of involuntary, hard-wired read-out of positive emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does what we know about babies’ facial displays and emotions feed into this debate? Babies often smile when they see a family member or pet. They wrinkle their nose and protrude their tongue when given food they don’t like. Their eyes open wide at loud noises. And their mouths turn down when they cry. But according to BECV, this doesn’t necessarily mean that these are expressions of the emotions of happiness, disgust, fear or sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the BECV, which holds that these displays have not evolved to provide a fixed read-out of internal states but rather to influence the behaviour of other people, common facial displays are seen as having the following communicative functions – in adults, as well (the more traditional BET interpretation of the corresponding felt emotion is in brackets):&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smile – (Happiness) – Influence interactant to play or affiliate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pouting – (Sadness) – Recruit interactant’s succour or protection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scowling – (Anger) – Influence interactant to submit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gasping – (Fear) – Deflect interactant’s attack via one’s own submission or incipient retreat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nose scrunching – (Disgust) – Reject current interaction trajectory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neutral – (“Suppressed emotion” or no emotion) – Lead the interactant nowhere in interaction trajectory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may well be that when we’re in a positive mood state, we’re more open to interacting and affiliating with others – and more likely to smile. But we all sometimes – or even often – smile when we’re not &lt;i&gt;feeling&lt;/i&gt; happy. According to the BET, these are insincere smiles. But if the purpose of a smile is to encourage other people to interact and affiliate (when meeting new people for the first time, say, or walking into an important meeting), they aren’t insincere at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their paper, Fridlund and Crivelli also point to a re-conceiving of animal facial (and postural) displays as an “ecology of signalling”, based on the interests of the displayers and the receivers, who all have their own histories of interaction and who must negotiate for advantages within their group and their environment. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some research (such as the bowling study) that finds we are more likely to use facial displays – or that the displays are more pronounced – when we’re with other people. But one criticism of the BECV approach is that we do smile, grimace and frown when we are alone. Crivelli and Fridlund argue that while we may be alone physically we are never “psychologically alone”. “Our cast of interactants may include fantasised humans, real non-humans, humans who are not proximal, or any nearby objects”, they write.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this won’t be the BECV argument that doubters will find hardest to accept. BECV will always be a tough sell, Crivelli and Fridlund note, in part because it’s more demanding to investigate experimentally than BET, and also, they argue, because “BECV requires shaking off a romanticised view of human nature…that makes the face a battleground between an interior ‘authentic self’ and an external, impression-managed ‘social self’…Within BECV both ‘selves’ are illusory. We are unified organisms, and like our words, voices and gestures, our facial displays are part of our plans of action in social commerce.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it isn’t only the BET itself that BECV challenges. What about the body of work on the role of facial displays in triggering emotion contagion? Or in empathy, for that matter.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; The BECV is fascinating&lt;/span&gt;. But to call it “controversial” is probably an understatement.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Mindfulness Mediation&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/Mindfullness-Meditation-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is fair to say that mindfulness meditation has become a mainstream technique in the toolkit of psychologists and others working in various settings across the world. It has made its way from clinical environments, such as the hospital or therapy room, to our schools, our workplaces and our universities. But what evidence is there for its usefulness in these different contexts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving away from clinical environments has meant moving away from a reliance on clinical effects to justify the implementation of mindfulness meditation interventions. Now, mindfulness meditation is not only linked to decreased stress and relapse of mood disorders, it is also claimed that mindfulness meditation results in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14681994.2012.748889&quot;&gt;better relationships&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/523f28fce4b0f99c83f055f2/t/52d92a65e4b04d4af95709ed/1389963877991/VanDoesumVanLangeJPSP2013.pdf&quot;&gt;more prosocial behaviour&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-34922-001&quot;&gt;higher job satisfaction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027273581000173X&quot;&gt;more focused attention, greater memory skills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://prsinstitute.org/downloads/related/spiritual-sciences/meditation/TowardtheIntegrationofMeditationintoHigherEducation.pdf&quot;&gt;improved critical thinking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, how strong is the evidence for these claims? Take the research on relationships and pro-social behaviour – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20299-z&quot;&gt;a recent meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated that evidence for these benefits falls away when studies use stronger methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindfulness meditation and cognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the other claims regarding the benefits of mindfulness meditation relate to cognitive ability. These claims can be divided into those pertaining to lower-order cognitive functions, such as perception, attention and automatic responses (as Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman would say, thinking fast), and higher-order thinking skills such as problem-solving, decision-making and, in general, critical thinking (or thinking slow).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since mindfulness, as it is taught in Western psychology, relies heavily on cultivating acceptance, it may have a negative effect on the tendency to think critically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were particularly interested in the claims that mindfulness may benefit critical thinking for two reasons. One, critical thinking is a hugely important set of skills to cultivate in society so it is important that we understand whether interventions aimed at improving critical thinking work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, there is a potential paradox within the claim that mindfulness may facilitate critical thinking. Since mindfulness, as it is taught in Western psychology, relies heavily on cultivating acceptance, it may have a negative effect on the tendency to think critically. Critical thinking fundamentally requires &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;accepting information without questioning it. Interestingly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.02043/full&quot;&gt;a cross-sectional study&lt;/a&gt; we conducted showed both positive and negative effects of the tendency to be mindful on performance in a critical thinking task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We followed this up with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-017-0789-8&quot;&gt;lab-based experiment&lt;/a&gt; on the effects of a single guided mindfulness meditation in comparison to a guided sham meditation – something that sounded like mindfulness meditation but without the specific instructions on how to control your attention. In this experiment, there was no overall benefit of being randomised to the mindfulness meditation group. However, those in the mindfulness meditation group who were less disposed towards putting effort into critical thinking and those who were less open-minded did experience some improvement in critical thinking performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing effectiveness of mindfulness meditation on cognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-018-0226-3?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Psychology-Psychiatry/Psychology-Global&amp;amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_MAY2018_Mindfullness&quot;&gt;Our latest paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describes the strongest test of claims regarding mindfulness and critical thinking thus far. Across 6 weeks, we tested t&lt;img alt=&quot;College student&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10118 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/College-student-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;he effects of regular mindfulness meditation against the effects of engaging in a sham meditation – listening to a recording which was ostensibly a guided mindfulness meditation – among a sample of university students. We focused on students not just out of convenience but also because a report on the integration of meditation practices in to higher education had suggested doing so would improve critical thinking among students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ninety students were randomly assigned to either the mindfulness meditation group or the sham meditation group. Importantly, neither the students nor the researchers were aware of which group the participants were in, and the participants were under the impression that both conditions involved equally effective meditation techniques.&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt; In other words, the study was a randomised controlled trial with a double blind methodology which was also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-016-0122-7&quot;&gt;pre-registered&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to achieve this rigour by partnering with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.headspace.com/&quot;&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt;, a company which produces the world’s most popular mindfulness mediation app. This allowed us to collect objective adherence data and meant that our method of delivering the guided meditations was ecologically valid, since apps are one of the most popular ways of learning to meditate. We even got Andy Puddicombe, co-founder of Headspace, to record our sham meditation script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allowed us to collect objective adherence data and meant that our method of delivering the guided meditations was ecologically valid, since apps are one of the most popular ways of learning to meditate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome measures of primary interest in this study were mindfulness, executive functioning, critical thinking and two dispositions towards critical thinking – actively open-minded thinking and need for cognition. According to theories in cognitive psychology which focus on fast and slow thinking, known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dual-process-theory-Evans_Stanovich_PoPS13.pdf&quot;&gt;dual process theories&lt;/a&gt;, executive function is the mechanism through which responses generated through fast thinking are inhibited which allows slow thinking, such as critical thinking, to occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results did not support the claim that regular mindfulness meditation practice improves critical thinking. We found that both mindfulness meditation and sham meditation resulted in equal improvements in critical thinking over the course of the stud&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;y. Therefore, there was no effect specific to the practice of mindfulness meditation. We believe that there are a number of possible explanations for this finding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results did not support the claim that regular mindfulness meditation practice improves critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely that the improvement in both groups can be attributed to a mixture of demand characteristics (i.e. participants changing their responses in line with what they expect the study results to be) and a placebo effect. In relation to the mindfulness outcome measure, it is also possible that the mindfulness questionnaire we used is not sensitive enough to detect changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psychometric properties of this and many other mindfulness questionnaires are questionable and it is probable that the best we can hope to measure with such questionnaires is “perceived mindfulness”. In general, there is a great need for improvement in the methodological quality of mindfulness research, particularly in terms of measurement and experimental control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;In summary, th&lt;/span&gt;ere have been many unsupported and unchallenged claims regarding the supposed benefits of mindfulness practice, as it is taught in Western psychology, and a big industry has been built on the shaky foundation of these claims. We have demonstrated that it is possible to identify these claims and apply rigorous research methods to determine whether they are supported or not. Mindfulness research must continue to use randomized control trials, double blinding, and objective measurements of adherence and outcomes of the intervention for claims regarding mindfulness practice to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/04/Power-to-the-Preprint_blog-image-002-150x150.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preprints are here!!! Starting today authors submitting their manuscript to most PLOS journals* can also choose to post their article on bioRxiv, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory’s preprint server for the life sciences. This is an important development for both PLOS, for bioRxiv, for the authors we serve, and for the life sciences. For PLOS, it enables us to achieve a long-standing aspect of our vision to make research more quickly available to enable discovery and reuse.  For bioRxiv, this development will augment the server’s already rapidly climbing manuscript submission rate. And authors will gain the opportunity of sharing their work before peer review on a trusted platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Collaborating with bioRxiv is part of a much bigger strategy for PLOS moving forward, one in which we’ll renew our roots of being a catalytic open publisher” said Alison Mudditt, CEO of PLOS. “To accelerate innovation, we’ll often act in partnership with others in the community, which will move us closer to our vision of how scientific communication should work.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We warmly welcome the further integration of PLOS journals with bioRxiv,” said John Inglis, co-founder of bioRxiv. “The server’s goal is the acceleration of research and providing unrestricted access to manuscripts before they enter an often lengthy process of peer review is one of several ways bioRxiv is delivering on its promise.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what are preprints exactly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A preprint is an openly available scientific manuscript that an author uploads to a public server like bioRxiv prior to peer review. The preprint contains data and methodologies and is typically the same manuscript that is submitted to a journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why are preprints important?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for starters, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/04/one-small-step-for-preprints-one-giant-step-forward-for-open-scientific-communications/&quot;&gt;early sharing&lt;/a&gt; of ideas can lead to new discoveries and collaboration, and early feedback can help improve your manuscript. We are committed to putting your science first. By allowing a submission to be posted on bioRxiv, authors accelerate the dissemination of their work and invite commentary by a broader community, which PLOS editors may evaluate as part of peer review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will it work?&lt;/strong&gt; This graphic is a visual representation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/04/Snip-4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8201&quot; height=&quot;652&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/04/Snip-4.png&quot; width=&quot;1098&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, PLOS will perform initial manuscript screening compatible with bioRxiv standards, covering appropriate scope and article type, plagiarism detection, and other basic ethical and technical criteria. Articles will then post to the bioRxiv server and be freely accessible online. Authors must choose to opt-in to this preprint process when they submit papers to PLOS.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h4&gt;And the hunt for its neural causes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8atjnMgv1YE7waQcX5HYaA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Neural detectives. Credit: Pixabay/www_sion_pics&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all started with ketamine. To some, vets mainly, it’s a horse tranquilliser. To others, a party drug. To those with severe clinical depression, a potential, literal, life-saver. A dose of ketamine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/03/depression-medication-fda-psychadelics-ketamine-psilocybin-johnson-and-johnson-mdma&quot;&gt;can rapidly dull&lt;/a&gt; the symptoms of depression, providing immediate relief for those crippled by the darkest thoughts. And while ketamine does not work for everyone, it seems to work in many people who are untouched by standard anti-depressant drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketamine could then be our best lead in the hunt for depression. For if we search for where ketamine affects the brain, and for how it affects the brain, we will get vital clues to the cause of depression. And so to a long-lasting effective treatment. Two studies just published in &lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;used precisely this trick, and spectacularly uncovered not just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25509&quot;&gt;compelling evidence&lt;/a&gt; of the tiny brain region to target, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25752&quot;&gt;exactly what goes wrong&lt;/a&gt; in it to create depression — that some neurons are, literally, depressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hunt for depression is a tricky case for any neural detective. Your brain has 86 billion neurons. Where to start looking for suspects? Well, let’s think about that for a second. We want somewhere in the brain that can control how you feel things are going — that things are sometimes better than expected, and worth enjoying. And somewhere in the brain that has something to do with serotonin, because the long-standing treatment for clinical depression are “SSRIs”, drugs that make more serotonin available by stopping it from being mopped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter the lateral habenula. Rolls off the tongue, doesn’t it? But it fits the suspect’s profile. It connects to both serotonin and dopamine releasing neurons. When dopamine neurons burst with activity, that’s a signal we just got something better than expected (serotonin neurons might &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/06346&quot;&gt;signal a similar thing&lt;/a&gt;). And when the lateral habenula releases a burst of activity, it stops the dopamine and serotonin neurons from bursting. Stops them from telling the brain — hey, that was unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, usually, this is for the common good. The lateral habenula sends the signal that what just happened was, in fact, expected. So you, little dopamine neuron, and you, precious serotonin neuron, do not need to burst — everything is as it is should be. With this signal from the habenula, your brain knows the world is predictable, and can go about its business; if every little thing was signalled as being surprising, you’d spend all day giggling and kicking things to see what they did. You’d be a three year old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when we look in the brains of depressed mice, we see their lateral habenula is bursting more than usual. Much more. The “nothing surprising” signal is being sent far too much, and at the wrong time. The dopamine and serotonin neurons cannot frolic and play. The brain is robbed of some key signals that life is worth pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We suspect the lateral habenula based on this strong circumstantial evidence, that it connects to the right things and its signals go haywire in depressed mice. Now to get a conviction we need more than circumstantial evidence. We need probable cause: does ketamine stop the bursting and remove depression? And we need motive: what drives the habenula to increase its bursting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two studies in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; from Hailan Hu and team answered both questions. Let’s start, as they did, with probable cause: if we stick ketamine into the habenula, does it alleviate depression? Yes. Depressed rats recover. In a bunch of tests, injecting ketamine into the habenula restores a rat’s élan: exploring, reacting, enjoying the taste of sweet sweet sucrose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(And this is true in a type of depressed mouse too. No one believes for a second that rats or mice experience the range of difficult and terrible thoughts accompanying clinical depression in people. So finding a common effect across quite different species of rodent, each type replicating different aspects of the human disorder, is key to believing that all this work has something to do with depression.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right, so ketamine can work its magic from within the habenula. But we want evidence that it has any effect on the habenula itself. For, surely, if that over-active bursting of the habenula in some way causes depression then ketamine should clobber the bursts? Remarkably, it does. Ketamine reduces the number of bursting neurons, right down to the same number found in healthy brains. We now have a big wodge of evidence for a probable cause of depression: habenula neurons burst fire when they should not, and stopping this bursting with ketamine stops depression (in tiny rodents).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better, because we know how ketamine attaches itself to a neuron (to NMDA receptors, if you like such things), Hu’s team could work out which specific hole in the neuron’s skin was being opened to cause the bursting. Ketamine stopped the hole from opening. Which means we now have a specific target to build anti-depressant drugs for: to stop this hole, this channel, from opening too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah, but we can do even better than that. Hu and team then went after the motive, asking why the habenula neurons were bursting too much in the first place. Why is this channel open when it should not be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first clue was in an odd property of the neurons that burst in the habenula. When doing nothing at all, these neurons were more depressed than the others. Neurons at rest have a characteristic, tiny voltage, a voltage created by the difference between how many ions are in them and how many are outside them. The habenula’s bursting neurons had a lower voltage when resting than the others. And this lower voltage means the channel that makes bursts is primed, ready to open; when the voltage is higher, the channel is turned off. Guess what? In depressed rats, there are more depressed neurons in the habenlua. Ergo, there are too many neurons ready to burst without provocation, at the wrong time, and in the wrong place.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Almost there, we almost have the motive. What then caused there to be too many depressed neurons? Well, whatever controls the difference between ions inside and outside a neuron. And that turned out to be the other cells in the brain, the ones that aren’t neurons. The unsung below-stairs staff that tidy up the mess, fix the broken crockery, and keep the food and drink flowing. The glia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hu’s team found that wrapped around each habenula neuron is a special glia cell. That glia cell’s job is to clear potassium away from around the neuron. (Potassium being one of the key ions that makes neurons work properly — eat bananas, people.) In depressed mice, that glia cell was too good at its job. It mopped up way more potassium than it should (if you care about these things, it over-expressed the KIR4.1 channel. Happy now?). And what does less potassium outside the neuron mean? Yep: the neuron has a lower voltage at rest. The motive is clear: an overly-enthusiastic glia cell is sweeping away far more potassium than it should, making its neuron neighbour depressed, so depressed it bursts when it should not; and this bursting is, it seems, a cause of what we call depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is this knowledge even better? Ah, because now we can search for drugs to target the specific mechanism that goes wrong, in those specific types of glia cells, drugs that aim to rebalance potassium around those neurons. Indeed, Hu and team used genetic tricks to bodge or block the glia cell’s mechanism in their mice, and voila! Bursting returned to normal and the mice recovered their elan. And having such a specific drug target is fantastic, as the more precise the tool for the job, the easier it is to avoid unpleasant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caveat emptor. Let’s list all the things that get in the way of this being the best thing since Pop Tarts. For a start, these are rats and mice. It is notoriously tricky to translate findings in rodents into something that works in humans. Very few drugs that work in rodents become successful drugs in humans. The endless failures of clinical trials for Alzheimer’s is proof enough of that. Another blip is that there is evidently a whole other story to play out, of how these glia go wrong in the first place — and how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2018/jan/08/is-everything-johann-hari-knows-about-depression-wrong-lost-connections&quot;&gt;the well-documented roles&lt;/a&gt; of stress, life-events, and predisposing genes all contribute. On top of that, ketamine does not work in all people; so this cannot be the cause of depression&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it seems unlikely that there is one single cause. And the fact ketamine works is hopeful. Hu and team have found wonderfully specific targets to test. If this does not turn out to be a major part of the solution to clinical depression, it gives many ideas of what could be the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very little of this work would have been possible without basic science, without science that is not driven by immediate goals of studying disease. Take for example the clues that the lateral habenula could be important. These come from people studying how the brain learns. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/s/theories-of-mind/did-i-do-that-636a7f2b0520&quot;&gt;well developed theory&lt;/a&gt; for how the firing of dopamine neurons controls learning. This theory prompted major efforts to understand: well, what controls the firing of dopamine neurons? And here was unearthed the lateral habenula, an obscure part of the brain of late, languishing unloved, now risen to prominence. And a few more examples of the contributions of basic science for good measure: the tests of the rats’ behaviour to work out how depressed they were; or how to record the bursting in neurons; or how to test the channel that causes the bursting. All these, and more, come from people driven by curiosity, not by being told to work on a specific disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For we can never know what will be key to unlocking the mystery of a brain disorder. But as Hu and team dramatically demonstrated, when we get a sniff of a clue, we can grab all our accumulated scientific know-how, tricks, and tools and use them to turn one small clue into a sprawling case for the prosecution. The game is afoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want more?

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Are you spending more and more time consuming social media through your computer, mobile phone, video games, and social media apps? If so, you’re not alone. Data from &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/social-media/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt; has shown that use of social media among adults has grown from 5% in 2005 to 69% in 2018, with almost 90% of 18–29-years-olds indicating use. Using social media of various forms &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/10/19/peds.2016-2592&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;may have some benefits&lt;/a&gt;; in addition to entertainment value, social media can also expose us to new ideas and current events, promote community participation, facilitate connection with long-distance friends and family, and enhance access to social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, social media use can have negative health-related consequences as well. Using social media has been associated with &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40675-015-0023-y&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;important sleep-related outcomes&lt;/a&gt; such as a shorter number of hours slept at night and poorer sleep quality. This is noteworthy because the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://sleepfoundation.org/sites/default/files/bedroompoll/NSF_Bedroom_Poll_Report.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Sleep Foundation&lt;/a&gt; reports that almost half of Americans don’t get the recommended 7–9 hours of sleep on week nights. Because social media commonly involves interactive screen time, it may be more detrimental to sleep than more passive types of screen media, such as watching television. Among other mechanisms, social media use may also &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945710001632?via%3Dihub&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;impact sleep directly&lt;/a&gt; by displacing sleep and indirectly by promoting emotional, cognitive, and/or physiological arousal. Therefore, our research group has focused on the impact of social media use in particular, rather than screen time more generally, given its relevance to sleep health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0091743516000025&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;We previously showed&lt;/a&gt; that those who use social media more than two hours per day were about twice as likely to have disturbed sleep—including decreased sleep quality and difficulty falling asleep—compared to those who use social media 30 minutes per day or fewer. However, we had not yet examined the impact of the &lt;em&gt;time of day&lt;/em&gt; of social media use. While social media use may impact sleep regardless of the time of day, it may be particularly important before bedtime for three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;social media use may delay bedtime and displace time available for sleep;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mental activation can hinder ease of falling asleep;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the light from screen-based devices can delay the onset of sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/40/9/zsx113/3926043&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;we recently undertook a study&lt;/a&gt; to explore whether social media use in the 30 minutes just before bed was linked with poorer sleep, over and above social media use across the entire day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who was involved in the study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied 1,763 young adults between the ages of 19–32 who completed a web-based survey. They were recruited by randomly dialing phone numbers (cell phones and land lines) and by sampling a selection of addresses. The sample assessed in the study represents the young adult population across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did we measure social media use and sleep disturbance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We measured social media use in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To assess social media use over the entire day, we asked participants to report the typical total number of minutes per day they used social media for personal use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To assess social media use before bed, we asked participants to answer the question: “How frequently over the past year did you check social media in the 30 minutes before falling asleep at night?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assessed sleep disturbance using items on a web-based survey that assessed problems with sleep, difficulty falling asleep, whether sleep was refreshing, and sleep quality over the past seven days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to participants who rarely check social media before bed, those who most often check before bed were about 1.5 times more likely to have more disturbed sleep. This was still true even when we considered how much participants used social media across the entire day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;doesn’t &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this study tell us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we assessed social media use and sleep disturbance at the same time, this study can’t tell us whether social media use leads to disturbed sleep, or whether disturbed sleep contributes to social media use. Future studies will need to examine this over time to answer this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does this study matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If future work is able to determine that social media in the 30 minutes before bed use leads to disturbed sleep (rather than the other direction), this would suggest that young adults who want to improve their sleep should focus on reducing social media use at this particular time of day. Reducing social media use in the 30 minutes before bed may be more feasible and effective than reducing social media use across the entire day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrities are people famous for being famous. Have you ever given any thought to how it happens that pop-culture figures become so well-known, even when they have risen to the top upon a wave of interest for which there was not the slightest rational explanation? What is the real root cause of our lemming-like rush to keep tabs on insignificant but famous people? What leads us to share this information on social media? Why do we visit gossip portals and read tabloids, even though they’re totally worthless to us? Partial answers to these questions are given by a trio of researchers via a series of creative experiments that &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-32098-001&quot;&gt;they’ve reported&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychology of Popular Media Culture.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33800&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us are afraid of being excluded or ignored. The ability to detect and avoid ostracism likely developed for evolutionary reasons – as humans, remaining in groups enhances our survival. Often, even when the experience of ostracism seems trivial or rationally beneficial, we experience negative consequences. Nicole Iannone at Radford University and her colleagues concluded that the feeling of being “out of the loop” on popular culture may produce similar psychological consequences as partial ostracism – especially less “need satisfaction” (that is, less satisfaction of the four fundamental needs of belonging, self-esteem, meaningful existence, and control), reduced competence, and more negative moods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers asked American undergrad participants in a first experiment to view photographs of musicians who they were told are in the news at the moment and that most people in pilot research had recognised. In fact, some were chosen to be highly familiar (like Justin Bieber) and others less so (like Ellie Goulding).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Viewing musicians that were supposedly very famous, but whom the participants did not recognise, led them to report less need satisfaction and a slight increase in negative mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second experiment confirmed these results using a larger sample of students and pictures of actors. In a third experiment the researchers went one step further, finding similar psychological effects for failing to recognise supposedly famous pop culture logos, even among those participants who said pop culture isn’t important. This is surprising considering that people who supposedly don’t care about popular culture should not feel bad when they are unfamiliar with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final study replicated the previous results using a subtler method. The researchers simply asked students to indicate their pop culture preferences using Buzzfeed-style quizzes. Critically, some of the participants were quizzed about highly familiar celebrities and pop topics (movies, books, TV shows etc.) whereas others were quizzed about more obscure people and topics. A control group rated buildings. Even though there was no explicit mention of other people’s familiarity with the quiz items, those participants in the unfamiliar pop culture condition experienced an effect of being more out of the loop, including lower need satisfaction, and more negative mood (in contrast, those in the familiar pop culture condition did not experience a boost to need satisfaction compared with controls). These effects occurred regardless of participants’ beliefs about the importance of pop culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of these experiments suggest it is highly probable that our participation in pop culture is not due to its attractiveness, but rather the desire to avoid the negative emotions associated with the feeling of being out of the loop – at least among university-age people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is most striking is the fact that we do this even when declaring our indifference to pop culture. Our evolved sensitivity to ostracism protects us from social exclusion by directing our behaviours at a lemming-like rush towards shallow pop culture, which very few of us even care about. Perhaps the effects described here explain the shallowness of that culture. After all, it’s enough for us to be familiar with celebrity icons, to have heard about people famous for being famous. We can’t necessarily be bothered with what they have to offer us, and for sure, hearing about them won’t improve our mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-32098-001&quot;&gt;“Who’s that?”: The negative consequences of being out of the loop on pop culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/headphones-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsafe listening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/pbd/deafness/activities/MLS/en/&quot;&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that millions of adolescents and young adults are at the risk of developing hearing loss due to frequent exposure to high sound levels in noisy entertainment venues and with the unsafe use of personal listening devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphones have provided a means by which to download music for free and the ability to listen to this at the maximum volume without sound quality distortion. Subsequently, this means more people than ever are at risk of hearing loss if the necessary precautions are not taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum noise exposure levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of countries have suggested maximum noise exposure levels for personal listening devices to prevent noise-induced hearing loss, but these have typically applied to occupational noise-induced hearing loss criteria. As an example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has limited the daily safe volume level of any sound to below 85 decibels (dB) for a maximum of eight hours and Canadian federal regulations limit the sound exposure level to less than eight hours at 87 decibels adjusted (dBA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sound pressure levels in smartphones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-5399-4?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Public_Health-Public_Health-Global&amp;amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_MAY2018_Smartphone_volume_hearing_loss&quot;&gt;In their study published today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, Woojae Han and Gibbeum Kim at Hallym University, Republic of Korea, measured the sound pressure levels of four genres of music at the high-volume steps that smartphones propose as a risk for hearing loss and then compared the levels among different types of smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, they looked at two models from the three most popular smartphone companies in the Republic of Korea: the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note 3, the Apple iPhone 5S and iPhone 6, and the LG G2 and G3. They measured the sound pressure outputs using a sound level meter across the models at the volume prompting the hearing loss risk warning (if present) and at the maximum volume level, across four genres of music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the first hearing loss warning was prompted at the highest volume on the LG G2 phone at 92.4 dBA and at the lowest volume on the Samsung Galaxy S6 at 84.1dBA. The iPhone 6 had the loudest maximum volume warning at 113.1 dBA and the Galaxy Note 3 had the quietest at 107.03dBA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Han and Dr Kim also looked at the sound pressure outputs from different music genres, including three genres of K-pop music (dance-pop, hip-hop, and pop-ballad) and the US pop chart and found dance-pop had the highest volume output level at 91.1 dBA on all smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study confirms a significant 8-dB difference in the sound pressure levels for six kinds of smartphone at the first risk volume level, indicating the need for an international standard for the safe use of personal listening devices.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;PLOS, together with the Science, Nature, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and Cell families of journals issued a joint statement that addresses a recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-administrator-pruitt-proposes-rule-strengthen-science-used-epa-regulations&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;proposed rule&lt;/a&gt; from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLOS has always been a strong proponent of sharing data to improve the transparency of scientific research, but we recognize that some datasets cannot be made publicly available for ethical reasons. The EPA proposed rule is presented as informed by the journals’ policies. However, insisting on public availability of data would allow the EPA to exclude relevant data simply because it cannot be made publicly available. We believe this could prevent the use of relevant scientific evidence in the regulatory process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the joint statement &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2018/04/30/science.aau0116&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexfradera.net/&quot;&gt;Alex Fradera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1914, the psychologist Leta Hollingworth’s experiments punctured holes in the prevailing idea that menstruating affects women’s intellect. But a century on, the ovulation cycle continues to interest psychologists, who today focus on how it affects sexual behaviour. A popular evolutionary psychology theory states that during fertile periods, women become more interested in men who use dominant masculine behaviour, as this signals they are likely to provide good genes for any offspring. A University of Goettingen team have now conducted the largest ever test of this idea, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/7g3xc/&quot;&gt;published as a pre-print&lt;/a&gt; at PsyArxiv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33789&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “good genes ovulatory shift hypothesis” or GGOSH suggests that during fertile phases of the menstrual cycle women should be especially attracted to potential mates who are likely to provide good genes to their offspring. The hypothesis further states that such genes are signalled through men’s sexual assertiveness and confidence, via behaviours like flirting, smiling and directly gazing at women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence for GGOSH is sketchy. There are two relevant meta-analyses, both published in 2014 – one in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-06327-001&quot;&gt;Psychological Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the other in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1754073914523073&quot;&gt;Emotion Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – but only the first supported the hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the new study, led by Julia Jünger. Employing a stronger design than past research, her team tested the same subjects repeatedly (at different times in their cycle) rather than relying on different participants. They also used larger sample sizes and collected hormone data via saliva samples to validate the self-reports of where the women were on their cycle. The study was also pre-registered and the data made available for other researchers to review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 157 participants, heterosexual women aged 18-35, took part twice, in the fertile and the luteal (non-fertile) phases of their menstrual cycle. On each occasion, the women saw a series of 30-second video clips of single men in real interactions with an attractive woman they’d just met (however the woman was not visible in the clips). The men’s behaviour varied in the amount they smiled, the time they spent gazing at the woman’s face, how much they spoke during the clip, and other flirtatious actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the more fertile period of their cycle, the women found the men more sexually attractive – on average, they were more interested in pursuing a potentially short-term and purely sexual relationship with them (a pattern that was mediated by the levels of the hormone estriadol in their saliva: more estriadol correlated with more attraction), and they were more interested in long-term relationships with them too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fertility-attraction link confirms a well-established finding, but the GGOSH makes a much more specific prediction – that women will find dominant, flirtatious behaviours in particular more attractive during fertility, and here the data suggested otherwise. Eye contact, confident body language, smiles – none of these mattered more during greater fertility, against the predictions of the hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GGOSH also predicts that good-gene markers will be particularly valued by fertile-phase women who are already in a relationship (the idea is that they already have a safe nest in which to raise a kid, so will not be too fussed that dominant mates with good genes may be less reliable). In fact, the dominant “good genes” behaviours weren’t any more attractive to partnered women during their fertile phase. This is two firm strikes against the hypothesis.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the women’s relationship status did make a difference to their overall levels of attraction in the men – when the researchers conducted their analyses separately for partnered and single women, they found that it was only partnered women whose overall sexual interest in the men increased during the fertile phase of their cycle, perhaps, the researchers suggested, because having&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;a partner they can rely on to raise a family increases women’s interest in sex (though it would be easy to have come up with an ad-hoc evolutionary explanation for the complete opposite result, so I would suggest waiting for this finding to be replicated before drawing conclusions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the GGSOH, while this research reaffirmed that the ovulatory cycle affects women’s interest in sex, thanks to shifts in hormones, it does not support the hypothesis that it swivels their minds towards a different object of desire. So if any aspiring pick-up gurus were hoping to build a creepy philosophy around switching up your style at points in the cycle, they will be disappointed. And women shouldn’t be concerned that during times when their body is amping up sexual desire it is also dictating who that desire should be projected towards.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/7g3xc/&quot;&gt;No evidence for ovulatory cycle shifts in women’s preferences for men’s behaviors in a pre-registered study&lt;/a&gt; [this study is a pre-print meaning that it has not yet been subject to peer review]&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0039&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;knowledge about the meanings of words, objects, and other entities&quot;&gt;semantic knowledge&lt;/a&gt; represented and stored in the brain? A classic way of addressing this question is via single-case studies of patients with brain lesions that lead to a unique pattern of deficits. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-resources/agnosia/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Agnosia&lt;/a&gt; is the inability to recognize some class (or classes) of entities such as objects or persons. Agnosia in the visual modality is most widely studied, but agnosias in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25726291&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;impairments in sound perception and identification despite intact hearing, cognitive functioning, and language abilities&quot;&gt;auditory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/p5563&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;olfactory&lt;/a&gt; modalities have been reported as well. A key element is that basic sensory processing is intact, but higher-order recognition of complex entities is impaired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agnosias that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12907231&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;specific&lt;/a&gt; for items in a particular category (e.g., animals, fruits/vegetables, tools, etc.) are sometimes observed. An ongoing debate posits that some category-specific dissociations may fall out along sensory/functional lines (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7885576&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Warrington&lt;/a&gt; view), or along domain-specific lines (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12907231&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Caramazza&lt;/a&gt; view).&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The former suggests that knowledge of living things is more reliant on vision (you don't pick up and use an alligator), while knowledge of tools is more reliant on how you use them. The latter hypothesis suggests that evolutionary pressures led to distinct neural systems for processing different categories of objects.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much less work has examined how nonverbal auditory knowledge is represented in the brain. A new paper reports on a novel category-specific deficit in an expert bird-watcher who developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_dementia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of semantic memory in both the verbal and non-verbal domains&quot;&gt;semantic dementia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393218301179&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Muhammed et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;). Patient BA lost the ability to identify birds by their songs, but not by their appearance. As explained by the authors: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;BA is a dedicated amateur birder with some 30 years’ experience,  including around 10 weeks each spring spent in birdwatching expeditions  and over the years had also regularly attended courses in bird call  recognition, visual identification and bird behaviour. He had extensive  exposure to a range of bird species representing all major regions and  habitats of the British Isles. He had noted waning of his ability to  name birds or identify them from their calls over a similar timeframe to  his evolving difficulty with general vocabulary. At the time of  assessment, he was also becoming less competent at identifying birds  visually but he continued to enjoy recognising and feeding the birds  that visited his garden. There had been no suggestion of any difficulty  recognising familiar faces or household items nor any difficulty  recognising the voices of telephone callers or everyday noises. There  had been no evident change in BA's appreciation of music.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BA's brain showed a pattern of degeneration characteristic of semantic dementia, with asymmetric atrophy affecting the anterior, medial, and inferior temporal lobes, to a greater extent in the left hemisphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4Eocmzuwv80/WuacMHg2zeI/AAAAAAAAMhU/UsNSz5_9J9otZlTAw1jnwWC2pEVezal4gCLcBGAs/s1600/BA%2Bbird%2Bcall%2Bbrain.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;514&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;127&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4Eocmzuwv80/WuacMHg2zeI/AAAAAAAAMhU/UsNSz5_9J9otZlTAw1jnwWC2pEVezal4gCLcBGAs/s400/BA%2Bbird%2Bcall%2Bbrain.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig. 1 (modified from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393218301179&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Muhammed et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Note that L side of brain shown on R side of scan.&lt;/i&gt; Coronal sections of BA's T1-weighted volumetric brain MRI through &lt;b&gt;(A)&lt;/b&gt; temporal poles; &lt;b&gt;(B)&lt;/b&gt; mid-anterior temporal lobes; and &lt;b&gt;(C)&lt;/b&gt; temporo-parietal junctional zones. There is more severe involvement of the left temporal lobe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The authors developed a specialized test of bird knowledge in the auditory, visual, and verbal modalities. The performance of BA was compared to that of three birders similar in age and experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kmeWzl1sLvE/WuagG7e4sUI/AAAAAAAAMhg/pYsUZWvVBVU8PfO_xgjrJG__srKtvVkqgCLcBGAs/s1600/bird%2Bknowledge.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;942&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;235&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kmeWzl1sLvE/WuagG7e4sUI/AAAAAAAAMhg/pYsUZWvVBVU8PfO_xgjrJG__srKtvVkqgCLcBGAs/s400/bird%2Bknowledge.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results indicated that “BA performed below the control range for bird knowledge derived from  calls and names but within the control range for knowledge derived from  appearance.” There was a complicated pattern of results for his knowledge of specific semantic characteristics in the different modalities, but the basic finding suggested an agnosia for bird calls. Interestingly, he performed as well as controls on tests of famous  voices and famous face pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, the findings suggest separate auditory and visual routes to avian conceptual knowledge, at least in this expert birder. Also fascinating was the preservation of famous person identification via voice and image. The authors conclude with a ringing endorsement of single case studies in neuropsychology:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;This analysis transcends the effects of acquired expertise and  illustrates how single case experiments that address apparently  idiosyncratic phenomena can illuminate neuropsychological processes of  more general relevance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;link via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/utafrith/status/990546566552412161&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@utafrith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caramazza A, Mahon BZ.

 I’ve been thinking lately about the question of what leads scientists to choose a discipline. Why does someone end up as a chemist rather than a biologist? A geneticist as opposed to a cognitive neuroscientist?

We might hope that people choose their discipline based on an understanding of what doing research in each discipline involves, but I don't think this often happens. I know it didn't happen in my case. Here, then, is how I became a neuroscientist.

		<link href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/542172078/0/oupblogpsychology/"/>
		<id>https://blog.oup.com/?p=137816</id>
		<updated>2018-04-28T10:30:25+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Tragic events such as recent natural disasters and shootings at school affect many children and families. Although these events typically receive immediate media coverage and short-term supports, the long-term implications are often overlooked. The grief among children and adolescents experiencing significant loss generally emerges during the weeks and months following such tragic events. Although there are variations in the expression of grief, bereaved children and adolescents often struggle to meet the cognitive demands of school. Professionals at school, including, school psychologists, school counselors, and other mental health professionals have a tremendous opportunity to help identify and support students in need. Such support at school is helpful in facilitating healthy adjustment and coping strategies among bereaved students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding grief and mourning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;grief&lt;/em&gt; refers to an individual’s personal experience, thoughts, and feelings associated with a loss. The term &lt;em&gt;mourning&lt;/em&gt; refers to the externalized manifestation of grief. Mourning rituals, such as funerals, memorial services, and commemorative activities can facilitate grief. Culture influences the grieving process, and it is important to consider the vast range of ways that individuals and families mourn the death of others. For example, being sensitive to family preferences surrounding funerals or memorials helps ensure that you’re honoring their beliefs and values. It is also critical to note that some individuals may not feel comfortable expressing their grief at school, and instead prefer to do it privately with family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grief is often emotional and can bring up different feelings simultaneously, such as sadness, anger, fear, or worry. Grief is also physical and can be felt in different parts of a person’s body. A child or adult who is grieving may have trouble sleeping, eating, and may experience somatic difficulties such as headaches or stomachaches. Finally, grief can also show up in someone’s behaviors, such as through crying, separating oneself from other people, and having trouble focusing or sitting still. At the same time, other individuals may appear to be less affected, despite the fact that they may still be experiencing many of these symptoms. This is because for some people, depending on their age and ability to deal with their grief, they want to continue to have control over their life and maintain normal routines. This can sometimes be helpful for them to manage their grief, especially while at school or in public. Because of the widespread effects grief can have on an individual’s functioning, it is critical that students, school-staff, and parents obtain effective support when grieving the death of one or more significant person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elementary school children (6-12) are typically able to relate to death more easily than younger children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Considerations for schools and families&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children express grief differently due to a variety of factors, including their age, cognitive abilities, and cultural surroundings. Young children are typically better able to express their grief through play, make-believe, and drawings instead of verbally. They also tend to be more vulnerable to the withdrawal or excessive displays of grief of their caregivers and need consistent love and support. Elementary school children (6-12) are typically able to relate to death more easily than younger children and ask a lot of questions and obtain knowledge to better understand what happened. Within this age range, they understand that death is final and that all living things die. Adolescents (13-18) are sometimes more self-conscious and although they may be spending more time with friends, they may be less likely to share their feelings with their friends. Typically around ages 15-18, they feel more comfortable expressing their feelings and their grief is more similar to that of adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of age, grief can significantly affect children and teenagers in various ways. Because of the variety of symptoms someone may experience when grieving, he or she may be less focused or motivated in school, or appear more withdrawn or tired. Furthermore, because a grieving youth may be experiencing a range of emotions, with some being uncomfortable for that individual, the youth may experience sudden outbursts of either anger or sadness. Families and schools are encouraged to remember that this is to be expected, and that youth need to be supported when experiencing these difficult emotions. However, additional support and follow-up may be needed if the youth is exhibiting a significant loss of interest in daily activities, is chronically absent, and has a significant fear of being alone, among other symptoms. These changes should be significant and not minor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional support and follow-up may occur in a variety of ways, such as having a school-based mental health professional, like a school psychologist or counselor, provide individual or group support to the youth. This will enable the youth to process difficult feelings, have the opportunity to share their story, and talk about positive and difficult memories. When appropriate, receiving support through a grief group can be particularly effective, as it can help normalize their feelings and make the youth feel less alone. Ensuring that teachers and families are knowledgeable about the grief process and how to effectively support grieving youth is also critical. It may be particularly difficult for teachers or families who are also grieving the same death as the youth, emphasizing the importance of self-care and support for adults. Given that most children will experience the death of at least one close or special person prior to high school graduation, and because the vast majority of children ages 7 to 18 attend school on a regular basis, it is essential that school-based professionals be prepared to effectively support bereaved students.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h4&gt;Ken Dawson-Scully Named Associate V.P. for Strategic Initiatives, Head of Institutional Partnerships at FAU and MPFI&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida Atlantic University and Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) have combined forces to form the first jointly supported position between the two institutions. As of May 1, Ken Dawson-Scully, Ph.D., will be newly appointed to the role of associate vice president for strategic initiatives and head of institutional partnerships for FAU and MPFI. Joining FAU in 2008, Dawson-Scully served as associate director of the FAU Brain Institute and most recently as an associate professor of biological sciences and associate dean for graduate studies in FAU’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For almost a decade, the close and synergistic partnership between Florida Atlantic University and Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience has been undeniably beneficial for our institutions and Palm Beach County,” said FAU President John Kelly. “This latest initiative will foster tremendous returns on our co-investment for educational and research opportunities, economic development, as well as faculty and student recruitment. Together, we will continue to strengthen our thriving alliance; enhancing recognition and visibility both locally and globally.”&lt;br /&gt;
In this joint FAU/MPFI position, Dawson-Scully will work closely with the executive leadership team of both institutions under the direction of Matthias Haury, Ph.D., MPFI’s COO and Jeff Atwater, FAU’s vice president for strategic initiatives and CFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to further reinforce the flourishing relationship with our partners at Florida Atlantic University. Our joint efforts will continue to facilitate unique collaborative opportunities between our institutions and inspire a vibrant, creative space where groundbreaking innovations in science and technology will prosper,” said David Fitzpatrick, Ph.D., CEO and scientific director of MPFI. “This collaborative environment will allow us the opportunity to better tackle the areas of focus that are critical to the success of both of our institutions’ missions, goals and aspirations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his new role, Dawson-Scully will be responsible for developing and implementing key initiatives in areas that are crucial to FAU and MPFI. These initiatives will include co-branding programs, enhancing infrastructure, developing new educational programs, identifying and securing joint funding opportunities, conducting research training, building partnerships, and fostering collaboration between academic and administrative units.&lt;br /&gt;
Additionally, as the head of this new initiative, Dawson-Scully will act as a liaison for both institutes, developing and sustaining strong relationships with local and international foundations, corporations, government and community groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am both honored and excited to serve in this new capacity for Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience and Florida Atlantic University. My ultimate goal is to escalate our international reputation and expand our distinguished faculty, recruiting talented students and world-class scientists to our institutions,” said Dawson-Scully. “By combining our expertise, knowledge and resources, our close partnership will generate significant impact, benefitting the local, regional and international communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent joint program, where FAU and MPFI have partnered, is the FAU Max Planck Honors Program. The FAU MPHP is an elite undergraduate program that can be accomplished as an undergraduate student, in either FAU’s Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College or the College of Science, focused on the John D. MacArthur Campus at Jupiter. Applications for the first cohort for this fall are due April 30, and more information for the FAU MPHP can be found at http://fau.edu/mphp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawson-Scully received his Ph.D. from the University of Toronto in 2003, and his M.Sc. from Queen’s University in 1998. He currently serves on the steering committee and is a faculty member of the newly formed International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS). A highly accomplished researcher, his work investigates ways to protect the brain from neurodegeneration caused by acute or chronic cellular stress using the genetic model organism, the fruit fly or D. melanogaster. Dawson-Scully has identified a number of molecular targets in the fruit fly nervous system that can rescue the damaging effects of pathological conditions such as high temperature, low oxygen, and oxidative stress. This impactful research opens up new avenues for the future treatment of human diseases such as stroke and epilepsy. His findings, which have been successfully translated from fly, to zebrafish, fresh water turtle, and mouse, have led to the submissions of four novel United States patents for the medical treatment of febrile seizure, migraine, and stroke in humans. Dawson-Scully also serves as the chief scientific officer for Neuro Pharmalogics, Inc., an FAU Tech Runway® start-up company that has licensed his intellectual property for the purpose of creating novel therapeutics aimed at combating brain related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the adverts for anti-ageing skin products, everyone is smiling, positively blooming with youthfulness. A canny move by the marketeers you might think – after all, past research has found most of us believe smiling makes people look younger. It’s just that actually, it doesn’t. It makes you look older. That’s according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13423-017-1306-8&quot;&gt;a new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Psychonomic Bulletin and Review&lt;/em&gt; that explores an intriguing mismatch between our beliefs and perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33772&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzvi Ganel at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and Melvyn Goodale at the University of Western Ontario began by asking 40 participants (23 women; average age 24) to estimate the age of 35 women and 35 men from photographs of their faces. Participants saw one of two versions of each model’s face, in which they were either smiling or had a neutral expression. On average, the participants rated the faces as older, by about a year, when they saw them smiling compared with when they had a neutral expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, most of the participants (33/40) stated afterwards that they believed smiling makes you look younger. Also, when asked to estimate the average age they’d given for all of the smiling faces they’d viewed and the average age they’d given to the neutral faces, they thought erroneously that they’d rated the smiling faces as younger (presumably in keeping with their belief that smiling makes you look younger).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new results are consistent with &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13423-015-0822-7&quot;&gt;an earlier series of studies&lt;/a&gt; by Ganel in which he presented evidence that the ageing effect of smiling (on this occasion of one to two years) is due to the way it increases wrinkles around the eyes. For instance, the ageing effect disappeared when he filtered out eye wrinkles or presented only the lower half of smiling faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the this latest research, Ganel and Goodale followed up with a second experiment in which 42 more participants estimated the ages of faces that were either smiling, neutral or looking surprised. Again, the same person’s face was estimated to be older when smiling compared with when holding a neutral expression. Meanwhile surprised faces were rated as younger than neutral faces, perhaps because the facial expression of surprise acts to smooth out eye wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked to estimate the average age they’d guessed for smiling, neutral and surprised faces, the participants again mistakenly thought that they’d rated smiling faces as younger than neutral faces. On the other hand, they estimated that they’d given the surprised faces the same average age as the neutral faces, seemingly unaware that they’d actually rated them as younger (presumably due to the lack of any specific beliefs about the effects of a surprised expression on appearance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The findings show, for the first time, that people can erroneously believe that smiling makes one appear younger, while at the same time rating smiling faces as older than neutral faces,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we can’t tell from these findings what part memory plays in the effects, if any. Did participants mistakenly think they’d estimated a younger average age for smiling faces because of the influence of their &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt; that smiling faces look younger or because they actually &lt;em&gt;remembered &lt;/em&gt;the smiling faces as younger? Also, I wonder whether it makes any difference whether a smile is genuine or not – genuine or “Duchenne” smiles are known to involve more crinkling of the muscles around the eyes, so perhaps they have a greater ageing effect than feigned smiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These unresolved issues aside, the results suggest that if you’d like to present a more youthful version of yourself on your Twitter or Facebook page, you should delete that grinning selfie and switch for a neutral pose or even a look of surprise. Or you could just dig out an old photo of a younger you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13423-017-1306-8&quot;&gt;The effects of smiling on perceived age defy belief&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Defect prediction relies on data and modelling techniques. Previous work has predominantly been focused to improving the latter. Despite numerous studies exploiting a wide range of machine learning techniques, prediction accuracies improve at a slow pace. On the other hand, the focus on data has somewhat been limited. High-quality data is difficult to obtain and mostly consists of metrics which have been lingering round for a long time. Due to the influx of digital data, other fields have developed some interesting techniques for its analysis. In this journal club I will discuss some of those techniques for data analysis and link them to their possible use in defect prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Defect prediction relies on data and modelling techniques. Previous work has predominantly been focused to improving the latter. Despite numerous studies exploiting a wide range of machine learning techniques, prediction accuracies improve at a slow pace. On the other hand, the focus on data has somewhat been limited. High-quality data is difficult to obtain and mostly consists of metrics which have been lingering round for a long time. Due to the influx of digital data, other fields have developed some interesting techniques for its analysis. In this journal club I will discuss some of those techniques for data analysis and link them to their possible use in defect prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/rGONAD-Blog-fig-1-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10146&quot; height=&quot;409&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/rGONAD-Blog-fig-e1524755679676.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genome-edited animals are widely used in various fields of research. Recent advances in the field of genome-editing, especially the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats /CRISPR associated protein), have enabled rapid generation of genome-edited animals with ease. However, the procedure for producing such animals involves multiple complicated steps and also necessitates special techniques, such as handling zygotes &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Many researchers desire a simple and convenient method for generating genome-edited animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laboratory rat (&lt;em&gt;Rattus norvegicus&lt;/em&gt;) is a common model of human diseases. Although there are several advantages compared with using mice, technology for handling the rat genome has lagged behind. A new, more simple method for genome editing in rats is now available, namely rGONAD (rat Genome-editing via Oviductal Nucleic Acids Delivery).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the GONAD method has so far been successfully implemented in mice and rats, this concept can be adapted for other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rGONAD method involves two key steps: an injection with the solution containing Cas9 protein, guide RNA and single strand DNA (ssDNA) into the oviduct, followed by electroporation. Rats that have undergone rGONAD are bred as usual until birth, where offspring would be genome-edited and used for further analyses. Moreover, rGONAD is highly efficient in both knock-out and knock-in systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current standard method for genome-engineering in animals involves three major steps: isolation of zygotes from females, micromanipulation &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt; and then transfer into pseudopregnant females. These steps are complicated and require skillful training to perform; rGONAD overcomes these caveats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in the ethical context of the 3Rs (Reduction, Replacement, and Refinement), the standard method consumes many females, whereas female rats can be recycled in the rGONAD system. Although the GONAD method has so far been successfully implemented in mice and rats, this concept can be adapted for other animals. Therefore, GONAD is a powerful method for genome-editing in animal research.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h4&gt;The recognition includes presentation of inaugural John Lisman ’66 Memorial Lecture in Vision Science&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, April 10, David Fitzpatrick, Ph.D., CEO and Scientific Director of the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), delivered the inaugural John Lisman ’66 Memorial Lecture in Vision Science at Brandeis University. The medium-sized private research university, based outside of Boston and known for its excellent undergraduate education, also presented the award given in conjunction to the lecture to Dr. Fitzpatrick. The award is in recognition of his work as a leader in systems neuroscience, with a focus on the functional organization and development of neural circuits in the cerebral cortex. The public lecture was titled “Functional Synaptic Architecture in Primary Visual Cortex.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formerly called the Jay Pepose ’75 Award in Vision Sciences, the name was changed in 2017 to memorialize John Lisman ’66, Ph.D., who earned his undergraduate degree in physics from Brandeis in 1966. He went on to earn a doctorate in physiology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University under Nobel Laureate George Wald. He returned to Brandeis in 1974 as an assistant professor and then a full professor in 1987. Dr. Lismann passed away in 2017 at the age of 73.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am honored to receive the inaugural John Lisman ’66 Memorial Lecture in Vision Science,” said Dr. Fitzpatrick. “Dr. Lisman was a leader in neurosciences and an integral force behind the Pepose Award, from his work in selecting the recipients to his role as host of the lecture and dinner each year. I am truly thankful for both the opportunity and recognition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fitzpatrick’s research has played a pivotal role in defining the functional organization of cortical circuits, exploring rules of intracortical connectivity, addressing mechanisms of neural coding, and probing the role of experience in the maturation of cortical circuits. His current research utilizes state-of-the-art in vivo imaging techniques to probe the functional synaptic architecture of circuits in primary visual cortex, defining the circuit mechanisms that build the selective response properties of cortical neurons, and the critical role that neural activity plays in the proper maturation of these circuits. He earned his doctorate from Duke University in Psychology and Neuroscience, and his bachelor’s degree from Pennsylvania State University in Biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past winners of the Pepose Award include David Williams, University of Rochester; William Newsome, Stanford University; Richard Masland, Harvard University; Gordon Fain, University of California, Los Angeles; Michael Stryker, University of California, San Francisco; Peter Schiller, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Jay and Maureen Neitz, University of Washington; and Frank Werblin, a leading retina researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pepose is the founder and medical director of the Pepose Vision Institute in St. Louis and a professor of clinical ophthalmology at Washington University. He founded and serves as board president of the Lifelong Vision Foundation, whose mission is to preserve lifelong vision for people in the St. Louis community, nationally and internationally through research, community programs and education programs. He was part of the inaugural class of fellows of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology. While a student at Brandeis, he worked closely with John Lisman, who began his career at the University when Dr. Pepose was an undergraduate. Dr. Pepose was the first student to join Dr. Lisman’s research group on campus. Dr. Lisman was an influential mentor to him and they remained lifelong friends until his passing.&lt;/p&gt;

 Decades ago, unbeknownst to each other, two chemists were independently working on a screening approach to identify new potential drugs. Both published papers about the technique around the same time. So now, when scientists write papers that cite the technique, who should get credit for discovering it? Decades later, that question still hasn’t been answered … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2018/04/26/chemists-duke-it-out-over-who-was-first-to-discover-a-30-year-old-technique/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Chemists duke it out over who was first to discover a 30-year-old technique&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Does the prospect of taking a “Facebook holiday” fill you with dread as you picture a life of social isolation, or does it sound like an appealing and refreshing chance to change priorities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2018.1453467&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; has investigated the psychological effects of taking time off from using Facebook. Given that Facebook helps keep us connected but can also expose us to many social stressors, like envy and gossip, the researchers, led by Eric Vanman at the University of Queensland, expected to find a Facebook break would be associated with a drop in life-satisfaction, but also a reduction in stress levels. Their findings are largely in line with their predictions “[and] consistent with the general ambivalent feelings that may typify most active users about Facebook”. However, the study also features ambiguities and limitations that may leave sceptical readers unconvinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33754&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanman and his colleagues invited 138 active Facebook users (they averaged 2.8 hours daily use) to the psych lab where they provided a saliva cortisol sample and completed psychological questionnaires tapping their Facebook use, life-satisfaction, stress, mood and loneliness. This initial data showed that more active Facebook users reported higher life-satisfaction and less loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critically, half of the participants learned at this time that they would be required to take a five-day hiatus from Facebook (they knew from the study advert that this might be a possibility). All the participants then wrote about what they thought the ensuing days would be like and they gave another saliva sample. Finally, all participants returned to the lab five days later, to repeat the questionnaires, report their social movements during the intervening Sunday, and provide one further saliva cortisol sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all the participants in the Facebook-hiatus condition wrote that they expected it to be a pretty miserable time. “&lt;em&gt;I will probably feel … upset as my social life will be totally stopped if I cannot used Facebook and cannot find my friends in Facebook, I will also feel like left behind as I will not be able to know what has happened with my Facebook friends in the coming five days&lt;/em&gt;,” wrote one participant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results matched these expectations in that the No-Facebook group reported lower life satisfaction at the end of the study than those in the Facebook-as-normal condition (the average life satisfaction for the Facebook-as-normal group had increased during the study whereas the No-Facebook group’s had not). There were no group differences in mood through the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The No-Facebook group experienced this hit to their life-satisfaction despite the fact they reported an average of more than two hours extra face-to-face socialising on the Sunday during the study period compared to the Facebook-as-normal group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on the positive side, the No-Facebook group showed a reduction in their cortisol levels over the course of the study. Cortisol is often described as a stress hormone and it may provide a physiological marker of stress levels. However, cortisol fluctuates a lot and it’s difficult to interpret the meaning of this change, especially based on so few measures. Indeed, the No-Facebook group didn’t actually report a decrease in their stress levels on the questionnaires (and cortisol levels within the group didn’t correlate with self-reported stress levels). It’s worth noting too that across all participants, cortisol levels at baseline were not associated with any of the study’s other measures, such as intensity of Facebook use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said that their study is “the first to demonstrate the effects of Facebook use on a physiological measure associated with health outcomes” and they interpreted their results as showing that “taking short breaks from Facebook could be beneficial to one’s health, as any prolonged stress could contribute to mental and physical disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a conclusion may be premature, or at least overly specific. Other than the diary reports of the Sunday, we do not know if or how the participants in the No-Facebook group supplemented their usual time on Facebook with different activities, whether online or offline. Might the cortisol reduction have been linked to less time on the internet, and more time going for walks or chatting face-to-face, for instance, rather than taking a break from Facebook specifically? And just how meaningful is the cortisol result when the participants didn’t report feeling any less stressed, and considering that the cortisol levels for both groups were in the “normal range” at the start of the study?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to interpret the hit to life satisfaction too. As the researchers acknowledged, there is a big difference between choosing to take a break from Facebook and having one partly imposed, as was the situation in the current study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these ambiguities the results certainly provide food for thought and will surely inspire more research on the psychological effects of taking breaks from Facebook and other online social networks. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the ensuing “delete Facebook” campaign, it would be particularly interesting to find out the psychological effects of a permanent break from Facebook rather than a mere five-day holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/25/study-of-long-term-heterosexual-couples-finds-women-over-estimate-and-men-underestimate-their-partners-sexual-advances/"/>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Imagine that, during a quiet evening at home watching a movie with your romantic partner, you feel intense sexual desire and sensually put a hand on your partner’s thigh. Your partner does not respond and blithely continues to watch the movie… Is your partner truly not interested in sexual activity, or did she/he simply miss your cue?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So begins &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407517743081&quot;&gt;a new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Social and Personal Relationships&lt;/i&gt;, that explores how accurate heterosexual people are at judging their partner’s attempts to initiate sex – in terms of their ability to the spot their partner’s cues, and also their overall impression of how often their partner makes sexual advances. It’s important, because as the researchers, led by Kiersten Dobson at the University of Western Ontario in Canada, note, “Sexual satisfaction is associated with relationship happiness, whereas sexual dissatisfaction is associated with relationship dissolution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33758&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other studies have found that in casual, short-term relationships, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/15/men-and-women-interpret-the-sexual-intent-behind-dating-behaviours-very-differently/&quot;&gt;men tend to overestimate a partner’s sexual interest (while women either underestimate it, or show no bias either way; they’re fairly accurate)&lt;/a&gt;. An evolutionary psychology explanation for a male tendency to think women are more interested than they actually are is that – in a casual relationship – while incorrectly perceiving interest and being rejected might not feel great, missing the signs of interest, and so a chance to mate, is worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore what happens in longer-term relationships, the researchers recruited 120 heterosexual couples aged 18-51 (but with a mean age of 22), who had been together for between three months and 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An initial, exploratory study involved half the couples. The participants all privately completed a battery of questionnaires, which included questions about how often they and their partner attempt to initiate sex and how often they and their partner turn down an opportunity for sex. Then they rated how often these events typically occur over a one-month period (from “never” to “more than 11 times a month”).&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, they read short descriptions of 29 behaviours that might indicate sexual interest (such as “I put my hand on my partner’s thigh”) and were asked to rate the degree to which they and they partner use each of these behaviours to indicate that they are interested in having sex. The participants also completed questionnaire assessments of their sexual satisfaction and love for their partner.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that both men and women were pretty good at identifying the behaviours that their own partners use to indicate that they’d like to have sex. However, on average, the women overestimated the number of times that their partner tried to initiate sex, whereas the men got it about right.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second, similar, confirmatory study, involving the other 60 couples, found that the participants were again pretty good at recognising the behaviours that their own partner uses to indicate interest in having sex. In this group, the women also thought that their partners made more sexual advances than they actually did (according to the partner data), but only marginally. However, the men &lt;i&gt;under&lt;/i&gt;estimated their partner’s advances.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again from an evolutionary psychology perspective, the researchers speculate that for men in a long-term relationship, compared with a casual one, the costs associated with missing the signs of sexual interest may be lower (as there will be plenty more opportunities to have sex) and the costs of rejection will be higher (as being rejected by a long-term partner could be more painful). But as the results from the two studies were in part inconsistent, more work is needed before any firm conclusions on bias can be drawn, they note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to sexual satisfaction and love, people who overestimated their partner’s sexual advances reported feeling more sexual satisfaction. This might be because they felt more attractive and desired by their partner, the researchers suggest.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, people with partners who under-estimated their own advances reported feeling more love and greater sexual satisfaction – perhaps because the under-estimater feels motivated to do something to strengthen the relationship, which may then make their partner feel more satisfied.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researchers note, “Navigating sexual activity can be difficult, especially when partners’ behaviours that indicate their sexual interest are subtle.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers would like to see studies investigating how perceptions – and misperceptions – of sexual advances may affect relationships in the long term. But it would also, I think, be interesting to see a more real-time version of this study. Since other work has found that men under-report their own sexual intentions, it’s hard not to wonder whether the women in this study were really over-estimating their partners’ advances. Asking participants to report back daily, or every time they thought they or their partner had made a sexual advance – and whether or not it led to sex – would surely provide more accurate data than retrospective estimates of what happened in the course of a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407517743081&quot;&gt;Are you coming on to me? Bias and accuracy in couples’ perceptions of sexual advances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/04/4305510994_52ae7f40e1_b-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to recognize, process and interpret written language is a uniquely human skill that is acquired with remarkable ease at a young age. But as anyone who has attempted to learn a new language will attest, the brain isn’t “hardwired” to understand written language. In fact, it remains somewhat of a mystery how the brain develops this specialized ability. Although researchers have identified brain regions that process written words, how this selectivity for language develops isn’t entirely clear. A recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004103&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology study&lt;/a&gt; by researchers from the University Paris-Saclay adds significantly to our understanding of the changes supporting reading acquisition in the child brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have shown that the ventral visual cortex supports recognition of an array of visual stimuli, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11912041&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;objects, faces, and places&lt;/a&gt;. Within this area, a subregion in the left hemisphere known as the “visual word form area” (VWFA) shows a particular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11960895&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;selectivity for written words&lt;/a&gt;. However, this ventral occipitotemporal region is characteristically plastic. It’s been proposed that stimuli compete for representation in this malleable area, such that “winner takes all” depending on the strongest input. Supporting this idea, studies have reported that higher reading ability is related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21071632&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reduced responsivity to faces&lt;/a&gt; and stronger right lateralization of face representation, suggesting that word representation may invade neural real estate devoted to face processing. But this idea has yet to be confirmed, and the evolution of specialized brain areas for reading in children is still poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The emergence of brain’s word form area&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their study, Dehaene-Lambertz and colleagues monitored the reading abilities and brain changes of ten six-year old children to track the emergence of word specialization during a critical development period. Over the course of their first school-year, children were assessed every two months with reading evaluations and functional MRI while viewing words and non-word images (houses, objects, faces, bodies). As expected, reading ability improved over the year of first grade, as demonstrated by increased reading speed, word span, and phoneme knowledge, among other measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even at this young age, when reading ability was newly acquired, words evoked widespread left-lateralized brain activation, most strongly in ventral occipitotemporal cortex. This activity increased over the year of school, with the greatest boost occurring after just the first few months. Importantly, there were no similar activation increases in response to other stimuli, confirming that these adaptations were specific to reading ability, not a general effect of development or education. Immediately after school began, the brain volume specialized for reading also significantly increased. Furthermore, reading speed was associated with greater activity, particularly in the VWFA. Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/functional-mri-2/lecture/vUC9d/module-25-multi-voxel-pattern-analysis-a-neuroscientific-perspective&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;multivoxel pattern analysis&lt;/a&gt; to examine patterns of brain activity, the researchers found that activation patterns to words became more reliable with learning. In contrast, the patterns for other categories remained stable, with the exception of numbers, which may reflect specialization for symbols (words and numbers) generally, or correlation with the simultaneous development of mathematics skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What predisposes one brain region over another to take on this specialized role for reading words? Before school, there was no strong preference for any other category in regions that would later become word-responsive. However, brain areas that were destined to remain “non-word” regions showed more stable responses to non-word stimuli even before learning to read. Thus, perhaps the brain takes advantage of unoccupied real-estate to perform the newly acquired skill of reading. The VWFA showed the expected word-specific multi-voxel activation pattern, but also showed activity patterns unique to other visual categories. This suggests that reading does not, in fact, invade and replace regions devoted to other functions, but that representations for words and other stimuli can overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading development model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings add a critical piece to the puzzle of how reading skills are acquired in the developing child brain. Though it was already known that reading recruits a specialized brain region for words, this study reveals that this occurs &lt;em&gt;without changing&lt;/em&gt; the organization of areas already specialized for other functions. The authors propose an elegant model for the developmental brain changes underlying reading skill acquisition (Figure). In the illiterate child, there are adjacent columns or patches of cortex either tuned to a specific category (e.g., faces, tools, etc.), or not yet assigned a function. With literacy, the free subregions become tuned to words, while the previously specialized subregions remain stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/04/journal.pbio_.2004103.g008.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19571&quot; height=&quot;173&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/04/journal.pbio_.2004103.g008-300x173.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plastic developing cortex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid emergence of the word area after just a brief learning period highlights the remarkable plasticity of the developing cortex. In individuals who become literate as adults, the same VWFA is present. However, in contrast to children, the relation between reading speed and activation in this area &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21071632&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;is weaker&lt;/a&gt; in adults, and a single adult &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mbe.12143&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;case-study&lt;/a&gt; by the authors showed a much slower, gradual development of the VWFA over a prolonged learning period of several months. As the researchers note, “&lt;em&gt;the fast changes induced by reading acquisition that we observed here betray the intense plasticity of children’s immature ventral occipitotemporal cortex&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primed to read&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the malleability of the VWFA and surrounding cortex, its location was consistent across children, stable and reproducible. This suggests that its location is, to some extent, pre-constrained. Yet the factors that predestine this region for word selectivity remain a mystery, and as the authors explain, “&lt;em&gt;the precise identification of those constraints, whether cytoarchitectural or connectional, is an important goal for further research&lt;/em&gt;.” Whatever the reason, this region appears primed to rapidly adopt novel representations of symbolic words, and this priming may peak at a specific period in childhood. This finding underscores the importance of a strong education in youth. The authors surmise that “&lt;em&gt;the success of education might also rely on the right timing to benefit from the highest neural plasticity. Our results might also explain why numerous academic curricula, even in ancient civilizations, propose to teach reading around seven years&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; is known for its multi- and interdisciplinary approach. The journal is open for papers in all areas of science. From particle physics to pulmonology, we particularly welcome papers that break down barriers between disciplines. Historically speaking, however, most of our initiatives and publications have focused on biomedical topics. Given that all of PLOS’ founders came from biomedical fields, this focus arose organically. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;But &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; approach to consider all rigorous research irrespective of impact and PLOS’ commitment to driving innovations in Open Science and Open Access in a non-profit framework have always attracted a diverse group of researchers and disciplines. Indeed, communities in physics, chemistry, earth sciences, computer sciences and engineering have adopted &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; as an outlet of choice in the past. We have published influential papers on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0059613%20&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;complex networks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049365&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;3D printing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133088&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;polymer chemistry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;climate change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134254&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;machine learning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, to name but a few topics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To build on these strengths, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;has created a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Physical Sciences and Engineering team &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2018/02/26/towards-our-next-10-years/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;as part of a wider effort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; to better serve our communities through subject-specific in-house editorial groups. The team is led by me, Division Editor Leonie Mueck (Physics, Computer Science, Engineering). I am proud to present the team working beside me:   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;You can meet us at many 2018 conferences, including the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/national-meeting.html?sc=meetings_170416_mtg_BO18_od&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;ACS National Meeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macro18.org/&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;MACRO2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goldschmidt.info/2018/&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Goldschmidt2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mrs.org/fall2018&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;2018 MRS Fall Meeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fallmeeting.agu.org/2018/welcome/&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;2018 AGU Fall Meeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netsci2018.com/&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;NetSci 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Physical Sciences and Engineering is a vast remit and we are building an experienced editorial board in the different research fields, an editorial family which you are invited to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/join-editorial-board&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;join &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;as an Academic Editor. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;is a journal that is run by the community for the community, and we invite researchers in the field to join us in our efforts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Together with some of these communities, we have already started working on various editorial projects: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In consultation with new and veteran editorial board members, we have launched two Calls for Papers, in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2018/03/09/call-for-papers-ml4health/&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Machine Learning in Health and Biomedicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2018/03/02/call-for-papers-quantum/&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;in Open Quantum Computation and Simulation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, for which we expect authors to share their source code as well as their data. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;On 25 April, 10-11am Pacific Daylight Time, we will be discussing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2018/04/18/stop-hiding-your-code/&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;why and how researchers should share their code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; on Twitter using the hashtag #ShareYourCode and invite everyone to join. Connect with me on twitter @LeonieMueck if you are active on social media.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To support the younger generation of scientists in these disciplines we have recently launched the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/onetravelaward&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Early Career Researcher Travel Award&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; in the Physical Sciences. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In the PLOS Channel “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/rtcc&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Responding to Climate Change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;”, one of our Section Editors and his colleagues are curating an interdisciplinary community resource on climate change. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Going forward, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;new website design&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; will help in showcasing content from the different Physical Sciences and Engineering disciplines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence is a concept that some people have a hard time buying. It’s too multifaceted, too context-dependent, too Western. The US psychologist Edwin Boring encapsulated this scepticism when he said “measurable intelligence is simply what the tests of intelligence test.” Yet the scientific credentials of the concept are undimmed, partly because intelligence is strongly associated with so many important outcomes in life. Now Utah Valley University researchers Russell Warne and Cassidy Burningham have released evidence that further strengthens the case for intelligence being a valid and useful concept. Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/uv673/&quot;&gt;PsyArXiv pre-print&lt;/a&gt; presents a cross-study analysis suggesting a single intelligence-like factor underpins mental performance across a wide range of non-western cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33750&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to work pioneered by Charles Spearman, we know that in Western populations performance on a range of mental tasks seems to reflect a more basic mental ability, a “general intelligence” or simply &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t see &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; – it’s a statistical reality more than anything else, but it’s very robust, and modern research suggests that the &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; factor accounts for roughly half the variability in performance within and between people on all kinds of mental tests. Being strong verbally doesn’t guarantee you will be mathematical too, but it tips the odds strongly in your favour.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s conceivable that &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; is not culturally universal – after all, there are many countries, especially non-Western, where relatively greater value is placed on the social and emotional aspects of intelligent behaviour (and where these non-cognitive skills are more closely tied to a successful life) – for instance, in Zimbabwe it is considered socially intelligent to prioritise caring for your relatives over friends or strangers. Also, people from different cultures performing the same task will often tackle it in a different way: past research found that Zambian children struggled in a traditional expression task using pen and paper, but were talented clay-moulders, for example. Could these cultural variations in behaviour and in the conception of what is &lt;em&gt;considered&lt;/em&gt; smart reflect fundamental differences in how minds work?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out, Warne and Burningham searched the literature to find mental ability studies in non-industrialised, non-Western cultures (defined as less than half the population being White or European). They selected datasets that included participant results on four or more cognitive tasks so that it was possible to perform a “factor analysis” to identify how many factors seemed to be driving variation in performance across the different tests. Mostly there were standard intelligence measures, but also other types of test, including Piagetian development tasks, and tests designed to be specific to the cultural conditions, such as children’s willingness to interact with unfamiliar toys after seeing them used.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis covered nearly 100 datasets from 31 cultures including Thailand, Uganda, Papau New Guinea, Guyana – from every inhabited continent and world region save Europe and Australia. The median sample size was 150, but due to some very large samples Warne and Burningham were working with 50,000 participants in all. They wanted to explore which cultures and which sets of tasks featured performance variation that could be reduced down to one factor akin to &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;, and which would firmly resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to do factor analysis, especially around the decision rule of when to stop generating underlying factors, and this choice obviously influences the results that follow. Warne and Burningham argue that they chose rules that are deemed the most accurate in these sorts of circumstances, and they ran the analysis with two versions of the decision rule for safety, but it’s worth noting that others may disagree and to remember that this study is a pre-print so it has not yet been subjected to peer review.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Warne and Burningham’s rules, between three quarters and four-fifths of the datasets immediately yielded just one factor that explained variability in participants’ performance across different tests. In other cases, two underlying factors emerged, but these were similar enough to also end up reducing to one factor in a second round of analysis, saving one single exception.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, reducing variation in test performance to a general factor in dataset after dataset doesn’t mean that it must be the same general factor for all datasets, but it’s an obvious explanation. More so when you note that, on average, the first factor extracted explained almost half of the variance in performance across different tests – very similar to the &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; research in Western samples. Warne and Burningham state they “are astonished at the uniformity of these results” – given the wide variety of sample sizes, test content, and cultural locations.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This adds more evidence for &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;, which we know from previous research correlates with brain size, white matter tract integrity, genetic markers, and also seems to explain mental performance differences in other mammals, from primates to mice. The authors close by doubting whether we will ever solve the disagreement about what the culturally loaded term “intelligence” means worldwide. But we can still do the work to identify properties of the mind that are common to us all, and shape our ability to act in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/iStock-490362470-e1524488762527-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the current debate surrounding vaccination in the US centers on parental rights and whether parents should be compelled to vaccinate their children. Hesitancy towards vaccines is not a new phenomenon in the US or elsewhere around the world. Since vaccines were introduced, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/history-anti-vaccination-movements&quot;&gt;there has been a subset of the population opposed to them (for a variety of reasons)&lt;/a&gt;. Modern vaccine hesitancy can likely be traced back to, at least partially, the now debunked research linking the Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine with autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there is no federal-level mechanism to compel vaccination, states are responsible for enacting and enforcing their own policies and regulations. Currently, all states except Mississippi, West Virginia, and California provide vaccine hesitant parents with an option to exempt their children from school-entry vaccine requirements for non-medical reasons. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/vaccinations.html&quot;&gt;Although the details and restrictiveness vary from state to state&lt;/a&gt;, non-medical exemptions can be obtained based on parents’ religious, personal, or philosophical beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A self-reinforcing process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case the refusal of vaccines, operated in a manner similar to a contagious disease, geographically spreading from parent to parent or community to community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We examined how the use of non-medical exemptions changed over a 14-year period in California, a time in which non-medical exemption use more than quadrupled (to over 3% of all incoming kindergarteners in 2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a health geographer, I was very interested in understanding whether vaccine-related behavior, in this case the refusal of vaccines, operated in a manner similar to a contagious disease, geographically spreading from parent to parent or community to community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We examined how the geographic patterns of non-medical exemption use evolved from 2000 to 2013, as there were no policy changes that would potentially affect parents’ behavior during this time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, we found evidence of a contagious-like process operating over this time period, as increases in the use of non-medical exemptions appeared to emanate from the initial high use regions over time. Furthermore, we observed that regions with the highest use of non-medical exemptions early in the study period also had the largest increases in use over this time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second finding suggests that vaccine refusal is a self-reinforcing process, e.g., the more people that refuse vaccination in a region, the more acceptable it becomes. These findings are useful to better understand how vaccine refusal can progress from a behavior that is uncommon into one that is largely-accepted (and maybe even expected) in some communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminating non-medical exemptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the focus of our research, we did not examine the recent policy changes in California. The state implemented two new laws regarding non-medical exemptions after our study period. &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120AB2109&quot;&gt;AB2109&lt;/a&gt; was implemented prior to the 2014-15 school year, requiring parents to receive counseling from a health care provider prior to obtaining a non-medical exemption. &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB277&quot;&gt;SB277&lt;/a&gt; was implemented prior to the 2016-17 school year and eliminated the non-medical exemption provision entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While SB277 will ultimately increase vaccination rates in California’s schools, the law contained a “Grandfather clause” that allowed students already in school with a valid non-medical exemption to continue attending. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953616304336?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;This will ultimately delay the law’s intended effect&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, in the first year the law was in force, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2652640&quot;&gt;medical exemptions more than tripled in incoming kindergarteners&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While California took the bold step of eliminating the non-medical exemption option, other states have yet to follow suit. With the use of non-medical exemptions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6640a3.htm&quot;&gt;continuing to rise in many states&lt;/a&gt;, we will likely continue to observe reports of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks,  such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wral.com/whooping-cough-outbreak-impacts-chapel-hill-schools/17281082/&quot;&gt;whooping cough&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/kansas/articles/2018-04-17/measles-outbreak-that-started-in-kansas-day-care-grows-to-16&quot;&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/37796779/mumps-outbreak-in-hawaii-nears-1000-cases&quot;&gt;mumps&lt;/a&gt; (and the list goes on).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/adoption-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has found that, compared with the general population, adoption is associated with increased rates of both all-cause mortality and of specific causes of death, such as infections, vascular disease and cancer as well as alcohol-related deaths and suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to explore long-term consequences of the age at transfer of adoptees into a new family, the authors of a study published today in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; have looked at mortality rates and cause-specific mortality rates in 10,592 Danish adoptees according to age at transfer. The researchers, based at Aarhus University and the University of Copenhagen, also set out to assess if the social class of the adoptive family modified the effects of age at transfer to the adoptive family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortality rates among adoptees were compared according to the age at which the adoptee was transferred to the adoptive family, using those who were transferred immediately after birth as a reference. For the purpose of this study, the social class of the adoptive family was based on occupation of the fathers, and was available from the adoption records for 96% of the adoptive fathers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that death rates from all causes were significantly higher in those transferred between age 1 month and 4 years compared to those transferred immediately after birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the main analyses, adoptees were divided into six groups according to their age at the time of transfer to the adoptive parents: 0 months, 1-5 months, 6-11 months, 12-23 months, 2-3 years, and 4-7 years. The social class of the adoptive family was considered a factor potentially modifying the effects of age at transfer and was categorized into high and low social class. High social class included advanced professional, academic and sub-academic professions and self-employed, while low social class included subordinate clerks, skilled workers, semi-skilled workers, and unskilled workers. In the analyses including the potential modifying effect of paternal social class, age at transfer was reduced to four categories: 0 months, 1-5 months, 6-23 months, and 2-7 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that death rates from all causes were significantly higher in those transferred between age 1 month and 4 years compared to those transferred immediately after birth with the relative rate peaking for those transferred between 6 and 11 months. Death rates from natural causes were higher in those transferred between 1 month to 2 years of age. The later the age of transfer, the higher the rate of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, transfer into an adoptive family later than at time of birth may have long-term consequences affecting overall and cause-specific mortality. These effects were, to the researchers’ surprise, not modified by the environment provided by the adoptive family as indicated by the social class of these families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the study is observational with limited information at baseline, it is of course difficult to make counterfactual inferences about what would have happened to the children if they had not been adopted away and transferred to the adoptive family at a certain age. The conclusions from the study are based only on the comparisons of adoptees with different ages at transfer to the adoptive families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johannes Eichstaedt was sitting in a coffee shop by Lake Atitlan in Guatemala when he received a slack about a tweet about a preprint. In 2015, the University of Pennsylvania psychologist and his colleagues published a headline-grabbing &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614557867&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; linking heart disease to the language used on Twitter. They’d found that tweets emanating from US counties with high rates of heart disease mortality tended to exhibit high levels of negative emotions such as anger, anxiety, disengagement, aggression, and hate. The study, published in &lt;i&gt;Psychological Science,&lt;/i&gt; has proven influential, already accruing over 170 citations. But three years later, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/dursw/&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt; authors Nick Brown and James Coyne from the University of Groningen claimed to have identified “numerous conceptual and methodological limitations”. Within the month, Eichstaedt and his colleagues issued a riposte, publishing their own &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/p75ku/&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt; that claims &lt;i&gt;further&lt;/i&gt; evidence to support their original conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As recent revelations surrounding Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have highlighted, corporations and political organisations attach a high value to social media data. But, Eichstaedt &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/using-social-media-to-assess-health-from-afar/&quot;&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt;, that same data also offers rich insights into psychological health and well-being. With appropriate ethical oversight, social media analytics could promote population health and perhaps even save lives. That at least is its promise. But with big data come new challenges – as Eichstaedt’s “debate” with Brown and Coyne illustrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-33742&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2015, Nick Brown was discharged from hospital. Getting his teeth into Eichstaedt’s paper was, as he put it, “my way of picking myself up.” In recent years, Brown has developed a reputation for uncovering irregularities in published research. His investigations into the work of Cornell food scientist Brian Wansink have contributed (at the time of writing) to &lt;a href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/19/caught-our-notice-retraction-eight-as-errors-in-wansink-paper-are-too-voluminous-for-a-correction/&quot;&gt;8 retractions and 15 corrections&lt;/a&gt;. But, as Brown stresses, the discussion of Eichstaedt’s paper is very different. His concern is simply that the study has been oversold. “People who might be thinking of using social media for public health need to be aware of the counter arguments,” Brown says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central claim in Eichstaedt’s 2015 paper is that Twitter data can provide new information about heart disease that is not available from other measures. The analysis began with 148 million tweets, written between 2009 and 2010 and geo-tagged to US counties based on the tweeter’s user profile. Each tweet was scored according to multiple emotion “variables” by comparing its constituent words against pre-specified lists of words related to that emotion. Information from a subset of counties was then fed into a machine-learning algorithm – a computer program that worked out the combination of Twitter variables providing the closest fit to the heart disease data. When tested on the remaining counties, the Twitter model predicted heart disease rates more accurately than did similar models based on conventional measures such as a county’s racial demographics, the income and education levels of its residents, and rates of smoking and obesity. This, according to the accompanying &lt;a href=&quot;https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/twitter-can-predict-rates-coronary-heart-disease-according-penn-research&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, shows that “tweets are aggregating information about people that can’t be readily accessed in other ways.” Twitter analysis “could be used to marshal evidence of the effectiveness of public-health interventions on the community”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown, however, is sceptical. His preprint lists numerous sources of bias and noise that would make it hard to find a genuine heart disease signal in the Twitter noise. Words can have multiple meanings depending on the context. Twitter data are unrepresentative of the population – and users who tag their locations may not represent the wider Twitter user base. In counties with small populations, the data may be dominated by a small number of prolific users. And tweets with certain racial terms – often used in a hostile fashion – appear to have been censored by Twitter prior to their release to researchers. There is noise too in the health records – autopsies are rarely carried out to establish cause of death and so variation in reported heart disease rates partly reflect variation in reporting practices. &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his part, Eichstaedt acknowledges that the data are noisy and in some ways biased. But, he says, the salient point is that they still found a signal. And their preprint responding to Brown and Coyne includes a new analysis of a larger and more recent sample of Twitter data, which again outperforms a model based on traditional demographic measures.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps there is a signal,” Brown acknowledges. “But there’s an awful lot of wrongness.” And, he adds, the fact that Twitter predicts heart disease better than other measures is “in some way irrelevant” because the best predictor of a community’s future heart disease rate is its current heart disease rate. This, Eichstaedt says, is “trivially true” for most outcomes with complex underlying causes. But prediction in itself was not the goal. “We are trying to use Twitter as a source of epidemiological insight,” he says. The first step is to show that there is a signal. The next step is to work out what it means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When his paper was published in 2015, Eichstaedt’s findings made &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeichstaedt.com/heart-disease-press/&quot;&gt;headlines&lt;/a&gt; around the world. “Angry Tweeting could increase your risk of heart disease” said the UK’s Telegraph. CBS News led with “Cheerful tweets may mean a healthier heart”. The association between Twitter language and heart disease has an intuitive appeal. As Brown notes, it speaks to the notion of a “Type A” personality – permanently uptight, angry at the world, and (according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3477961/&quot;&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt; research) more prone to heart disease. But in their paper, Eichstaedt and colleagues were clear.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;“Obviously the people tweeting are not the people dying,” they wrote. Instead, they suggested, the sentiments expressed in tweets may reflect characteristics of the communities to which tweeters and heart disease sufferers belong – their “shared economic, physical, and psychological environment”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown describes this as “pure speculation”. But it’s a testable idea. If Twitter language really does measure the psychological profile of a community then it should predict mental health even better than it predicts physical health. Adapting Eichstaedt’s methods, Brown and Coyne used Twitter language to try and predict deaths from suicide instead of heart disease. They found significant correlations but in the “wrong” direction. Counties with higher rates of suicide had relatively fewer tweets containing anger, negative emotions and negative relationships and more tweets about nature, romantic love, and positive social relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eichstaedt, however, is unperturbed by this finding. “Suicide is a weird variable,” he says. It’s much rarer than heart disease or cancer, for example, and rates are typically much higher in rural communities, perhaps due to social isolation and higher rates of gun ownership. In their response to Brown and Coyne, Eichstaedt and his team report that a county’s suicide rate correlates with its altitude above sea level and the percentage of people living in rural areas. When they controlled for these two measures, the correlations between suicide and Twitter language disappeared.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better direct measure of community mental health, Eichstaedt argues, is a survey report of “mentally unhealthy days”, which he and his colleagues have found to correlate with Twitter language in the expected direction. In fact, Eichstaedt notes, the pattern is very similar to that for heart disease. The question then is whether Twitter data can distinguish between heart disease and other conditions. Or does it reflect some underlying factor that relates to most diseases?&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;“The jury is still out on this,” Eichstaedt admits. “We haven’t cracked that nut.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For psychology researchers, often criticised for their small sample sizes and the questionable relevance of their studies to everyday life, the appeal of social media data is obvious. But the price of big data is a loss of experimental control and the ability to tease apart cause and effect. There’s also a loss of transparency. The complex analytic procedures represent a serious challenge for psychologists attempting to understand and evaluate a study. “It becomes,” says Brown, “a question of do I trust your software?”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eichstaedt, a physicist by training, is sympathetic to this view. “When you get super fancy and the reviewers can’t follow you any more and have to take you on faith, that’s problematic,” he says. “It’s hacking science.” The solution, Brown argues, may be to move away from traditional journals and peer review. “It has to become some sort of ongoing process,” he says. In a “better world” Eichstaedt’s paper would itself have been posted as a preprint and Brown’s critique could have been part of the post-publication review process. This scenario is similar to the approach adopted in physics where preprints and responses have long been the mainstay of scientific communication.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet it’s clear that a similar culture shift in psychology will come with its own teething troubles and questions of etiquette. In Brown’s view, the original Eichstaedt paper was badged as “open science” so there should have been no need to seek further information from the authors. He decided not to contact them as a matter of principle. Eichstaedt, however, notes that a more collaborative approach would have allowed him to quickly address some misconceptions about the research and direct Brown and Coyne to analysis code that wasn’t available at the time of publication. “I think that would have been a much less painful way of getting to the same point”. Still, the exchange has provided an opportunity for his team to clarify some issues and make it easier for anyone in the field to replicate and adapt their analyses. “Probably an older wiser version of me will only see that positive side,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

 A new paper from MIT neuroscientists Sharon Gilad-Gutnick and colleagues reveals that we are remarkably good at recognizing faces even if they are highly distorted. Not only is this scientifically interesting, the deformed images used in this study are rather hilarious.



Here's an example of a face being distorted by horizontal and vertical compression (also known as thinning and flattening). The unfortunate victim of these distortions is Bill Clinton:

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Heroin_powder&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/Heroin_powder-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Animal models of addiction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several animal models are used to study drug dependence in which self-administration has obvious advantages. The first benefit of self-administration is that it provides the most direct point-to-point correspondence with addictive behaviors that are found in people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical self-administration procedure in animals includes acquisition, extinction / abstinence and reinforcement. During the acquisition stage, animals undergo operant conditioning and learn to perform one action, typically a lever press, in order to receive a drug. Once a specific criterion is obtained, animals are regarded as addicted to a drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_10091&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10091 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;206&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/Rat-self-adminsitration-300x206.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Rat self-administration chamber with catheter implanted in the jugular vein&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;Picture provided with permission by Zhang Fuqiang from Ningbo Institute of Drug Treatment&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intravenous administration via catheterization is an optimal method for self-administration in that it maximizes drug bioavailability and has rapid onset. Humans suffering from addiction often resort to intravenous drug use for similar reasons. This parallel provides further benefits of this route of administration in animal studies in that it increases the validity of the self-administration methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After acquisition, animals are returned to their home cage and resume normal living conditions. This process is similar to people undergoing abstinence in that they can’t acquire drugs while carrying out their everyday lives. In animal models, after 14 days of abstinence, reinforcement is induced by either administration of the drug or returning the animal to an environment associated with the drug. Both of these events are analogous to events that can trigger relapse in human drug abusers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relapse and metabolomics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12868-018-0404-5?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Neuroscience-Neurology-Global&amp;amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_APR2018_heroin_relapse&quot;&gt;In our study published in&lt;em&gt; BMC Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we set up an intravenous, heroin self-administration rat model and collected a serum sample during the reinforcement stage. As we want to get a complete picture that could reflect the status of this stage, we tried nuclear magnetic resonance based metabolomics analysis. Specifically, metabolomics is the “systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints that specific cellular processes leave behind”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, metabolomics is the “systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints that specific cellular processes leave behind”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results revealed that energy metabolism was greatly disturbed. An increase in glucose and decrease in intermediates of glycolysis and the TCA cycle indicate impairment in essential pathways for energy production. The finding that there was an increase in levels of 3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate suggest that energy production was activated from fatty acids. These types of changes in fatty acids have been correlated with relapse and potential neurological dysfunctions associated with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly phenylalanine, glutamine, and choline increased greatly. These molecules are precursors of the neurotransmitters γ-aminobutyric acid/glutamate, acetylcholine, and dopamine respectively. These neurotransmitters play an important role in learning and reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that when animals are re-exposed to a drug or a drug-associated environment the “happy memory” of the drug experience is awakened, and the compulsive drug seeking behavior reappears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that when animals are re-exposed to a drug or a drug-associated environment the “happy memory” of the drug experience is awakened, and the compulsive drug seeking behavior reappears. During this process, the increase of these three precursors of neurotransmitters in the circulatory system could partly explain why the motivation of drug seeking is so strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ultimate goal is to develop new therapies for drug addiction. The most challenging component is reducing the incidence of relapse. Although we don’t know whether the same changes would happen in humans with opiate addiction, the results found in our study remind us that more attention should be paid to the restoration of energy metabolism in addition to the neurotransmitters which have already received great concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

 Big news this week as Hans Asperger, autism pioneer and namesake of Asperger's syndrome, is accused of having collaborated in the murder of children during the Nazi rule in Austria. The accusations come in the form of a long paper by historian Herwig Czech in the journal Molecular Autism.



Czech presents an analysis of Asperger's activities as head of the Heilpädagogik Ward of the Pediatric Clinic at the University of Vienna, from 1935 to 1943. Here, Asperger was responsible for the evalua</content>
