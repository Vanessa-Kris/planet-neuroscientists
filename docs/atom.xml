 &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of interesting statistics you can do by scraping websites, whether it’s reading tables from Wikipedia, grabbing and aggregating climate change tables from government websites, or quantifying the exponential growth of covid-19 articles on Medium. Many of these pages will have easy-to-use methods to download the data in a develop-friendly format, for example CSV or JSON. For others, you’ll have to rely on scraping web pages, an ancient, dark art. In this article, I’ll introduce you to some of the tools of the trade to do so in Python.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Identifying targets with developer tools&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both Chrome and Firefox have developer tools (Shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+I). These tools allow you:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visualize the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS behind a webpage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;See the traffic between your browser and the internet, include late http requests triggered by JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Execute custom JavaScript that can read and modify the DOM of a webpage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify where a particular UI element is created in the page’s HTML&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These can help you identify which part of a page you need to scrape. Let’s say, for instance, that we want to find out how the top article of a major news website changes as a function of time during a time of crisis (as of now, covid-19). Perhaps we’ll want to retroactively run an analysis of the sentiment behind the headline, the focus (health, business, etc.), the frequency of updates, or of how these headers co-vary with numbers released by different governments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here I’ll use the New York Times as the example webpage. What we’d like is to grab, every half-hour, the title of the biggest headline. With developer tools, I can easily use the Picker tool (Ctrl+Shift+C) to highlight the biggest headline on the page.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7487&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7487&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;scraping&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;3070,1752&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/scraping/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here I find that the biggest headline is a &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; with a class name of &lt;code&gt;balancedHeadline&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s look at how we can grab this information with Selenium.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Selenium: remote control browsers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.selenium.dev/&quot;&gt;The method I’ll showcase here uses Selenium&lt;/a&gt;: we use a headless browser (that is, an instance of Firefox or Chrome that’s running “invisibly”) that navigates to the website we care about. Once on the webpage, we can inject javascript, simulate clicks or manipulate the DOM to get to the information we need. This is a rather heavyweight solution compared to, say, using &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html&quot;&gt;urllib&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to grab the data and parsing it with &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/&quot;&gt;BeautifulSoup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. However, the big advantage we get is that the headless browser actually runs the javascript on the page and loads all the extra assets – it’s literally like a person navigating to the website. Sometimes, it can be the only solution, especially if the information we need:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;is dynamically loaded&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;is hidden behind authentication layers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;requires emulating clicks and interacting with JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Python, we can easily install Selenium with:`&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;pip install selenium&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then we’ll need to install a WebDriver – this will allow your favorite web browser to be manipulated via Python. Here I installed the Firefox webdriver on the Ubuntu platform. &lt;a href=&quot;https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html&quot;&gt;I followed the instructions here on the Selenium website,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases&quot;&gt;downloading the gecko webdriver&lt;/a&gt; and extracting the binary to &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt;. You can check that you’ve done the installation by running a tiny bit of Python:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: python; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')

&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Running this code opens up Firefox and navigates to the website. Notice the unusual appearance of the browser: the url bar is a different color than usual, and there’s a robot icon next to the address.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-style-default&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7477&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7477&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;nytimes-robot&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;2176,192&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/nytimes-robot/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=723&quot; /&gt;A remote-controlled version of Firefox&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can grab the information in at least a couple of ways: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We could inject some Javascript into the page and use   &lt;code&gt;document.querySelectorAll(&quot;span.balancedHeadline&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; to grab the headline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We could read the DOM to find the right span&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s use the second method:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: python; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, &quot;balancedHeadline&quot;))
)
print(element.text)
driver.quit()
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Running headless and automating&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the explicit window is useful for debugging, if you want to run this script every half-hour, you’ll want to run this in a headless browser. A headless browser doesn’t display a window, so it won’t pop up over your other windowsand capture your inputs. In addition, we’ll want to save the data to disk, which we can easily accomplish like so:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options

options = Options()
options.headless = True

driver = webdriver.Firefox(options=options)
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, &quot;balancedHeadline&quot;))
)
with open('/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/top_news.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('&quot;' + str(datetime.datetime.now()) + '&quot;,&quot;' + element.text + '&quot;\n')
driver.quit()
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Cron job&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All that’s left now is to set up a cron job to run this script every 15 minutes. First, we’ll need a shell file. We could run python directly, but I installed selenium inside of a special conda environment called &lt;code&gt;headless-browser&lt;/code&gt;, so my shell file activates this environment before, like so:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: bash; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
source /home/pmin/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
conda activate headless-browser &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
python /home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.py
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I saved this file as &lt;code&gt;/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.sh&lt;/code&gt;. Running  &lt;code&gt;crontab -e&lt;/code&gt;, I added an entry that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;# m h  dom mon dow   command
*/15 * * * * /home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.sh 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 /var/log/grab-headline.log
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://crontab.guru/&quot;&gt;You can use this website&lt;/a&gt; to figure out what incantations to give to cron for different schedules. I also captured any output or error into an error log. If you don’t want to have to leave your computer on all the time to do this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/creating&quot;&gt;you can run cron jobs inside of a cloud service&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A final tweak we’ll need to deal with is authenticating. Sometimes the website we’re trying to scrape requires us to be logged in. It’s possible for the headless browser to use the same cookies and credentials as the regular browser you use. To do so, you need to locate the name of the default profile in Firefox. Locate a directory that finished with &lt;code&gt;.default&lt;/code&gt; with:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;ls ~/.mozilla/firefox/
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In my case, I found a directory called &lt;code&gt;lasd74g9.default&lt;/code&gt;. Putting everything together, here’s my final script:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: python; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;import datetime

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options

options = Options()
options.headless = True

profile = profile = webdriver.FirefoxProfile(profile_directory='/home/pmin/.mozilla/firefox/lasd74g9.default')
driver = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_profile=profile, options=options)
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, &quot;balancedHeadline&quot;))
)
with open('/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grim_news.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('&quot;' + str(datetime.datetime.now()) + '&quot;,&quot;' + element.text + '&quot;\n')
driver.quit()

&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine going to sit in a room with a violent, imprisoned psychopath and having a chat about what you both like to eat. (It’s impossible not to think of liver, fava beans and Chianti, isn’t it….?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what one researcher did recently in Germany. But the purpose of &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-17706-001&quot;&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt;, reported in &lt;em&gt;Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t to gather data on criminal psychopaths’ dining preferences, but rather on how they make — or don’t make — eye contact during a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first study to explore psychopaths’ eye movements in a naturalistic setting. And it reveals that prisoners who scored highly on one aspect of psychopathy, in particular, were much less likely to look at the interviewer’s eyes. This finding not only helps with understanding how psychopathy develops, but also suggests that finding ways to encourage at-risk children to make more eye contact might be a useful intervention, argue Nina Gehrer at the University of Tübingen and her colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39418&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The team studied 30 men who had been convicted of serious crimes (including murder, rape and hostage-taking) and who were incarcerated in two institutions in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One researcher led all the interactions, which were divided into talking and listening stages. For one minute, the participant listened while the researcher talked about one of three neutral topics (eating habits/food, job/work or typical daily routine). Then, after a brief exchange on the topic, the second stage began: the participant talked for about a minute on the same topic. This was then repeated for the other two topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout both stages, the experimenter maintained eye contact (this was later verified by two independent raters). And at all times, the prisoner wore an eye-tracking headset. This allowed the team to monitor where they were looking while they were listening and talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of the study, the team divided the face into two sections: the eyes and the philtrum (the nose and mouth region). They then examined whether time spent looking at the eyes or philtrum correlated with the participants’ scores on the PCL-R, a standard psychopathy assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychopathy is generally thought to have four facets, or components: manipulating other people, affective impairments (deficits in feeling emotion and empathy and in showing remorse or guilt), having an erratic lifestyle and demonstrating antisocial behaviour. Each of these is measured within the PCL-R. And the team found that during both listening and talking, prisoners with higher affective psychopathy scores made less eye contact. “These results are in line with previous research suggesting impaired attention to social cues in psychopathy,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current theories about how psychopathy develops assume that a failure to view important social cues (from the eyes, especially) is a key factor. For children who go on to be diagnosed with psychopathy, there’s evidence that emotion-related impairments emerge early, in the form of callous unemotional traits. There’s some evidence that young children who pay less attention to other people’s eyes are more likely to develop these traits, the researchers note. Now that this link has been found for adult, criminal psychopaths, this suggests that eye contact, or rather a lack of it, could be important for understanding the development of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations to the study, however. The number of participants was quite small, and all were men. The researchers themselves call for a replication before any firm conclusions can be drawn. It will also be important to investigate whether it’s possible to fix this particular deficit in eye contact, and, if so, whether that reduces the risk of developing emotion-related problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To date, evidence for lasting changes in eye gaze through social attention bias modification training is still elusive,” they note. “Thus, these promising approaches and further opportunities that target impaired eye contact need to be further investigated and enhanced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-17706-001?CheckAccess=1&quot;&gt;Eye contact during live social interaction in incarcerated psychopathic offenders.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A question has perplexed
public officials trying to curb the COVID-19 pandemic: How large of a group of
people is too large? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the spread of the
coronavirus has gathered speed, U.S. officials urged limits on large
gatherings, constantly scrambling to reduce the definition of “large.” First, meetings
of more than 1,000 were discouraged, then 250, 100, 50 and 10. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/#socialdistancing&quot;&gt;many states institute orders to stay at home&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;
nonessential gatherings are being banned. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But no scientific rationale has
been cited for any particular number. Getting the right answer is crucial. Too
large and you don’t control the epidemic. Too small, and people’s lives and
livelihoods may be upended, for insufficient social benefit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am not aware of any
quantitative modeling informing those decisions,” says Lydia Bourouiba, a
physicist and epidemiologist at MIT. “They weren’t based on events.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study is providing
one roadmap for coming up with an answer. There is no gathering size that can
eliminate all risk. But there is a threshold between curbing the epidemic and
having it spread like wildfire, and that number is most likely not zero, the
researchers conclude. The finding could have implications not only for slowing
the pandemic, but also for figuring out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-when-will-coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing-end&quot;&gt;how to eventually return to normal life&lt;/a&gt; without causing a new surge in cases (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/24/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the study, posted online
March 12 at arXiv.org, five epidemic modelers showed &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05924&quot;&gt;mathematically
how an epidemic can be controlled&lt;/a&gt; without
banning all get-togethers. Their model includes a version of the “friendship
paradox,” which says that your friends in a social network on average have more
friends than you. When an epidemic strikes such a network, large gatherings are
especially bad because they attract people who have more contacts than average
— and hence are more likely to already be infected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s possible to determine
the dividing line between an effective and an ineffective intervention, the
team found. In one hypothetical epidemic, if you banned gatherings larger than
30, the epidemic would rage on. But if you banned groups larger than 20, it
would eventually die out. The threshold of effectiveness, for this particular social
network model (one in which the friendship paradox was fairly strong), was 23.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“I’m confident that there is
a threshold,” says Laurent Hébert-Dufresne, a computer scientist at the University
of Vermont in Burlington who developed the model. “I don’t have confidence in
the exact number 23.” The threshold for COVID-19 is still unknown, and, he
adds, “the cutoff could be very population specific.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s significant, Bourouiba
says, is the idea of computing the size of the safe group, not the actual
number in this hypothetical case. A maximum gathering size of “23 leading to a
collapse of the epidemic has to be taken with a grain of salt,” she says. “But
the concept is important, because sheltering at home is not going to be
sustainable forever.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, public officials have
been reducing maximum allowed group size without any precise formula. “The
declining number of recommended people is a way of signaling that we are
getting more and more serious about the need to be socially distanced,” says
Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public
Health in Boston. “I’m not sure that there is a particular number that is
magical.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In part, the recommendations
are based on the idea that the risk of a large gathering increases as the
square of the gathering size. That is, a gathering that is 10 times larger will
offer 100 times more “transmission opportunities,” says Lipsitch. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But according to Hébert-Dufresne,
this rough calculation actually underestimates the danger of large meetings,
because of the friendship paradox. It also doesn’t take into account the
dynamics of the epidemic, which is precisely what creates the threshold between
large and small gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The model in the new study,
which hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed, represents gatherings as highly connected cliques,
in which all people present are exposed to all the others. Hébert-Dufresne, who
worked with colleagues from Université Laval in Quebec, compares an epidemic in
such a network to a bonfire. You need two things to build a fire: kindling,
which gets the first flame started, and larger branches, which transmit the
fire from place to place. In Hébert-Dufresne’s model, small gatherings form the
kindling, and large gatherings are the branches. To keep the fire from
spreading, you don’t need to remove the kindling — only
the branches. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Telling the difference between
kindling and branches is where the mathematical model comes in. The dividing
line between small groups and large groups depends on three factors: the disease
transmission rate, the distribution of clique sizes, and the distribution of
clique membership (how many cliques do highly social people belong to?).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right now, the last two numbers
are completely unknown, Hébert-Dufresne says. But with enough data on social
networks, it might be possible to figure them out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The people with vast network
knowledge are Google, Amazon, Apple, Twitter,” says Simon DeDeo, a professor of
decision science at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. “If I were the
government right now, I would fly out to Silicon Valley and get this data.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lauren Ancel Meyers, an
epidemiologist at the University of Texas at Austin, agrees: “I’ve written a
plea for sharing of geolocation and social media data,” she says. “We really
need a better understanding of how people move and come into contact with each
other in schools, workplaces and their everyday lives.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Hébert-Dufresne’s network is
far from being the last word. It ignores many other kinds of heterogeneity,
such as the age structure of the population (which is especially important for
COVID-19, as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-questions-covid19-symptoms-deaths-spread#mostrisk&quot;&gt;elderly are the most vulnerable&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN:
3/4/20&lt;/em&gt;)) and differences between cliques. “A school is different from a
factory,” says Bourouiba. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many other network models do
take into account these variables. Lipsitch, Meyers and others all work with
models that include a great deal more detail, going down to the level of
contacts between individuals. “You can incorporate an incredible amount of
detail,” Meyers says, “but then it takes many simulations to extract general
results.” And that can take a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The one developed by Hébert-Dufresne and his colleagues is comparatively simple, but unique in treating gathering size itself as a source of diversity. “Some people are doing more complex models, but just in terms of getting at the idea of a cutoff, it’s a powerful idea,” says Hébert-Dufresne.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/snack-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health bodies have suggested that tobacco-style HWLs should be considered for application to alcohol and high calorie snack products. However, evidence for their potential usefulness in these contexts &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/jt52m/&quot;&gt;is limited&lt;/a&gt;, with prior research typically focusing on sugary drinks, or using smaller or less representative samples. This led us to run two large-scale studies in general populations to examine the potential effectiveness and acceptability of image-and-text HWLs on alcohol and snack foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our studies &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two separate online studies we asked participants to rate different image-and-text HWLs on alcoholic drinks (Alcohol study, with 5,528 participants) and energy-dense snacks (Food study, with 4,618 participants). To take part, participants for the Alcohol study had to consume either beer or wine at least once a week, &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11822 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/alcohol-157x300.png&quot; width=&quot;157&quot; /&gt;and in the Food study participants consumed biscuits, cake, crisps or chocolate at least once a week, and liked chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants viewed and rated one of 21 image-and-text HWLs on alcoholic drinks or one of 18 image-and-text HWLs on high calorie snacks. Just like on cigarette packs, the HWLs showed an image of a disease relating to excess consumption of alcohol or high calorie snacks, alongside a text warning statement. For Alcohol the diseases depicted were bowel, breast, liver and non-specified cancers, heart disease, liver cirrhosis and liver disease, while for Food, the conditions were bowel and non-specified cancers, heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked how afraid, worried, uncomfortable or disgusted the label made them feel, and to rate their desire to consume the labelled product. They were also asked how strongly they supported putting the HWL on alcoholic drinks or high calorie snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-11812&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/alcohol-200x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;Alcohol study: we found that HWLs on alcoholic drinks depicting bowel cancer were associated with the highest level of negative emotional arousal and the lowest desire to consume the product. They were also considered the least acceptable for use by participants. In general, few of the alcohol HWLs were considered acceptable, with only three out of 21 rated at least somewhat acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food study: HWLs on high-density snacks depicting bowel cancer, followed by those depicting non-specific cancer, were associated with the highest level of negative emotional arousal and lowest desire to consume the product, with those depicting bowel cancer again considered to be the least acceptable. HWLs on energy-dense snacks were judged on average more acceptable than those on alcohol, with 13 out of 18 snack HWLs rated as at least somewhat acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also conducted a content analysis of free-text comments that some participants provided at the end of the study. Two key themes emerged– the acceptability of HWLs on these products, and their perceived effectiveness. Within these themes, comments touched on several pertinent issues, including the believability of the labels, whether people would avoid looking at them or become desensitized to them, whether they were appropriate to use, and whether participants thought they would affect their thoughts or behaviours in relation to these products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, while a wide range of views were expressed, the majority of responses expressed negative views of the possible use of such labels. It is plausible, however, that those who chose to leave a comment at the end of the study were those with more extreme opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are our results surprising?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of potential effectiveness, we found that for both alcoholic drinks and high calorie snacks, HWLs describing bowel cancer evoked the strongest negative emotional reactions and resulted in the lowest desire to consume the product they were applied to. This is consistent with previous research on alcohol labeling which has found bowel-cancer HWLs to be particularly effective. It is notable that this is similarly the case in the context of snack foods, where to our knowledge these warnings have not been tested before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;HWLs describing bowel cancer evoked the strongest negative emotional reactions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11817 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/choc-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;The finding that HWLs may be judged to be relatively more acceptable to use on snack foods than on alcohol could appear surprising. This could be due to heightened public awareness of the health consequences of excess energy intake and obesity, particularly in children. The content analysis (albeit based on a small subset of participants) suggested a mainly negative reaction to these labels on these products. Again, this is perhaps not surprising given that the study sample were people who regularly consumed the target products, and interventions which affect us directly are usually less supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that labels depicting bowel cancer may have the greatest potential for reducing alcohol and snack food selection and consumption. However, while bowel cancer HWLs had the greatest impact on people, they were also rated as the least acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study could not, however, demonstrate whether these labels are likely effective in actually changing behavior. The studies did not include a measure of actual behavior, and there was no control group to compare against. The studies were also conducted online and responses may differ when HWLs are applied to physical products in real-world settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further experimental studies are now needed to directly assess the potential effectiveness of health warning labels to reduce selection and consumption of &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/rv2p6/&quot;&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/zyca2/&quot;&gt;energy-dense snacks&lt;/a&gt;. Studies in field and naturalistic laboratory settings will enable us to examine whether these labels are likely to be effective in real-world settings.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Anna Dumituru and Alex May will talk about their project named &quot;Cyberspecies Proximity&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyberspecies Proximity explores what it will mean to share our sidewalks, elevators and transport systems in close proximity with mobile intelligent robots. The work challenges audiences to confront the technological, ethical, and societal questions raised by the advent of urban socially-aware robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robotic artwork combines the way-finding technologies of delivery and maintenance robots with an ability to communicate non-verbally, and to manipulate our emotions through body-language. The robot is able to move around an exhibition space using a predefined map created using SLAM technology. It reacts and responds to the body language of audience members through a multi-layered face, skeleton and movement tracking algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small and fragile humanoid form is dressed in the clothes of a worker, its frail and insignificant body reminds us of the social groups that will be most affected by future automation. The robot’s head and hands are made from 3D printed grey PLA and it intentionally avoids categorisations of race and gender. The project forces us to consider issues of ownership of public spaces as well as the broader ethical implications of how we design robots and behave towards them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyberspecies Proximity is a project by Anna Dumitriu and Alex May, created in collaboration with the Human Robot Co-Mobility Project of the New Technologies Team at Schindler. The project was supported by a Vertigo STARTS Residency, and the artwork was programmed in C++ and FUGIO, the Open Source Visual Programming System created by Alex May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTICE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to current unusual circumstances, this Journal Club will be held online as a conference on 8COM0108-0000-2019 module. In order to attend, you must be a member of that module. The conference room will be created on Friday and all of the module members will be notified about that with an email. Once the conference is created and started, module members will be able to join it by visiting the module website on Canvas, and then selecting &quot;Conferences&quot; section. Any queries should be directed to Emil Dmitruk via email (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:e.dmitruk@herts.ac.uk&quot;&gt;e.dmitruk@herts.ac.uk&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line-block&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rainforest-antarctica-south-pole-roughly-90-million-years-ago"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3086588</id>
		<updated>2020-04-01T21:36:48+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, there was
a swampy rainforest near the bottom of the world. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Buried sediment extracted
from the seafloor off West Antarctica contains ancient pollen, fossilized roots
and other chemical evidence of a diverse forest that flourished millions of
years ago, less than a thousand kilometers from the South Pole.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sediment offers the southernmost glimpse yet into just how warm Earth was during the mid-Cretaceous Period, between 92 million and 83 million years ago. By analyzing traces of vegetation in the sediment, researchers reconstructed climate conditions at the site. Average annual temperatures in the forest were about 13° Celsius, with summertime temperatures reaching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2148-5&quot;&gt;as high as 20° or 25° C&lt;/a&gt;, the team reports in the April 2 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mid-Cretaceous is known to have been one of the
warmest periods on Earth in the last 140 million years, based on analyses of
fossils and sediment collected from the seafloor closer to the equator. Atmospheric
carbon dioxide levels are thought to have been at least 1,000 parts per
million. (Today’s atmospheric carbon dioxide levels &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide&quot;&gt;average around
407 ppm&lt;/a&gt;, the highest in the last 800,000 years.)&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But for a forest to thrive so far south, even more
potent greenhouse conditions must have existed than previously thought, with atmospheric
carbon dioxide levels between 1,120 and 1,680 ppm, says marine geologist Johann
Klages. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It shows us the extreme potency of carbon dioxide — what
carbon dioxide can really do,” says Klages, of the Alfred Wegener Institute in
Bremerhaven, Germany. “Even without light for four months, [Antarctica] could
still have a temperate climate.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team retrieved the 30-meter-long core from within
the Amundsen Sea Embayment, where today &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-climate-change-models-disagree-earth-worst-case-scenarios&quot;&gt;fast-melting
Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers&lt;/a&gt; drain into the sea (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/7/20&lt;/em&gt;). Even before analyzing the
core, Klages says, the researchers knew it was special: The bottom three meters
of sediment, corresponding in time to the mid-Cretaceous Period, showed traces
of roots. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen many cores from Antarctica, but we’ve never
seen anything like that,” Klages says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;researchers with a sediment core&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3086590&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/040120_cg_antarctica_forest_inline_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3086590&quot;&gt;Researchers led by Johann Klages (right) analyzed seafloor sediment from off the coast of West Antarctica. Analyses of one sediment core revealed a dense network of roots as well as pollen, spores and other chemical traces of freshwater plants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3086590&quot;&gt;Thomas Ronge/Alfred Wegener Institute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pollen in the core suggested that this soggy, ancient
forest was home to conifers, ferns and flowering shrubs, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microbial-mats-may-have-given-early-animals-breathing-room&quot;&gt;mats of bacteria&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/16/11&lt;/em&gt;). Sediment analyses showed
no traces of salt, suggesting it was a freshwater swamp. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The forest data are also strong evidence that
Antarctica was largely ice-free during the mid-Cretaceous, Klages says. High
carbon dioxide alone wouldn’t have been enough to keep temperatures balmy so
close to the pole. If a bright white ice sheet were present, for example, it
would have reflected much of the incoming sunlight back into space, keeping the
land cold. But vegetative cover has the opposite effect, absorbing more solar
heat and amplifying greenhouse warming. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study represents “an unambiguous record of not
just warmer conditions, but a diverse forest flora” at the South Pole, says Julia
Wellner, a geologist at the University of Houston. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This paper is a great reminder that, just because
there [is] a continent sitting at the South Pole, [that] doesn’t mean it
necessarily has to have ice everywhere, or even be particularly cold,” Wellner
says.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for what significance, if any, this finding might
have to modern climate change, and Antarctica’s melting glaciers, Wellner notes
that it is difficult to make direct parallels. Today’s atmospheric carbon
dioxide levels are well below mid-Cretaceous levels, but climbing. And continental
landmasses have moved over millions of years — pushed and pulled by Earth’s
shifting tectonic plates — leading, in part, to ocean and atmospheric
circulation patterns that differ from those of the deep past. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study does highlight the powerful role of different
feedbacks, such as the presence or absence of ice cover, to the overall climate,
Wellner says. What role such feedbacks might play in the future is not yet
clear. The current, existing Antarctic ice sheet, for example, could
theoretically temper runaway greenhouse warming, even as carbon dioxide
continues to accumulate in the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Klages agrees. “Ice present
on the planet is a big gift,” he says. “And [we] should do everything we can to
keep it.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-control-measures-impact-global-death-toll"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3086576</id>
		<updated>2020-04-01T20:40:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;When the
U.S. White House coronavirus task force announced that social distancing needed
to continue through April, it cited a stark death toll: As many as 240,000
Americans could die from COVID-19 even with efforts to mitigate its spread. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As
horrific as those numbers are, it could be a lot worse. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first global assessment of the impact of the coronavirus, researchers at Imperial College London estimate that if governments weren’t taking any actions, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-12-global-impact-covid-19/&quot;&gt;coronavirus would infect an estimated 7 billion people in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 90 percent of people on Earth. Roughly 40 million would die and no health care system anywhere would be able to keep up. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Already,
countries are curbing that worst-case scenario, racing to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-pandemic-limit-spread-social-distancing-travel-bans&quot;&gt;implement strategies to drastically reduce&lt;/a&gt; the rapid growth of new cases (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/13/20&lt;/em&gt;). Even so, the virus could hit
various countries differently, depending on their demographics and income levels,
the new study suggests. And delays to put such strategies in place may put millions
of lives at risk. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;By analyzing disease
severity and how people interact, the team projected how the growing pandemic
might affect 202 countries. The global look builds on the team’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-when-will-coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing-end&quot;&gt;previous work that calculated the virus’s impact on the
United States&lt;/a&gt; and the United
Kingdom (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/24/20&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Slowing the virus’ spread
will save millions of lives worldwide, the team reports March 26 in a research
update released through Imperial College London. But differences among high
income and low income countries could mean the pandemic might follow a
different pattern, and take a different toll, in these areas. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a very complex
problem and [members of the Imperial College team] have captured a lot of that
complexity,” says Julie Swann, a systems engineer at North Carolina State
University in Raleigh. “This is continued evidence that interventions are
necessary to slow the disease spread and reduce deaths in the population.” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;The big picture&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The analysis found that social
distancing tactics to mitigate the outbreak — including
people decreasing social interactions by 40 percent or those above age 70
reducing contact by 60 percent — halved the number of estimated deaths to
approximately 20 million in 2020. Hospitals, though, would still be overwhelmed
with cases. That’s already happening in hard-hit places like parts of Italy and
New York City. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is still much we
don’t know about this disease,” Swann says. “So, it’s difficult to put full
stock in a specific numerical projection.” But other estimates agree that as
the virus spreads, it will have a big impact on countries around the globe and result
in a major loss of life, she says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Suppression strategies — which rely
on high levels of testing, contact tracing, patient isolation as well as social
distancing — would cut global deaths to approximately 2 million to 10 million,
the study estimates. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Acting early, when the number of
deaths in a population is still relatively low, is key. The tally of COVID-19 deaths can help officials
better understand how widespread the disease is and determine when to begin
advising residents to limit contact with other people or stay home. (Using
testing to catch where the disease is spreading even earlier would be better,
but “testing is not widespread in places,” Swann notes.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Global deaths could be kept to around
10 million, saving an estimated 30.7 million lives in total, if officials in
all countries begin suppressing the coronavirus’ spread when there are 1.6
COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people, the team found. Acting when deaths are much
lower — 0.2 deaths per 100,000 people — could save an additional 8 million more
people. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of April 1, the United States has on
average approximately 1.4 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people. New York City, currently
the hardest hit city in the country, has about 13.2 deaths per 100,000. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Delays in implementing strategies to
suppress transmission will lead to worse outcomes and fewer lives saved,” the
authors write in the report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Zooming in&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to different countries,
those with higher incomes could face a higher death burden than those with
lower incomes, the team found. That’s in part because their populations skew
older. People above age 65 face a higher risk for severe COVID-19 symptoms, as
do those with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-some-heart-patients-especially-vulnerable&quot;&gt;underlying health conditions like hypertension&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN:
3/20/20&lt;/em&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Because populations in
low-income settings tend to be younger, on average, it’s possible that there
may be a lower impact in terms of mortality,” says Virginia Pitzer, an
epidemiologist at Yale University who wasn’t involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the estimates don’t take
underlying conditions, such as other infectious diseases, into account or lower
health-care capacity in these regions, Pitzer says. So the true scope of the
COVID-19 pandemic in places like Uganda or Kenya could be higher than
projected. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And younger people aren’t
invulnerable to the disease. A recent report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention found that U.S. adults ages 20 to 44, for instance, are also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-young-adults-can-face-severe-cases&quot;&gt;being hospitalized with severe cases of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, although it’s unclear whether patients had
other conditions that would put them at higher risk (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/19/20&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Household size is another
variable that could affect COVID-19’s impact. For instance, older people in lower-income
countries tend to live in larger households, so they may be at higher risk for
getting infected than those in higher-income areas, the researchers write. And
regions with lower incomes also have fewer existing hospital beds for patients
in need of critical care. So even with COVID-19 mitigation strategies, the
study estimates that 25 times as many people may need beds as are available in
low-income countries, compared with seven times as many in high-income
settings. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Many nations have
implemented strategies similar to those in the study’s suppression scenario,
ramping up diagnostic testing and contact tracing in order to find and isolate
potentially exposed people. But others are falling behind, including the United
States. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Even very well-resourced
countries are having a really hard time with [testing],” says Stephen Kissler,
an epidemiologist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston who
wasn’t involved in the study. To help address the United States’ testing woes, the
Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-expedites-review-diagnostic-tests-combat-covid-19&quot;&gt;authorized a new diagnostic test&lt;/a&gt; on March 30 that could give results in five
minutes. Currently, patients have reported waits of days or even weeks for
their results. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But until there’s a vaccine
or effective treatment, it may be necessary to keep suppression measures in
place to prevent new cases from sparking another wave of infections. Kissler,
for instance, led a study posted March 24 at the preprint server medRxiv.org,
that found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041079v1&quot;&gt;one-time application of social distancing measures in the
United States&lt;/a&gt; for four weeks
up to 20 weeks may not be enough to slow the virus’ spread. So some form of social
distancing strategies might be intermittently necessary into 2022, coupled with
lots of diagnostic tests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is not seasonal flu,”
Kissler says. “This is sort of the perfect storm, where it has a low enough
mortality that it can spread, but a high enough mortality that it causes huge
societal disruption.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Lucy’s kind had small, chimplike brains that, nevertheless,
grew at a slow, humanlike pace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This discovery, reported April 1 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, shows for the first time that prolonged brain
growth in hominid youngsters wasn’t a by-product of having unusually large
brains. An influential idea over the last 20 years has held that extended brain
development after birth originated in the &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;
genus around 2.5 million years ago, so that mothers — whose pelvic bones and birth
canal had narrowed to enable efficient upright walking — could safely deliver babies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus
afarensis&lt;/em&gt;, an East African hominid species best known for Lucy’s partial
skeleton, also had slow-developing brains that reached only about one-third the
volume of present-day human brains, say paleoanthropologist Philipp Gunz of the
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and his
colleagues. And &lt;em&gt;A. afarensis&lt;/em&gt; is
roughly 3 million to 4 million years old, meaning slow brain growth after birth
developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-jaw-may-hold-clues-origins-human-genus&quot;&gt;before
members of the &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; genus appeared&lt;/a&gt;,
perhaps as early as 2.8 million years ago (&lt;em&gt;SN:
3/4/15&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Too few &lt;em&gt;A. afarensis&lt;/em&gt;
infants have been studied to calculate the age at which this species attained
adult-sized brains, Gunz cautions. The brains of human infants today reach
adult sizes by close to age 5, versus an age of around 2 or 3 for both chimps
and gorillas.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Gunz and colleagues estimated brain
volumes for six &lt;em&gt;A. afarensis&lt;/em&gt; adults
and two children, estimated to have been about 2 years and 5 months old. The
kids had brains that were smaller than adult &lt;em&gt;A. afarensis&lt;/em&gt; brain sizes in a proportion similar to human children’s
brains at the same age relative to adult humans. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new data suggest that, for Lucy’s species, “infant brain
size [relative to that of an average adult] may have been proportionally even
smaller than in human infants,” says biological anthropologist Zachary Cofran
of Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., who did not participate in the new
study. If so, that pattern would strongly point to an extended period of brain
growth for &lt;em&gt;A. afarensis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A. afarensis child’s skull&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3086558&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/033120_BB_lucy-brain_inline_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3086558&quot;&gt;A roughly 3.3-million-year-old &lt;em&gt;A. afarensis&lt;/em&gt; child’s skull, shown here, has revealed signs of prolonged growth of a brain that nonetheless had a chimplike structure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3086558&quot;&gt;@ Zeresenay Alemseged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gunz suggests the extended post-birth brain growth among &lt;em&gt;A. afarensis&lt;/em&gt; may have eased the physical
and nutritional burden on mothers caring for infants, especially if food was
scarce. It also “likely provided a foundation for the evolution of long
childhoods in the human lineage,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His group used high-resolution CT scans to study fossilized
braincases from an infant &lt;em&gt;A. afarensis&lt;/em&gt;
and six adults, including Lucy, all found at Ethiopia’s Hadar site. A second &lt;em&gt;A. afarensis&lt;/em&gt; infant braincase came from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/evolutions-child-fossil-puts-youthful-twist-lucys-kind&quot;&gt;Ethiopia’s
Dikika site&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/20/06&lt;/em&gt;). The
scans helped the researchers create 3-D digital reconstructions, or endocasts,
of impressions made by the brain on the skull’s inner surface. Endocasts
display signature folds and creases in brain tissue typical of humans or
chimps, although preservation of these neural landmarks varies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CT scans also let the researchers determine the infants’
ages by revealing microscopic layers of dental enamel that form daily during
childhood, which can be counted like tree rings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Dikika child’s well-preserved endocast retained a crease
and a set of grooves toward the back of the brain that are found in chimps, but
not in humans. These impressions mark a prominent neural area involved in
vision. Human brain surfaces lack these markings due to expanded neural tissue
that integrates visual and sensory information. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-hominid-little-foot-skeleton-reveals-brain-chimp&quot;&gt;A
South African &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; skull&lt;/a&gt;
was previously revealed to have signs of a chimplike visual area in the brain (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/10/19&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Neither of the &lt;em&gt;A.
afarensis&lt;/em&gt; infants showed evidence of humanlike frontal brain organization,
as has been reported for an approximately 300,000-year-old South African
hominid, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledis-brain-shows-humanlike-features&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo naledi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 4/25/17&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anthropologist and neuroscientist Todd Preuss of Emory
University in Atlanta agrees. Endocasts of the Hadar &lt;em&gt;A. afarensis &lt;/em&gt;skulls contain many preserved features from the
brain’s visual area that resemble those on an &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; child’s skull from South Africa that dates to
about 2.8 million years ago, says Preuss, who was not part of Gunz’s team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Much remains to be learned about the pace of brain growth in
&lt;em&gt;A. afarensis&lt;/em&gt;, says
paleoanthropologist Aida Gomez-Robles of University College London. Researchers
can’t track brain sizes of &lt;em&gt;A. afarensis&lt;/em&gt;
individuals from infancy into adulthood, so the new results don’t conclusively
determine growth rates, she notes. And earlier interpretations of hominid brain
organization based on endocasts have sparked frequent debate, leading
Gomez-Robles to withhold judgment on the brains of Lucy’s kind.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Physicists have finally captured a
superconductor’s wave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first direct evidence of a phase of matter known as a pair-density wave helps reveal the physics that underlies mysterious high-temperature superconductors, which conduct electricity without resistance at surprisingly high temperatures. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2143-x&quot;&gt;wave was detected using a scanning tunneling microscope&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report April 1 in &lt;em&gt;Nature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Physicists had suspected that
pair-density waves existed in these materials, and previous experiments had
hinted at their existence. But without direct proof, scientists couldn’t
advance their understanding of the materials. “Investigating and proving [that]
this phase not only might exist, but actually does exist, is very important,”
says theoretical physicist Eun-Ah Kim of Cornell University, who wasn’t
involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;High-temperature superconductors wowed
physicists when the materials came on the scene in the 1980s. Known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-high-temperature-superconductors-might-not-be-so-odd-after-all&quot;&gt;cuprates because they contain copper&lt;/a&gt;, the materials conduct electricity without resistance
at temperatures much higher than most other superconductors, some around 100
kelvins (about –173° Celsius) or higher (&lt;em&gt;SN:
12/8/17&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Although still chilly, such temperatures
are much easier to attain than the nearly absolute zero temperatures required
for many superconductors. The materials’ discovery led to high hopes that a
room-temperature superconductor could soon be found, possibly leading to new
technologies such as vastly more energy-efficient electric grids, magnetically
levitated trains and powerful supercomputers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, decades later, a room-temperature
superconductor has yet to appear on the scene. What’s more, scientists still
don’t fully understand the physics that makes these materials so special. In
particular, “we want to understand the microscopic mechanism of how superconductivity
occurs in those materials,” says physicist Kazuhiro Fujita of Brookhaven National
Laboratory in Upton, N.Y. Now, scientists are drawing a bit closer to a
solution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In superconductors, electrons buddy up into
duos called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electron-pairs-can-take-heat&quot;&gt;Cooper pairs&lt;/a&gt;,
a partnership that allows them to slip smoothly through the material without
resistance (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/13/15&lt;/em&gt;). In these
materials, scientists observe a gap in the energies of electrons, rather than a
continuous spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Physicists predicted that, in
high-temperature superconductors, the gap in the electrons’ energies would periodically
vary across the surface of the material in a strange kind of wave. That effect might
be linked to another unusual state that exists in the same materials at higher
temperatures, called the pseudogap phase. That state inhabits a strange
purgatory: It’s neither superconductor nor insulator, and it conducts
electricity but not all that well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fujita and colleagues detected the wave by
skimming across the surface of a superconducting compound — a bismuth-based copper
oxide — with a scanning tunneling microscope. The microscope has an extremely
thin tip that detects electrons that pass across the space between the superconductor
and tip via a quantum process known as tunneling. In this case, the researchers
also affixed a tiny piece of superconductor to the microscope’s tip, to search
for electrons tunneling from one bit of the superconductor to another. The
energy gap, the team reported, periodically varied across the surface of the
material in a wave, as predicted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is actually a direct measurement
of the pair-density wave component,” says theoretical physicist Eduardo Fradkin
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “It’s a really exciting
experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That pseudogap phase may be important in
the quest to increase the temperature range of high-temperature superconductors.
The new result could help scientists understand that phase better by illuminating
how these materials behave as they warm up.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A mysterious but well-preserved hominid skull found nearly a century ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2165-4&quot;&gt;comes from a population that lived in Africa around 300,000 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, as the earliest &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; were evolving, a new study finds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This discovery indicates that a separate &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; population, perhaps a species some researchers call &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-teeth-push-human-neandertal-split-back-about-1-million-years-ago&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;H. heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (SN: 6/22/19), inhabited Africa at the same time as both &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; and a recently discovered population dubbed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-may-have-lived-around-same-time-early-humans&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;H. naledi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (SN: 6/10/17), say geochronologist Rainer Grün and his colleagues. African &lt;em&gt;H. heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt; could have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-west-africans-may-have-dna-genes-ancient-ghost-hominid&quot;&gt;a recently reported “ghost population”&lt;/a&gt; (SN: 3/14/20) that interbred with ancient &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; and passed a small amount of DNA to present-day West Africans, the researchers suggest April 1 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We can now identify at least three distinct and contemporary [&lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;] lineages in Africa about 300,000 years ago, but we don’t yet know whether our ancestry was largely or entirely contained within the &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; part of that variation,” says paleoanthropologist and study coauthor Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have puzzled over the age of the Broken Hill skull since its 1921 discovery in south-central Africa. Metal ore mining at what was then Northern Rhodesia’s Broken Hill mine revealed deposits bearing the skull and two associated leg fossils. The site, located in what’s now known as Zambia, has been named Kabwe. Previous age estimates for the fossils, based on clues such rodent fossils and stone tools found at the site, have ranged widely from around 500,000 to 125,000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Because quarrying destroyed the site, sediment that may have
yielded fossils can’t be dated. Instead, Grün, of Griffith University in
Nathan, Australia, and his team dated small samples of bone and teeth from the
Broken Hill skull using measures of the radioactive decay of uranium and the
accumulation of natural radioactivity from sediment and cosmic rays. Based on
these techniques, the team estimates the skull’s age at between 324,000 and
276,000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Double-edged stone implements typically found at ancient &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; sites were also recovered
near the Broken Hill skull, suggesting that &lt;em&gt;H.
heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt; made the same type of tools, the scientists say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear if &lt;em&gt;H.
heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt; fashioned those artifacts, which also can’t be definitively
linked to the Broken Hill skull, counters archaeologist Eleanor Scerri of the
Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But a “seemingly reliable age of approximately 300,000
years” for &lt;em&gt;H. heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt; in Africa
fits a scenario in which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-denisovan-hominid-fossils-dna-top-science-stories-2019-yir&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; began evolving&lt;/a&gt; across
Africa (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/21/19&lt;/em&gt;) around that
time , Scerri says. In that scenario, mating occurred among dispersed human
populations with various skeletal traits, as did occasional interbreeding with
other &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; species. “It wouldn’t be
surprising if there was some gene flow between the lineage leading to us and &lt;em&gt;H. heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt;,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-known-homo-sapiens-fossils-come-northern-africa-studies-claim&quot;&gt;African
&lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; fossils&lt;/a&gt; from around 300,000
years ago (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/8/17&lt;/em&gt;), including the
Broken Hill skull, are either direct ancestors or close relatives of &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, says paleoanthropologist María
Martinón-Torres
of the National Research Center on Human Evolution in Burgos, Spain. But &lt;em&gt;H. heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt; has become a confusing
species designation, comprising a diverse group of partial hominid fossils that
can’t easily be compared to one another, she contends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Populations in many parts of Africa may have mixed and mingled to produce &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, “but at this point the picture is still blurred,” Martinón-Torres says.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how high your &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/09/more-time-spent-abroad-increases-self-concept-clarity-confidence-in-and-clarity-about-who-you-are/&quot;&gt;self-confidence&lt;/a&gt;, it’s likely that you have certain traits you’d change given the opportunity: maybe you’d turn down your anxiety, feel more outgoing in company, or be a bit less lazy. One 2016 &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167216637840&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that 78% of people wanted to better embody at least one of the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, emotional stability, conscientiousness, agreeableness, or openness to experience), so the desire to change who you are is not uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But are we so keen to change how moral we are? That is, how concerned are we really about being a good or bad person? A new study &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619893078?journalCode=pssa&quot;&gt;published in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619893078?journalCode=pssa&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that we’d rather spend time improving those parts of us that aren’t morally relevant, with traits like honesty, compassion and fairness taking a back seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39410&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Jessie Sun from the University of California, Davis, and Geoffrey Goodwin from the University of Pennsylvania asked two groups comprising a total of 800 participants to fill in an online survey, in which they self-reported their personality traits. The first set of questions was based on the Big Five personality domains, while the second looked at moral traits, with questions measuring general morality as well as honesty, fairness, loyalty and purity. Participants also indicated how much they wanted to change on each of these personality and moral traits, responding to statements like “I want to be helpful and unselfish with others”, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants also nominated four “informants” who knew them well. These informants rated their friend’s traits and reported what changes they’d like to see in the friend’s personality and moral character. Informants also selected the top three changes they’d like to see in their friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants most wanted to change their non-moral personality traits, particularly those relating to negative emotions: they wanted to reduce anxiety, depression, emotional volatility and anger. Creativity, productivity and sociability were the most desired traits, while moral traits such as honesty, loyalty and fairness took a back seat. And, overall, participants showed a weaker desire to change moral traits than non-morally relevant personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This preference was even more striking when the researchers considered the top three desired changes for each participant. In one of the groups, 48% of participants reported that becoming less anxious was one of their top three priorities, with 44% wanting to become less depressed. Desire for increased sociability and productivity, and reduced emotional volatility, also commonly made it to the top. But moral improvements were not prioritised: a desire to become more compassionate made the top three goals of just 9% of participants, and only 3% counted a goal to become more generally moral among their top priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern also emerged across the participants’ “informants”, who also expressed very little desire to change their friends’ moral traits and were likely to select goals that closely matched those picked by participants . The informants also wanted their friends to change less than the participants did themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern of results didn’t just come about because participants already saw themselves as particularly moral, the researchers argue. Instead, some of it may be down to self-interest: we’re more motivated to change in ways that improve our own sense of well-being, in other words. Being less depressed has an obvious and immediate impact on our lives; being “more moral” does not come with such straightforward benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although self-interest doesn’t sound like a particularly noble motivator, the fact that friends also seemed to prioritise the participants’ personal well-being is somewhat more cheering. The friends seemed to choose desired changes not by how “good” or “bad” they were likely to make the target, but by how likely they were to make their life better or happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/29/belief-in-our-moral-superiority-is-the-most-irrational-self-enhancing-bias-of-all/&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has also suggested a supreme confidence in our own moral superiority: we frequently believe we are more honest and trustworthy than others. In some cases, this may be true. But we could also benefit from thinking harder about our possession of these qualities when it’s time for self-improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619893078?journalCode=pssa&quot;&gt;Do People Want to Be More Moral?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 It’s a bit like a slugger crediting Barry Bonds for help with his homerun swing. An anesthesiology journal has retracted a 2018 paper that cited three retracted papers by Yoshitaka Fujii, the record-holder for most retractions by a single author.  As we’ve written before, journals had a spotty record in reacting to the Fujii scandal, … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2020/04/01/zombie-papers-why-do-papers-by-the-most-prolific-fraudster-in-history-keep-getting-cited/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Zombie papers: Why do papers by the most prolific fraudster in history keep getting cited?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;From its launch in 2003, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; quickly established itself as PLOS’ flagship journal in the life sciences–a model of Open Access and a catalyst for change in scholarly publishing as well as a leading publication for the life sciences. Today, we’re announcing the beginning of a new vision for the journal which builds upon its earlier successes and pushes boundaries even further to promote Open Science and excellence in publishing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We had considered holding back this announcement while so many of us are grappling with the impact of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. However, we view it as our duty as publishers, now and in the long term, to accelerate the path to publication and increase transparent research practices. We believe the changes to the scope and new article types on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;outlined below, will help researchers in the life sciences rapidly share their early findings and preregister their studies, and may prove to be particularly useful in these difficult times.. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To lead this new phase for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, we are also fortunate to welcome a talented and passionate new Editor-in-Chief, Nonia Pariente. Welcome, Nonia! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/Nonia_new-Bio-editor.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Nonia Pariente, PLOS Biology Editor-in-Chief&quot; class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-42876 size-thumbnail&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/Nonia_new-Bio-editor-150x150.png&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“I’m very excited to take on this new role. PLOS Biology has a very strong reputation and an inspiring vision. I am passionate about broadening its reach to all of the Life Sciences communities and strengthening its position in the publishing landscape. All important advances in every area of biology should feel they have a home in PLOS Biology”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px;&quot;&gt;— Nonia Pariente, PLOS Biology Editor-in-Chief&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pushing Boundaries in Service of Research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;When the journal launched, Open Access was an experimental publishing option. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; proved that being highly selective and Open Access were perfectly compatible, aligning all the benefits of immediate and global accessibility with impactful research. Our aim has always been to challenge the status quo in scientific communication in order to better meet researchers’ needs. With our past experience to guide us, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; is setting up a framework for assessment and publication that better aligns with the process of scientific inquiry itself, including:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Redefined selectivity criteria which will emphasize the importance of the research question and the quality of its execution; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A preregistration option offering peer review of the study design, with guaranteed publication of the final research article–regardless of the results–for accepted protocols;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Introduction of two linked article types, Discovery Reports and Update Articles, which enable researchers to report on ongoing work as their research develops and new information becomes available.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Combined with the existing criteria around openness of research data, a preprint deposition workflow, and the option for authors to publish their peer review history, these changes are part of PLOS’ larger goals to transform scientific communication in a way that empowers researchers to choose Open Science. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Surfacing the importance of the entire research process, not just results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As we’ve reflected on more than fifteen years of experience at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, and considered the publishing landscape, we acknowledge that publishing in highly selective journals remains an imperative for many researchers. The typical criteria used to select articles, however, continue to focus on novelty and perceived importance of the research results. As such, they continue to nurture a perverse system of incentives in which it matters to be first and to have an exciting headline–much less to be right and to have results that stand robustly to the test of time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;has already started addressing this challenge by giving a premium to transparency and access to underlying data, methodology and reagents, to enhance reproducibility. By introducing its ‘scooping policy’ through which novelty is not a disqualifying criteria within six months of an initial report. By opening up its peer review process to give context to decisions, as well as publishing valuable studies with clearly stated caveats when the consensus among reviewers is unclear. And even by asking authors to remove speculative results to reduce the hype that they sometimes feel pressured to provide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; will remain a selective journal–don’t take me wrong. But in its selection process, the journal now seeks to more systematically emphasize the importance of the research question and the quality of its approach and execution, before considering the importance of the results. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The new preregistration workflow, in addition to all the benefits it offers for reducing bias in experimentation and reporting, is also meant to encourage researchers to undertake important and well-designed studies with uncertain outcomes instead of censoring their research ideas based on the odds of publication. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The new linked article types will allow researchers to share their work more quickly, and to more effectively separate exploratory research during which they generate hypotheses (to be published as a Discovery Report) from its confirmatory phases, during which the hypothesis is further tested and new insights generated (to be linked as an Update Article). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome, Nonia Pariente!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Of course, none of this would be possible without a strong underlying editorial strategy. Joining our highly experienced team of staff editors, Nonia officially came on board earlier this month as Editor-in-Chief and is eager to get started on these new initiatives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“Since I started editing, and definitely as I have grown throughout my career as Chief Editor of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and now as Editor-in-Chief of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, my goal has been to help science advance and to help scientists communicate their stories… I think what makes PLOS Biology and PLOS in general stand out is that it is an organization that was founded with the goal and drive to innovate the process of scientific publication for the benefit of scientists and scientific advance. Thinking outside the box is almost an obligation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Please take a moment to get to know Nonia through her introduction on the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/biologue/2020/03/31/meet-plos-biologys-new-editor-in-chief-nonia-pariente/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Biologue blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, and read more about her vision for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; in her &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000707&quot;&gt;Editorial&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The scope and importance of this work is really too big for one post, so our team will be providing more details over the next few weeks with updates to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/biologue/&quot;&gt;this space&lt;/a&gt;. These new article types are immediately available to submitting authors and you can find more details on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/journal-information&quot;&gt;Journal Information&lt;/a&gt; page of our site.

 &lt;p&gt;Today &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; added to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://collections.plos.org/&quot;&gt;collection&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 papers since we started &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/&quot;&gt;fast-tracking submissions on January 31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230405&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was conducted by Constantinos Siettos from the Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Italy and colleagues. The authors used the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model with data between January 11 and February 10, 2020 and estimated key epidemiological parameters up until February 29. With these parameters, they forecasted that between 80,000 and 160,000 people would be infected by February 29 – in fact, around 84,000 are known to have become infected in this time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Siettos notes, “This is the first study based on a mathematical modelling approach that has provided relatively accurate three- week-ahead forecasts. Importantly, to the best of our knowledge this is the first study based on a mathematical modelling approach suggesting that the actual number of the infections in the total population is of the order of twenty times more than those reported, and that the mortality rate in the total population is about ~0.15% i.e. significantly less than reported 2-3%.Our findings imply that for the case of Hubei (with a 60m population), around 2%-3% of the total population in Hubei has been actually infected by coronavirus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science leaders have &lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/covid19-open-access-letter.pdf&quot;&gt;recently requested&lt;/a&gt; that the publishing community make their content open and re-usable. PLOS &lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/publishers-make-coronavirus-covid-19-content-freely-available-and-reusable&quot;&gt;already supports&lt;/a&gt;, and calls on others to support, COVID-19 research being shared such that it can be centrally text- and data-mined, and also versioned in places where it can be most conveniently discovered by those tackling this crisis in real time. We always push &lt;u&gt;all &lt;/u&gt;PLOS content to PubMed Central. We are also forwarding all of our submissions to the World Health Organization for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov&quot;&gt;database of publications on coronavirus disease (COVID-19)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are  compiling all our Coronavirus-related papers into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://collections.plos.org/&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/a&gt; as they publish. We encourage all researchers investigating pressing issues like disease outbreaks to also consider posting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/why-preprint&quot;&gt;Preprint&lt;/a&gt;.  You can find the most recent preprints relating to the coronavirus outbreak – posted across bioRxiv and medRxiv on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/search/title%3Acoronovirus%2Bwuhan%2B2019-nCoV%20title_flags%3Amatch-any%20jcode%3Amedrxiv%7C%7Cbiorxiv%20numresults%3A10%20sort%3Arelevance-rank%20format_result%3Astandard&quot;&gt;search link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A cat in Belgium seems to have become infected with the
coronavirus and may have had COVID-19, the disease that the virus causes. While
the case — the first reported in cats — suggests that the animals can catch the
virus, there is no evidence that felines play a role in spreading the coronavirus,
and it’s still unclear how susceptible they are to the disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is an isolated case, so it is not the rule,” microbiologist
Emmanuel André of KU Leuven said March 27 at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBCEc4s_9Vk&quot;&gt;news conference&lt;/a&gt; held by
Belgium’s public health institute. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cat probably picked up the virus, called SARS-CoV-2,
from its owner, who fell ill with COVID-19 after traveling to northern Italy. About
a week later, the cat started to show signs of illness: respiratory issues,
nausea and diarrhea. In lab tests, feces and vomit samples showed high levels of
SARS-CoV-2’s genetic material. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that positive result comes with caveats. The samples
were collected and sent to the lab by the owner, and a veterinarian has yet to
examine the cat. The cat recovered after nine days, and once it’s released from
quarantine, researchers will run a blood test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which
would provide more concrete proof of an infection. Those results are expected
in about a week. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Even if the cat tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, it
might be hard to definitively prove that the virus made the cat sick — lots of
other pathogens cause respiratory and stomach issues in cats. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“What makes us actually believe that this cat was infected
is that there was quite a lot of virus detected in the feces and vomit in
multiple tests over several days,” says Jane Sykes, a veterinarian at the
University of California, Davis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not that surprising that cats could pick up SARS-CoV-2. The virus zeroes in on a protein called angiotensin-converting enzyme II, or ACE2, to hack into cells. Cats and humans have versions of this protein that are nearly identical in spots where the virus binds. The virus that causes SARS &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sars-new-coronavirus-target-same-cellular-lock-infect-cells&quot;&gt;targets cells&lt;/a&gt; using the same break-in method (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/3/20&lt;/em&gt;), and it has been shown to infect &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/425915a&quot;&gt;cats and ferrets in a lab setting&lt;/a&gt;, though cats did not develop signs of disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a study in the March 2020 issue of &lt;em&gt;Journal of Virology&lt;/em&gt;, researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/7/e00127-20&quot;&gt;note that SARS-CoV-2 can
probably recognize ACE2&lt;/a&gt; in cats, ferrets, orangutans, monkeys and some bat
species. Another study,  published March
30 in &lt;em&gt;Cell Host and Microbe&lt;/em&gt;, confirms
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/pb-assets/journals/research/cell-host-microbe/PDFs/chom_2285_preproof.pdf&quot;&gt;SARS-CoV-2
can infect ferrets&lt;/a&gt;, too. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier in March, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-dog-pet-hong-kong-infection&quot;&gt;first
dog tested positive&lt;/a&gt; for SARS-CoV-2 (&lt;em&gt;SN:
3/5/20)&lt;/em&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202003/19/P2020031900606.htm&quot;&gt;another
pup&lt;/a&gt; on March 19. Neither dog had symptoms and both results were only weakly
positive, but the first dog, a 17-year-old Pomeranian from Hong Kong, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3075650/first-dog-found-coronavirus-has-died-after&quot;&gt;died
of unknown causes&lt;/a&gt; shortly after its release from quarantine. ACE2 looks a
little bit different in dogs, which might make it harder for the virus to
recognize and could make dogs less susceptible to infection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As in people, more testing could provide a crisper snapshot
of how the coronavirus affects pets. Hong Kong, for example, has continued to screen
some animals in homes with people who have tested positive for COVID-19. Out of
17 dogs and eight cats, only those two dogs &lt;a href=&quot;https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20200326.7146438&quot;&gt;have returned
positive results&lt;/a&gt;, as of March 25. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the United States, a company called Idexx Laboratories has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.idexx.com/en/veterinary/reference-laboratories/idexx-sars-cov-2-covid-19-realpcr-test/&quot;&gt;developed its own diagnostic test&lt;/a&gt; to detect genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 in animals. From February 14 to March 12, Idexx says that it tested over 4,000 dogs, cats and horses from the United States and South Korea. None has been positive for the virus. While the tests did include animals from hot spots like Seattle, it’s unknown if any of the animals lived in homes with people that had COVID-19. Idexx is continuing to test animals and has expanded its pool of subjects to Europe and Canada. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;While all that testing could fill in some unknowns about how the virus affects cats and dogs, pet owners shouldn’t panic. Cases in pets have been extremely rare so far. Sykes points out that if COVID-19 were a serious problem for pets, we would know it by now. “Dogs and cats may be what we call dead-end hosts,” she says. “They get infected with the virus. They shed it, but they’re unlikely to shed it enough to spread it to people.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The American Veterinary Medical Association recommends &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/covid-19&quot;&gt;taking normal precautions&lt;/a&gt; when cleaning litter boxes and feeding animals. If owners test positive for COVID-19, they should consider having someone else in the household care for the pet while they’re sick or wear a mask around the pet and limit contact. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html&quot;&gt;similar recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/sweets-140x110.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are your kids addicted to sugar? &lt;/em&gt;Children between the ages of 2 and 18 should eat less than six teaspoons of added sugar per day on average. This adds up to around &lt;strong&gt;25 grams&lt;/strong&gt; of sugar. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england&quot;&gt;Public Health England&lt;/a&gt; (PHE) children consume much more sugar than recommended; this equals around eight excess sugar cubes a day or &lt;strong&gt;2,800 excess&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;sugar&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;cubes&lt;/strong&gt; per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has instigated the ‘sugar smart’ campaign led by PHE which is aimed at raising awareness of the amount of sugars in foods and drinks and to encourage parents to reduce their children’s sugar consumption. ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/change4life&quot;&gt;Change4life&lt;/a&gt;‘ is England’s first national social marketing campaign, promoting the following the slogan “Eat Well, Move More, Live Longer”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Change4Life Sugar Smart campaign was launched on January 4th 2016. TV, billboard and digital advertising ran for six weeks to support the campaign. A Sugar Smart app was available for parents to download free of charge. The app enabled users to scan barcodes on food and drink packaging to find out how many grams of total sugars were contained in the product; depicted in sugar cubes, to help consumers visualize the amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-8422-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;A recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; aimed to determine whether the campaign was effective in altering dietary behavior, by assessing any impact of the campaign on sugar intake among children aged 5-11 years. This included looking into the parental perceptions of the campaign and exploring barriers related to reducing sugar intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents/guardians were asked to report their child’s dietary intake; telephone interviews were also conducted. This covered a range of topics including understanding of the general change4life message, the impact of sugar on health and family and social barriers experienced whilst trying to reduce children’s sugar intake. Findings indicate that parents often feel confused over the difference between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“[The children] thought because they couldn’t have sugar, they couldn’t have fruit and it was saying that sugar was bad, so we had to sort of explain that it’s not all bad; it’s just different types.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the campaign, many parents reported that they tried to switch out unhealthy food for a healthier version and reducing portion sizes, however, the largest barrier included time constraints due to a fast paced life style and the easy availability of sweet treats which led to increased leniency; for example, pudding at school or temptation in the local supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You get tired and sometimes you go, “oh, just eat it then”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall it was found that the health marketing campaign raised awareness of sugar in food and drinks in both parents and children, impacting food consumption in families. Sugar smart campaigns are likely to have a positive influence on reducing sugar consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Targeting the parents:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study concludes that a health marketing campaign aimed at both parents and children has a positive impact in reducing sugar intake, however, reductions in sugars are not always sustained long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents want to reduce their child’s sugar intake, but societal barriers as well as confusion over aspects of the diet to change often hamper efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the campaign was successful in raising awareness amongst both parents and children. The findings suggest that further education is required when it comes to different types of sugar and food labeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future campaigns should continue to target the parents, which in turn will have a knock on effect on reducing sugar consumption in the young. In the future campaigns should focus on combatting long term sugar reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/31/dreams-arent-just-visual-we-often-hear-voices-and-other-sounds-too/"/>
		<id>http://digest.bps.org.uk/?p=39407</id>
		<updated>2020-03-31T12:01:47+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At least since the philosophers of ancient Greece, scholars have pointed out the analogy between madness (psychosis) and dreaming…” So begins a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230212&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;PLoS One&lt;/em&gt;, that seems to shore up that analogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreams and psychotic hallucinations do have things in common. They both feature perceptual sensations that seem real, but which are conjured up by our brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are also differences. While dreams are known to be highly visual, psychotic hallucinations are primarily auditory. They generally involve hearing things that aren’t real rather than seeing things that don’t exist. And this difference is an important reason why “the idea of dreaming as a model for psychosis has remained speculative and controversial,” write Roar Fosse of the Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, Norway, and Frank Larøi of the Norwegian Centre of Excellence for Mental Disorders Research at the University of Oslo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to date, there’s been very little investigation into perceptions of sounds in dreams, the pair reports. And now they have data suggesting that, in fact, auditory perceptions are common. If this is the case, the links between psychotic experiences and dreams may be stronger than has been recently supposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39407&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Fosse and Larøi used social networks and a psychology group on Facebook to recruit 13 people who reported having good dream recall, but no psychiatric disorders or any other condition. Neither did they report taking any medication that might affect their sleep. The group consisted of 12 women and one man (with a mean age of 28).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were asked to keep a dream diary: to write down any dreams they could recall that had taken place just prior to awakening from sleep, and to keep doing this until they each had records for 10 dreams. They were told to record the detail of any dream, whether or not it featured sounds. But at the same time, they were asked to focus on any auditory content, and describe this in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that sounds featured often, being reported in 80% to 100% of each participant’s dreams. Most often, the sounds consisted of other people speaking. (There were even five instances described as speech in a foreign language that the dreamer did not understand.) But there were also 122 instances of the dreamer speaking and 59 instances of other types of sound, such as glass breaking, gun shots, people walking or running, and a radio playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Considering that dream reports include experiences from only the last minutes of sleep before awakening, and that dreaming normally takes place throughout REM sleep as well as in light NREM sleep, the available evidence suggests that normal, healthy people usually experience internally generated auditory sensations an array of times every night,” the researchers conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certainly some limitations to the study. This was a small group of almost all women who self-reported having good dream recall and who volunteered for the study — so may not represent the broader population. Also, rather than being regularly woken and asked what they were dreaming about, they only reported dreams when they woke spontaneously. Earlier work has found that such dreams tend to be more dramatic. So the content that they reported may not be typical of dreams experienced throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the findings are intriguing, and hint at all kinds of interesting work to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some parallels between the normal sleep wake cycle and theories about how psychotic hallucinations come about. As someone falls asleep and moves through early sleep stages into REM, there’s a general decrease in reflective, directed thought and a gradual increase in internally-generated perceptions. Theories of psychotic hallucinations, meanwhile, propose that an impairment in higher order, “top-down” regions (typically in the prefrontal cortex) allows for more internally-generated, sensory-like hallucinatory experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also some recent evidence suggesting similarities in the neurophysiological underpinnings of both dreams and psychotic hallucinations. Both states are associated with similar alterations in dopamine functioning and patterns of connectivity between certain regions of the cortex, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could possibly be an “intrinsic property of the brain-mind system” that reduced or compromised higher order cognitive, executive control facilitates both dream hallucinations and psychotic hallucinations, the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, though thinking about dreams and psychosis has a long history, it’s early days for this as a scientific field. More research will be needed to explore whether there really are meaningful, common underlying connections between the two states, or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230212&quot;&gt;Quantifying auditory impressions in dreams in order to assess the relevance of dreaming as a model for psychosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2020-03-31T12:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Black holes in the distant
universe blow winds with 100 times the energy of all the stars in the Milky Way
combined. These great gusts, called quasar outflows, carry enough material away from their home galaxies
to eventually shut down those galaxies’ star formation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0067-0049/page/Focus_on_HSTCOS_Observations&quot;&gt;astronomers report in six papers&lt;/a&gt; published March 16 in the &lt;em&gt;Astronomical Journal
Supplement Series.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We found the three largest,
most energetic outflows anyone has ever found,” says astronomer Nahum Arav of
Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. “At that size, they’re a serious influencer for
the evolution of the galaxy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Arav and his colleagues used
the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the masses, speeds and energies of
outflows from 10 quasars, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-find-far-flung-wind-black-hole-universe-first-light&quot;&gt;active supermassive black holes&lt;/a&gt; in the hearts of distant galaxies that can outshine
the galaxies themselves (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/5/18&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The observations, made over
about 60 hours in 2017, mark the first dedicated survey of quasar outflows.
Astronomers can’t see the gas directly. But as quasar light filters through the
gas, atoms and ions absorb specific wavelengths of light, revealing the outflows’
properties.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Illustrations
often show these outflows as twin jets streaming from the black hole perpendicular
to the galaxy’s disk of stars. But the gas probably flows out in all
directions, Arav says, and spreads like the surface of an expanding balloon. Astronomers
are unclear on exactly how the outflows are produced, but the gas may be
emitted in periodic outbursts over time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Theories of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmic-cloak-controls-galaxy-future-coming-focus&quot;&gt;how galaxies evolv&lt;/a&gt;e
suggested that outflows could propel gas and dust away from the galactic
center, enriching the material between galaxies with elements heavier than
hydrogen and helium (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/12/18&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-galaxy-grew-massive-then-oddly-stopped-making-stars&quot;&gt;shutting off star formation&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/11/20&lt;/em&gt;). Such galactic shutdowns could
explain why we see fewer big galaxies in the modern universe than supercomputer
simulations have suggested should be there. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Theorists could show very
easily, with back-of-the-envelope physics, that if the outflows have enough
energy,” they will shut down the galaxy’s star formation, Arav says. But
previous observations of distant galaxies, made with ground-based telescopes,
found outflow energies that were too low for that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hubble revealed light from
the quasars in the far ultraviolet wavelength range, which turns out to be
where most of the matter in the outflows can be seen. The team found that each
of the 10 quasars has three outflows, on average, which surround the black hole
like nesting dolls. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outflows are mostly
found between 300 and 3,000 light-years from the central black hole, which
means they extend far enough to have a big influence on the galaxy, Arav says.
And about half of the outflows measured were energetic enough affect their
galaxies’ fates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s good to see that [quasar
outflows are] important” for galactic evolution, says astronomer Jane Charlton
of Penn State, who was not involved in the new research. She had started to
wonder if quasars alone would be enough, or if some unknown galactic process
was needed. “This work is saying that it is probably enough.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ab596a&quot;&gt;most energetic outflow&lt;/a&gt; came from a quasar called SDSS J1042+1646 with 5×10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;
gigawatts, or 5 million trillion trillion gigawatts. For perspective, a nuclear
reactor puts out about one gigawatt of energy, while the total energy of all
Milky Way stars is about 10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; gigawatts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also found an
outflow with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ab4bcb&quot;&gt;largest acceleration ever seen&lt;/a&gt; from the same quasar. In 2011, the outflow was moving
at about 19,500 kilometers per second. But when the team looked again in 2017, the
gas was racing at 21,050 kilometers per second, 1,550 kilometers per second or about
8 percent faster, says astronomer Xinfeng Xu, also of Virginia Tech. At the faster
speed, the flow could travel from London to Washington, D.C., in about a
quarter of a second. Previously, astronomers had seen velocity shifts in only a
few outflows, and the differences were at most 900 kilometers per second over
three to five years. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These papers give us
fundamental information on what quasars are actually doing in blowing matter
out” — specifically the speeds, energies and accelerations of the gas, says
theoretical astrophysicist Jeremiah Ostriker of Columbia University. “It’s basic
information which we’re going to have to understand if we’re going to
understand the evolution of galaxies and the evolution of black holes.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;“Waiter, there’s a worm in my sushi.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diners may be more likely to utter those words today than in
decades past, as the abundance of parasitic &lt;em&gt;Anisakis&lt;/em&gt; worms infecting fishes
around the globe is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15048&quot;&gt;283 times
what it was in the 1970s&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report March 19 in &lt;em&gt;Global Change
Biology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Worms of the genus &lt;em&gt;Anisakis&lt;/em&gt;, also called whale worms,
can cause vomiting and diarrhea in people who ingest them. Fortunately, freezing
fillets kills the parasites, and farmed fish are rarely infected with them. Sushi
chefs and other fish suppliers can spot and remove the worms, which can reach
up to 2 centimeters in length. But the rise in worm numbers might spell bad
news for some marine animals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed hundreds of global scientific studies
published since 1967 to assess the number of worms — both &lt;em&gt;Anisakis&lt;/em&gt; and a
related genus called &lt;em&gt;Pseudoterranova &lt;/em&gt;— per individual fish. Overall, the
data included more than 55,000 specimens of 215 fish species. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 1978, the first year for which the researchers had
sufficient data for both worm groups, scientists reported finding less than one
whale worm on average per 100 fish. By 2015, they were finding more than one &lt;em&gt;Anisakis
&lt;/em&gt;worm on average per individual fish. The trend held true across fish
species and geographic regions, and regardless of the methods used to quantify
worms, which ranged from simple dissection to dissolving fish tissues with
acid. However, there was no global increase in reports of &lt;em&gt;Pseudoterranova&lt;/em&gt;,
also known as seal worms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;blue whiting fish with Anisakis worms&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3086494&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/032320_AD_sushi-parasites_inline_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3086494&quot;&gt;This blue whiting fish is crawling with &lt;em&gt;Anisakis &lt;/em&gt;worms. In the 1970s, the parasites were found in fewer than 1 in 100 fish. Now the average is more than one parasite per individual fish, so though some fish may have none, others may have many.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3086494&quot;&gt;Gonzalo Jara/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That increase in &lt;em&gt;Anisakis&lt;/em&gt; could be a problem for the
wrigglers’ diverse hosts: The worms’ eggs can be taken up by krill, which are
eaten by cephalopods like squid, which are ingested by fishes. All of these are
gobbled up by whales and dolphins. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Populations of any of those hosts could be at risk when &lt;em&gt;Anisakis&lt;/em&gt;
abundance is high, and the results aren’t pretty. For example, whale worms
infecting Atlantic salmon can cause red vent syndrome, with swelling and
bleeding of the opening to the digestive and reproductive tract. The worms are
often found in whale autopsies, though it’s unclear how ill infected animals might
become, says study coauthor Chelsea Wood, a parasite ecologist at the
University of Washington in Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The fact that &lt;em&gt;Anisakis&lt;/em&gt; worms appear to be increasingly
common could imply that host species are abundant enough to support a booming parasite
population, Wood says. If populations of a host species were dwindling, the
worms would struggle to complete their life cycle. Instead, “these worms might
be a signal that things are getting better for ocean ecosystems,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, the rise in &lt;em&gt;Anisakis&lt;/em&gt; may be due to the
fact that some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humpback-whales-south-atlantic-have-recovered-near-extinction&quot;&gt;whale
populations are rebounding&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN:
11/18/19&lt;/em&gt;). Those marine mammals play a crucial role in the worms’ life
cycle: &lt;em&gt;Anisakis&lt;/em&gt; reproduce only in
cetaceans. Wood’s earliest data points date to before the International Whaling
Commission’s moratorium on commercial whaling went into effect in 1986, though
a few nations persist in the hunt. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another possible, though hypothetical, explanation for the
parasites’ abundance is that the parasites’ life cycles might be speeding up as
ocean waters warm due to climate change. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wood’s team is now studying museum fish specimens that go
further back in time to determine whether today’s worm populations are a sign
of longer-term environmental decline, or rebound from human damage to the ocean
and its inhabitants. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“My gut feeling is that it’s about recovery to a prehuman
baseline,” Wood says. “In a pristine ocean, there were tons of marine mammals
pooping out lots of &lt;em&gt;Anisakis&lt;/em&gt; that infected fish in great abundance.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team is also investigating what such a high parasite
load might mean for those marine mammals, focusing on a struggling killer
whales population off the U.S. West Coast. “We don’t have a lot of information
about what the effects are,” Wood says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fish parasitologist Kurt Buchmann says Wood’s results match
his own observations. “It is my general impression that the occurrence of&lt;em&gt;
Anisakis&lt;/em&gt; has, in fact, increased, at least in some waters,” says Buchmann of
the University of Copenhagen. But while the new meta-analysis reports global
worm population averages, parasite patterns can vary locally, Buchmann notes. In
the Baltic Sea, for example, Buchmann has seen a dramatic rise in seal worms
along with their host, gray seals, even though the new study finds no change in
overall seal worm abundance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the study results, Wood hasn’t lost her taste for a
nice fish fillet. She’s confident that preparers will pick out the worms, and sushi
chefs outperform even scientists in spotting them, she says. “I still eat
sushi.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Graduate education, particularly the training of doctoral students, plays crucial role in the progress of society. Around 1,500 of the country’s 4,500 or so universities award doctoral degrees. In 2018 according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf20301/data-tables/&quot;&gt;Survey of Earned Doctorates &lt;/a&gt;55,185 students were doctorate recipients in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To match potential graduate students and graduate programs needs the interplay among students, college professors as evaluators, and admission committees.  Many academics are involved in the admission process of graduate students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a college professor, it’s my seasonal duty each fall to write letters of recommendation and rate students based on several criteria in order to help them gain acceptance to graduate schools. Students should ask several professors to evaluate them. Occasionally, I have to tell a student that I would not be able to write a strong recommendation, so it would be better not to ask me. We evaluators combine quasi-objective data (say, grades) and subjective impressions to generate a rating score. Despite the subjective nature, these evaluations are far from random, and college professors don’t have better ways of helping students and graduate programs find a good match.   At the individual level, rating and ranking of application to graduate schools dramatically influences the life of students. Admissions committees have a strong interest in ensuring they only accept mature, polite, reliable, and stable people into their program, and my professional duty is to help them achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One company provides software as a service to many universities for admissions and applications evaluations. Its software uses six criteria to rate students:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowledge in chosen field&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Motivation and perseverance toward goals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to work independently&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to express thoughts in speech and writing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability/potential for college teaching&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to plan and conduct research&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each criterion, the evaluator picks among five options: exceptional (upper 5%), outstanding (nxt 15%), very good (next 15%), good (next 15%), and okay (next 50%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we generate the numbers and check the appropriate rubric? In principle, a micro-rationalist, bottom-up approach would work. Teachers could collect and store data from students throughout decades, and they might have a formal algorithm for calculating the percentages. I believe it is more likely that many of us apply top-down strategies. We ask ourselves:  do I want to grant a set of grades that is all exceptional? Does the applicant have a clear weak point, in which I should check the third or maybe the fourth category? What if I score, say,  four outstanding and two exceptional?  The table below shows an example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;288&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EOQ4yPK5dd0-180x76.jpg&quot; width=&quot;682&quot; /&gt;Image credit: Peter Érdi&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought this student should be supported, because she seemed to be very motivated, independent and clever. However, I have never checked anybody to be “exceptional” in all categories. First, nobody is exceptional in everything, second, it would be suspicious if my scores were unfair and consciously biased, and so it might be counterproductive. In the case shown in the figure the candidate had little experience in her chosen field, so I checked the second column. Probably the third or even the fourth column would have been more appropriate. I did not feel I was cheating, but I knew I was a little biased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good or bad, decision makers calculate the sum of the scores, analyze their distribution, read the recommendations, and adopt some strategies to bring  decisions. (In some version of the ranking game, weights are assigned to the different features, to expressing the relative importance of the different features. University ranking systems  famously assign relative percentage weights to each ranking factors .) While rating with numbers contains subjective elements, we don’t have better ways to approximate objectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion of objective reality refers to anything that exists as it is independently of any conscious awareness or perceiver. Subjective reality is related to anything that depends upon some conscious awareness or some perceiver. Objectivity is associated with concepts like reality, truth, and reliability. Objectively ranking the tallest buildings in the world is relatively easy, since it is based on verifiable facts, and we have a result that everybody will accept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we accept that it is an impossible task to objectively ranking graduate students, what we could and should do? On the one hand, we could improve our ranking methodologies, on the other hand we (all stakeholders of the game from students to professors) should feel that our actions are as fair as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image by Joshua Golde from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/qIu77BsFdds&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-to-rate-and-rank-potential-doctoral-students/&quot;&gt;How to rate and rank potential doctoral students&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620581304/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620581304/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fEOQ4yPK5dd0-180x76.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620581304/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/a-guide-to-parent-self-care-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A guide to parent self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-we-can-equip-ourselves-against-climate-change/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How we can equip ourselves against climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/the-story-of-covid-19-by-the-numbers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The story of COVID-19, by the numbers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, arXiv now offers a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/covid19search&quot;&gt;quick search link to all coronavirus and COVID-19 research&lt;/a&gt; hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org&quot;&gt;arXiv.org&lt;/a&gt;. The search results are sorted by date, with the most recent papers at the top of the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also new on the arXiv homepage is an external link to&lt;a href=&quot;https://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/181&quot;&gt; medRxiv and bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt; preprints about the coronavirus and COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_589&quot; style=&quot;width: 430px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/03/arxiv-covid-19-quick-links.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;arXiv COVID-19 quick links as seen on home page&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-589&quot; height=&quot;116&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/03/arxiv-covid-19-quick-links-300x81.png&quot; width=&quot;430&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;COVID-19 quick links as seen on home page&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In times like this, we need global collaboration in research and shared knowledge among different disciplines,” says Eleonora Presani, arXiv Executive Director. “arXiv allows researchers from different backgrounds and geographical locations to quickly share their findings and push forward for the discoveries we need. It is an ideal platform for researchers to communicate with each other when speed is of extreme importance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a free, fast, and open access scholarly research distribution service, arXiv accelerates the pace at which science can advance. And online communication is particularly relevant now, with researchers around the world isolated due to travel restrictions and conference cancellations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the context of a pandemic like the one we’re experiencing, it is crucial to get information to people quickly, and arXiv provides a shared infrastructure and community to get scientific research to those that can make a difference,” says Greg Morrisett, Jack and Rilla Neafsey Dean and Vice Provost of&lt;a href=&quot;http://tech.cornell.edu&quot;&gt; Cornell Tech&lt;/a&gt;. “Already, there are preprints on topics ranging from genomic structure of the virus to epidemiological studies to projected economic impacts, and from every corner of the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new quick search link will expedite efficient research discovery, says Steinn Sigurdsson, arXiv Scientific Director. “Within arXiv, research on the coronavirus, associated clinical syndromes, and epidemiology is spread across multiple disciplines and tagged with a number of different keywords.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking up is never easy, particularly when you’re confronted with memories of happier times. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/18/trouble-sleeping-the-scent-of-your-lover-might-help/&quot;&gt;smell&lt;/a&gt;, an old photograph, a note somebody left you — weeks or even months after a break-up and you can still be reminded of your ex-partner, whether you like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On social media, this can be even worse. If you’re still friends with your ex, you’re likely to still see their posts on your feed; if you’re not, you can still rub salt into the wound by checking their profile anyway. ‘On this Day’ features are also notoriously bad for bringing up unhappy memories at the worst possible time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359172&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;published in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, &lt;/em&gt;we also see our exes so much because of the so-called “social periphery” — the networks of people we know tangentially through our ex-partners&lt;span&gt;. So why not design an algorithm that causes us less pain? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The new work suggests that this could be the answer to our online break-up woes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39396&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The study, conducted by Anthony Pinter and colleagues at the University of Colorado Boulder, focused on 19 adult Facebook users based in the US. Semi-structured interviews were held with each of the users on their feelings around break-ups and social media. Each had been in a relationship prior to the interview — either dating, cohabiting, or marriage — and were aged between 19 and 46.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants described a range of experiences in which they came into contact with their ex-partners online, from anything between six days to five years after the break-up. They were then asked to focus on specific features that could stop them from coming across their ex — unfriending or unfollowing, for example, or changing the way they view their newsfeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, emotions ran high. Participants reported feeling pained by seeing content involving their ex-partners, whether that was new information (such as an ex’s new relationship status) or past memories (such as anniversary posts or photographs). “The most upsetting thing on Facebook is On This Day,” one participant said. “It said I was the best husband ever and she loved me the most… I remember that, and obviously not physically being hurt, but just feeling an emotional wallop of like ‘Fuck, that wasn’t that long ago’”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all fairly unexpected: unwanted contact with an ex-partner is obviously going to be difficult in some regard. But while the problem may be well-established and familiar, there could still be a novel response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, the authors argue, is that machine learning has focused on methods that “fail to capture social nuances, relationships and other human-centred concerns” — in other words, that the algorithms present to us an unnatural or unhelpful model of our social relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are workarounds when it comes to existing platforms — unfriending, unfollowing or blocking ex-partners, or opting out of features like ‘On This Day’. But because of the social periphery, distant connections still linger after a break-up: one participant talked of their ex-partner’s mother’s frequent appearance on their feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being clear about what will happen when you mute or block someone is a good first step. But such fixes, the authors believe, are far from perfect. It’s the algorithms themselves that need changing, taking into consideration our complex social peripheries as well as our one-to-one connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, algorithms mainly take notice of binary connections — how much or little we choose to see from one particular person. By tweaking these algorithms to take into consideration not only peripheral &lt;em&gt;relationships&lt;/em&gt; but also events, interests, photos and groups could mean our social periphery is both better represented online and easier to evade post-break up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complexities of such encounters should also be taken into consideration. It’s unlikely to matter if an ex has clicked ‘attending’ on a large event that spans multiple days or takes place in multiple locations, so seeing that they’ve done so may cause unnecessary pain. Knowing they’re likely to attend a small gathering of friends, however, may be more useful information if you’re keen to avoid an awkward meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When, or if, algorithms become more human-focused, we may find ourselves having less stressful interactions with our ex-partners online. Blocking and unfriending might not be perfect, but at the moment may be the next best thing.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Hilde Fålun Strøm and Sunniva Sorby are taking citizen science to
the extreme. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In August, the two women moved into a tiny hunting cabin on the
high-Arctic Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. The hut, dubbed Bamsebu, is the
only shelter for 140 kilometers. Polar bears prowl the area. It’s not unusual
for the winter chill to reach around –30° Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The conditions are so harsh that few polar scientists themselves
collect field data from the area during winter. That’s where Fålun Strøm and
Sorby come in — gathering observations about wildlife and the environment that
could help scientists’ understand how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-report-card-how-poor-environmental-health-affects-everyday-life&quot;&gt;rapid
warming is changing Arctic ecosystems&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/11/19&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both Fålun Strøm and Sorby were inspired to support climate
research with this nine-month Arctic sojourn after seeing how climate change was
affecting polar regions. For example, Fålun Strøm, who has lived for 23 years in
Svalbard, has watched the land &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heartsintheice.com/futuretalks/&quot;&gt;get greener while glaciers have
retreated&lt;/a&gt; and average temperatures risen. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Both women, who call themselves &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heartsintheice.com/the-bamsebu-team/&quot;&gt;the Bamsebu team&lt;/a&gt;, have
experience treading frozen grounds. Sorby, who has worked more than two decades
as a historian and guide in Antarctica, has skied the Greenland ice cap and
across Antarctica to the South Pole. Meanwhile, Fålun Strøm, who has spent more
than a year total in trappers’ huts across the Arctic, is versed in dogsledding
and big-game hunting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s as if all of my years in
Svalbard have prepared me for this overwintering,” Fålun Strøm says. But even for
her, the Bamsebu experience is rough. There is no running water, so the women thaw
chunks of ice hacked from a block outside their hut. They chop wood to keep the
oven ablaze for cooking and heating the cabin. Venturing outside requires layers
of clothing and a gun to guard against polar bears. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;reindeer&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3086414&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/032020_mt_scilife-arctic-citizen_inline1_reindeer.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3086414&quot;&gt;On the Norwegian archipelago Svalbard, two citizen scientists are keeping detailed logs of the animals they see, such as reindeer, foxes, polar bears and belugas. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3086414&quot;&gt;Hearts in the Ice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We photograph incessantly,” snapping
foxes, reindeer, polar bears and beluga whales as part of the women’s wildlife
observations for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npolar.no/en/&quot;&gt;Norwegian
Polar Institute&lt;/a&gt;, Sorby says. Those observations may give insight into how animals
in the region are adapting to warmer weather.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In November, the women encountered a
polar bear that had recently hunted a reindeer. That was odd, because polar
bears normally eat seals. Scientists suspect bears may be forced to change
eating habits because warmer ocean currents are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-how-climate-change-already-altering-oceans-ice-future&quot;&gt;drastically
shrinking sea ice&lt;/a&gt; where bears hunt seals (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/25/19&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For NASA, the women are photographing
different types of clouds, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/night-shining-noctilucent-clouds-have-crept-south-summer&quot;&gt;shimmery
noctilucent clouds&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/16/19&lt;/em&gt;), as well as helping observe
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/auroras-dunes-pulsating-cusp-steve&quot;&gt;daytime
auroras&lt;/a&gt; visible only in 24-hour darkness (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/7/20&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Hearts in the Ice Arctic map&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3086416&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/032020_mt_scilife-arctic-citizen_inline3_map.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3086416&quot;&gt;The trapper’s hut where Fålun Strøm and Sorby are overwintering is in the high Arctic, at 78° N, on the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard (circled). Their nearest neighbor is the town of Longyearbyen about 140 kilometers away. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3086416&quot;&gt;TUBS/Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 3.0)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the women are collecting
phytoplankton samples for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/fjordphyto/&quot;&gt;FjordPhyto citizen science project&lt;/a&gt;, which usually
relies on tourist ships to collect samples from fjords in Antarctica. The project’s
goal is to uncover how phytoplankton near the poles are reacting to glaciers
melting, and sending more freshwater into marine environments. Some studies in
the Antarctic show a shift from bigger phytoplankton to smaller phytoplankton, which
leaves less algae for animals like fish and krill to eat, says FjordPhyto
leader Allison Cusick, a biological oceanographer at the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. The samples from the Bamsebu team could
indicate whether a similar shift is happening in the north. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This type of endeavor … is a
fantastic example of citizen science that’s generating data that we just simply
haven’t seen before,” says remote-sensing researcher Eric Saczuk at the British
Columbia Institute of Technology in Burnaby, Canada. Saczuk equipped the two
women with a drone to take aerial observations around Bamsebu — something
that’s rarely been tried before in polar science, he says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The long winter night, stretching from
sunset in October to sunrise in February, presented a new challenge for Sorby,
who had never before lived through months of darkness. Outdoors, the pair could
only see as far as the beams of their head lamps. But that darkness also opened
up another world to Sorby. “When the night sky is full of stars, planets,
satellites and the aurora … I feel showered with lights.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Hearts in the Ice Arctic hut&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3086412&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/032420_mt_scilife_inline_green.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3086412&quot;&gt;During the months-long Arctic winter night, the only lights in the sky are stars, planets, satellites and auroras. When Fålun Strøm and Sorby could finally again see outside without head lamps or night vision binoculars, “it was as if we were reborn,” the team wrote in a blog post on January 23. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3086412&quot;&gt;Hearts in the Ice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The original plan was for the Bamsebu team
to return home in early May, greeted by family, friends and their international
science partners — although the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-questions-covid19-symptoms-deaths-spread&quot;&gt;ongoing
coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt; has put those plans on hold (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/4/20&lt;/em&gt;).
“We are not sure how long we will be here,” Sorby says. “It will be surreal to
think of leaving this simple, purposeful life and coming back to a world that
has been turned upside down.” &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Back in
the days before the internet — with no e-mail, no texting, no Twitter — people
wrote letters. Even famous people, like Einstein.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And famous people’s letters were most likely to have been saved — and in Einstein’s case, published. For more than 30 years now, the Princeton University Press has been publishing Einstein’s letters (and his papers, and talks, and whatever else he wrote). His letters reveal nuances about his genius — and some downsides to his personality — that seldom show in his formal papers and lectures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This month Princeton released &lt;a href=&quot;https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol15-trans/&quot;&gt;the latest volume&lt;/a&gt; of Einstein’s papers, covering the period May 1925–June 1927, while Einstein was at the University of Berlin. It was an especially exciting time in science, as it corresponded with the infancy of quantum mechanics, midwifed by Werner Heisenberg in 1925 while at the University of Göttingen in Germany. Einstein also faced new challenges to his theory of relativity during this time, and his letters convey his despair at lack of progress toward his goal of a unified theory of gravity and electricity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During that quest, quantum mechanics arrived as an unwelcome distraction. Heisenberg ignited a flurry of quantum activity when he devised novel mathematics for describing the mechanics of electrons and other subatomic particles — work that extended the earlier quantum ideas of Max Planck, Niels Bohr and Einstein himself. Shortly thereafter, the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger formulated a competing version to Heisenberg’s (which although appearing very different conceptually, turned out to be equivalent mathematically). Einstein liked the Schrödinger approach, but did not think very highly of Heisenberg’s.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Heisenberg
has laid a big quantum egg,” Einstein wrote to physicist Paul Ehrenfest in
November 1925. “In Göttingen they believe it (I don’t).”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Schrödinger
had applied the math of waves to electrons. But Heisenberg treated the electron
as a particle, describing its energy states with mathematical expressions known
as matrices. Matrix algebra had been studied by mathematicians for decades — news
to Heisenberg, who figured it out for himself. He then collaborated with physicists
Max Born and Pascual Jordan (who did know about matrices) to develop &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.isy.liu.se/jalar/kurser/QF/references/onBornJordan1925.pdf&quot;&gt;the new quantum mechanics&lt;/a&gt; for describing the subatomic
world. Making sense of that world required physicists to relinquish ordinary
notions of space and time, Heisenberg insisted. “Atoms would certainly not
exist,” he wrote to Einstein, “if our space-time concepts were even only approximately
correct for very small spaces.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Einstein
expressed interest in the Heisenberg-Born-Jordan approach and a related
formulation by British physicist Paul Dirac. But he resisted accepting the
matrix math as the correct language for describing nature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Heisenberg-Dirac theories certainly drive me to admiration, but to me they don’t smell of reality,” he wrote to physicist Arnold Sommerfeld in August 1926. To Schrödinger, Einstein wrote that he much preferred the wave picture of the electron that Schrödinger had developed. “I am convinced that with your formulation of the quantum conditions you have found a decisive advance,” he wrote. “I am also convinced just as much that the Heisenberg-Born path is misguided.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In December 1926, Einstein wrote to Born (a close friend)
that he respected the matrix approach, but could not accept one of its revolutionary
implications: that nature’s behavior was governed by statistical laws. “The
theory delivers much but it hardly brings us closer to the Old One’s secret,”
Einstein wrote (“Old One” referring to God). “In any event, I am convinced that
&lt;em&gt;He&lt;/em&gt; is not playing dice.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During this time, Einstein struggled with the challenge of unifying
his theory of gravity — general relativity — with the electromagnetic forces
involved with electrons and light. He believed in the “essential unity of the
gravitational field and the electromagnetic field,” while realizing the
theoretical account of that unity had not been properly framed. In a paper
published in September 1925, he announced that he had succeeded in finding “the
true solution.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Einstein soon recanted. In elaborating his equations of
general relativity to include electromagnetism, he still believed he was on the
right path, but was short of the destination. “These equations do not determine
the mass and charge of electrons and protons; hence they still need amendment
in order to express the entire laws of nature,” he wrote to astrophysicist Arthur
Eddington in January 1926. Einstein acknowledged questions about whether the
solutions to his equations would correspond to reality. “As long as these
questions cannot be answered,” he wrote Eddington, “one cannot know whether the
general theory of relativity … fails in the face of quantum phenomena.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, his special theory of relativity, published in
1905, had been called into question by new experiments in California. Einstein’s
special theory held that light traveled at the same velocity regardless of the
motion of its source (or any observer measuring it). If so, the “ether” in
which light waves supposedly vibrated must not exist. Otherwise the velocity of
light measured on Earth would depend on the Earth’s direction of motion through
the ether. Albert Michelson and Edward Morley’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.aip.org/history/exhibits/gap/Michelson/Michelson.html&quot;&gt;famous experiment&lt;/a&gt;
in Cleveland in 1887 had found no evidence of any such ether, crucial support
for Einstein’s theory. But in 1925, physicist Dayton Miller reported new experiments
contending that the ether affecting light’s velocity really did exist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Miller had repeated Michelson and Morley’s experiment in
Cleveland, finding only a slight possible hint of an ether effect there. But
then at a higher altitude — Mount Wilson in California — Miller claimed to find
substantial signs of the ether.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Miller’s results induced Edwin Slosson, director of the young
publication &lt;em&gt;Science News-Letter &lt;/em&gt;(which
later became &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;), to write Einstein in June 1925
requesting comment. Einstein replied that if subsequent work confirmed Miller’s
results, “then the special relativity theory, and with the general theory in
its present form, falls. Experiment is the supreme judge.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Einstein did not believe that Miller’s result would
stand. In December 1925, he wrote to his friend Michele Besso that failure to
control temperatures properly probably led to Miller’s erroneous results. “I
didn’t take them seriously for a single moment,” Einstein declared.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In January 1926, Einstein cabled a journalist saying that
there was virtually no chance that Miller’s experiments were correct; they
indicated some unknown source of error rather than a true effect. “If you, dear
reader, wanted to use this interesting scientific situation to make a bet, I
recommend you bet that Miller’s experiments will prove faulty” or having
nothing to do with an ether, Einstein advised. “I myself would be quite happy
to put my money on that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon other experiments failed to confirm Miller’s (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0608238&quot;&gt;his analysis of the data contained errors&lt;/a&gt;),
and the special theory of relativity emerged victorious, as it remains today.
As does Einstein’s legend.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That legend is not without tarnish though, as his letters
occasionally reveal indications of misogyny. Most disconcerting to Einstein
fans would be a letter from October 1925, in which Einstein berates his
ex-wife, Mileva, for threatening to embarrass him with her memoirs. “Does it
not enter your mind at all that no one would care one bit about such
scribblings if the man that they were about had not, coincidentally,
accomplished something special? If someone is a nobody, there is nothing to
object to, but one should be truly modest and keep one’s trap shut. This is my
advice to you.” Einstein then contends his remarks showed how good he was being
to her — otherwise he would not be dispensing such sound advice. “Not only
children need a smack now and again, but so do adults, and most especially
women.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like most humans, Einstein was a mixed bag. His bag was filled with greatness but not free from flaws. As we all now know because, like few other people in history, his letters have been so carefully preserved for posterity to analyze, and admire, and sometimes criticize.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;As
increasingly stringent measures to keep people apart are put in place to slow
the spread of the coronavirus, mental health experts are warning that losing
everyday social connections comes with psychological costs. And those costs
could go up the longer such measures drag on. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In
response to the accelerating pandemic, a growing number of states have banned all
nonessential activities and asked residents to stay home. Across the country, colleges
and offices have gone entirely online, schools and restaurants are closed and
nursing homes are barring visitors. Such social distancing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-pandemic-limit-spread-social-distancing-travel-bans&quot;&gt;can stop, or at least slow, the spread of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, the disease caused by the new coronavirus (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/13/20&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But
“for some people, a lack of social connectedness feels as impactful as not
eating,” says Joshua Morganstein, a psychiatrist and disaster mental health
expert at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Md. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research
on the psychological toll of social distancing during epidemics is limited. But
a review in the March 14 &lt;em&gt;Lancet &lt;/em&gt;provides some clues. Researchers
evaluated 24 studies looking at the psychological outcomes of people who were
quarantined, an extreme form of social distancing, during outbreaks of SARS,
H1N1 flu, Ebola and other infectious diseases since the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Many
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30460-8/fulltext&quot;&gt;quarantined individuals experienced both short- and
long-term mental health problems&lt;/a&gt;,
including stress, insomnia, emotional exhaustion and substance abuse. For
instance, one study compared quarantined versus non-quarantined individuals
during an equine influenza outbreak. Of 2,760 quarantined people, 34 percent, or
938 individuals, reported high levels of psychological distress, which can
indicate mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, during the
outbreak compared with 12 percent of non-quarantined individuals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another
study looked at the effects of the 2003 SARS outbreak on 549 hospital workers
in Beijing. Those who were quarantined or worked in high-risk settings — almost
half the sample — reported higher levels of alcohol abuse three years later
than workers with less-intense exposure to the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Certain
factors increased the risk of psychological problems, such as quarantines
lasting longer than 10 days (which was associated mostly with post-traumatic
stress), poor information about the rationale for the quarantine, and lack of
access to necessary supplies and telecommunication services. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mitigating
those risks can reduce the likelihood of mental health problems, says review
coauthor Neil Greenberg, a psychiatrist at King’s College London. “Although
isolation can be unpleasant,” he says, “it need not cause serious mental health
difficulties.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though
most people living in coronavirus-stricken countries aren’t quarantined, research
elsewhere suggests even less-extreme forms of social distancing, such as
staying several feet away from other people or avoiding regular outings, might take
a toll. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The
potential for social distancing to become a long-term event is what worries psychiatrist
Damir Huremovic of Northwell Health in Manhasset, N.Y. Health
problems associated with social isolation tend to crop up when the situation goes
on beyond a few weeks, he says. Walling people off from one another for months means
the secondary effects of the pandemic, such as recession, social unrest and
unemployment, could trigger unpredictable and widespread mental health
challenges. “I sincerely hope we do not get to
this stage,” says Huremovic, who cowrote
and edited the 2019 book &lt;em&gt;Psychiatry of
Pandemics: A Mental Health Response to Infection Outbreak&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Especially
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-questions-covid19-symptoms-deaths-spread#mostrisk&quot;&gt;at
risk are the elderly&lt;/a&gt;, who both get more ill from the coronavirus
and already experience high rates of social isolation (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/4/20&lt;/em&gt;). As people age, they often lose the ability to get around and socialize, and their support
systems shrink as friends and family die. In February, a study from the
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reported that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nap.edu/resource/25663/Social%20Isolation%20and%20Loneliness%20Report%20Highlights.pdf&quot;&gt;nearly a quarter of Americans age 65 and older are socially
isolated&lt;/a&gt;, defined as having few
social relationships or infrequent contact with others. And 43 percent of
adults age 60 and older feel lonely. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We already have a lot of social distance between us,” says study
coauthor Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a health psychologist at Brigham Young
University in Provo, Utah.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chronic-stress-can-wreak-havoc-body&quot;&gt;Such loneliness and isolation may harm overall health&lt;/a&gt; across age groups (&lt;em&gt;SN: 2/20/15&lt;/em&gt;). In 2015, Holt-Lunstad
and her colleagues did a meta-analysis of
70 studies involving more than 3.4 million participants followed for an average
of seven years. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25910392&quot;&gt;The likelihood of dying during the study period&lt;/a&gt; increased by 26 percent for those who reported
loneliness (feeling alone), 29 percent for those who were socially isolated
(having few social contacts) and 32 percent for those living alone, the team
found. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some people will fare better than others
during this period of social distancing. Some may actually see their social
contact increase as families hunker down together. And some people will stay connected
through phone calls, text message or joining an online community. “We live in
this age of unprecedented communication [capabilities],” Huremovic says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those
communication capabilities could even help provide medical and psychological
care from afar. Limited research suggests that telehealth services work to
alleviate loneliness or help those living alone or far from health centers. But
gerontologist Verena Menec doubts they can substitute for face-to-face contact
indefinitely. “In the long run, if you only had that kind of contact, I don’t think
that would be enough,” says Menec, of
the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And
modern technology is no substitute for human touch, such as holding hands,
hugging or massage, which studies suggest can affect health, including possibly
&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Abstract/2008/11000/Influence_of_a__Warm_Touch__Support_Enhancement.4.aspx&quot;&gt;lowering blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4323947/&quot;&gt;reducing the severity of symptoms from the common cold&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientist
James Coan especially worries about those individuals requiring medical care
during this pandemic, either for COVID-19 or some other condition. Many
hospitals are barring visits from loved ones which makes sense to prevent the
virus’ spread. But that also reduces touch when people need it most, says Coan
of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. His work suggests, for
instance, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31241496&quot;&gt;handholding can reduce physical pain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even touch that comes from a hospital worker in protective gear instead of a loved one is better than nothing, Coan says. “I’ve been banging on this drum for a long time. [We] have got to figure out a way to make touch part of the medical program.” &lt;/p&gt;</content>

Large droplets were thought to contaminate the area immediately surrounding an infected individual, because they settle before evaporating. In contrast, small  droplets evaporate quickly and form residual particulates, or aerosols. However, the classification of droplet size (and therefore the mode of transmission) is not based on modern science. Yet this scheme still informs public health policy to this day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The figure above shows a Multiphase Turbulent Gas Cloud From a Human Sneeze (&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852&quot;&gt;Bourouiba, 2020&lt;/a&gt;). The puff trapped droplets of many sizes and carried them quite a long distance (23-26 feet!) while evading evaporation. Droplets that settle can contaminate surfaces. Aerosols may persist in the air for hours, depending on ambient temperature and humidity, as well as prevailing winds or &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;airflow of indoor ventilation systems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://edhub.ama-assn.org/jn-learning/video-player/18357411&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Watch the educational video&lt;/a&gt; showing Respiratory Pathogen Emission Dynamics and you will be truly horrified!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;This newer understanding of respiratory emission dynamics has implications for mask and respiratory design, social distancing recommendations, and other public health interventions during and after the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of masks, droplets are visible after sneezing into a surgical mask (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/335/7633/1293&quot;&gt;Granville-Chapman &amp;amp; Dunn, 2007&lt;/a&gt;).

The air samples themselves were negative, however. And standard cleaning  procedures effectively decontaminated surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;ADDENDUM (March 28, 2020)&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SamWangPhD/status/1243779902568103936&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@SamWangPhD&lt;/a&gt; rightfully pointed out that sneezing is not a symptom of coronavirus-19 infection. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/neurocritic/status/1243779092027068417&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;My initial reply&lt;/a&gt; was that an asymptomatic individual could be strolling through a park and sneeze due to allergies. On a more scientific note, it's true that the COVID-19 symptom of coughing isn't as violent as sneezing. However:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;droplets of diameter 30 µm can have a horizontal range of up 2.5 m away from the cougher due to cloud dynamics.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RtS0PQhiofM/Xn-XgrDNUBI/AAAAAAAANE0/NyJhDDiCaqMUO8ZnrKen-e1br0Yk_zPQgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/height%2Band%2Bdistance%2Bfrom%2Bcougher_Fig%2B18b.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;398&quot; data-original-width=&quot;474&quot; height=&quot;268&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RtS0PQhiofM/Xn-XgrDNUBI/AAAAAAAANE0/NyJhDDiCaqMUO8ZnrKen-e1br0Yk_zPQgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/height%2Band%2Bdistance%2Bfrom%2Bcougher_Fig%2B18b.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig. 18b (&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/violent-expiratory-events-on-coughing-and-sneezing/475FCFCBD32C7DB6C1E49476DB7A7446&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Violent expiratory events: on coughing and sneezing&quot;&gt;Bourouiba et al., 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bourouiba L (2020). &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Turbulent Gas Clouds and Respiratory Pathogen Emissions: Potential Implications for Reducing Transmission of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;JAMA&lt;/i&gt; March 26.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granville-Chapman J, Dunn RL.

 &lt;p&gt;As school closures and quarantines take place across the globe, the overwhelming anxiety is palpable in the newfound realities of a pandemic. Trips to the grocery store are now strategized, as shoppers face empty shelves and shortages of household staples. This will undoubtably continue as anxiety thrives on uncertainty increasing stress and driving us to seek answers and information in an evolving landscape. Keeping ourselves healthy and safe is a tall order and is further compounded by the challenge of maintaining our values and goals as parents. Still, it is vital that we support ourselves as individuals first, because maintaining our mental and physical health is the foundation from which we support our children during these trying times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First and foremost – plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than ever, it is important to follow the warnings and guidelines of trusted resources. This includes the WHO, state and local governments, and public health agencies. For personal advice, turn to your doctor and your child’s pediatrician. Websites, including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.healthychildren.org/&quot;&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, are another source of trusted information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disconnect to reconnect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After keeping up to date with developments in the pandemic, schedule time to disconnect from the consumption of social media and news outlets. Being bombarded with information fuels panic and inhibits preparedness. Further, media consumption turns you away from face-to-face interactions with your partner/spouse and children leading to missed opportunities for connection and comfort. By imposing limits, we can model how to manage our handling of difficult information, and also limit our child’s exposure to anxiety ridden media and social media content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, take this hibernation as an opportunity to recharge and strengthen bonds as a family. The forced decluttering of our schedules allows us to foster one-on-one interactions, a sense of togetherness, and protects us from anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain your foundation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undoubtably routines, habits, and daily activities are disrupted by cancellations in schools, activities, and events. These disruptions are unavoidable, unnerving, and trigger negative emotions that may stray us away from essential self-care routines needed to support our health and mental health. Self-care takes many forms including daily mediation practice, home-based hobbies (such as cooking/baking, gardening, redecorating, channeling your inner Marie Kondo), exercise, crafting or sewing, writing, art, collecting, reading, etc. By taking care of yourself first you are fueling your ability to care for others and minimizing your vulnerability to illness, irritability, and anxiety – all of which draw you away from mindful parenting. For example, I have committed to starting each day with a yoga practice and ending many days with a meditation practice. These few quiet moments ensure that no matter how much arguing my kids do (with myself or each other), I reduce my vulnerability to stray from my parenting goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reconnect with natural joys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exercise and nature are pillars for maintaining our health and mental health, making them an essential part of our daily routine. Vitamin D, daily exposure to the elements, and physical activity help maintain our health, ensure better sleep, and protect us from negative moods. This is also a great way to pass time with kids or grab a few moments of needed solitude. This can be as simple as doing daily activities outside such as meals, reading, work, and schoolwork or more adventurous such as exploring your neighborhood or local hiking paths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice gratitude and altruism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reflecting on the gifts of today is an essential element of happiness and contentment. And while it is easy to ruminate on our loss of freedom and normalcy, focusing on the negative only perpetuates despair. Although it may not be automatic, taking a few minutes each day to mindfully list things you are thankful for will change your perspective and increase your sense of well-being. The practice of gratitude is also great for the whole family, allowing children to focusing on the positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for helping others in a time of need. Can you run errands for your elderly neighbor? Or help organize activities for kids and share them with other parents? Take this opportunity to sort out old toys, books, and clothes and make donations to charity? By helping others, we strengthen our sense of belonging and gain a sense of community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know when to seek help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, as you and your family will undoubtably experience anxiety during the coming days and weeks it is important to know when and where to seek help. Panic will only fuel impulsive behavior, reduce intelligent decision making, and increase our vulnerability. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America has compiled &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://adaa.org/finding-help/coronavirus-anxiety-helpful-resources&quot;&gt;a list of trusted resources&lt;/a&gt; and expert tips. Taking care of your mental health is a vital part of ensuring that your kids and teens navigate this time successfully. We know from well-established scientific studies that children’s mental health improves when parents seek mental health care first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/mother-little-son-sitting-windowsill_6632009.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;by prostooleh via Freepik&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/a-guide-to-parent-self-care-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/&quot;&gt;A guide to parent self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620455710/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620455710/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620455710/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/the-story-of-covid-19-by-the-numbers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The story of COVID-19, by the numbers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/lessons-for-the-coronavirus-from-the-1899-honolulu-plague/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lessons for the coronavirus from the 1899 Honolulu plague&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-we-can-equip-ourselves-against-climate-change/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How we can equip ourselves against climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-how-antibody-blood-tests-work"/>
		<id>https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3086485</id>
		<updated>2020-03-27T19:03:12+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom has ordered 3.5
million antibody tests, which would show whether someone has been exposed to COVID-19.
Such tests, which just take a drop of blood, could help reveal people who have
been exposed to the virus and are now likely immune, meaning they could go back
to work and resume their normal lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Antibodies are proteins that the body’s
white blood cells produce to fight an infection. They bind to a virus,
preventing it from infecting a cell, and can remain in blood long after the
infection clears. Antibody tests are commonly used to test for exposure to
other viruses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;
spoke with David Weiner, director of the Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center at the
Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, and Charles Cairns, dean of the Drexel University
College of Medicine, about how antibody tests work and what are some of the
challenges of developing the tests. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The
following responses have been edited for brevity and clarity. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: What does
an antibody test do?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cairns:&lt;/strong&gt;  Antibody tests look to see if someone has
been exposed to a specific antigen, like a virus. The British tests are designed to work in one of two ways. They
either detect human antibodies in blood using an antigen designed to be similar
to a feature of the virus. Or conversely, the test detects the virus in blood
using a [human-made] antibody designed to trap the virus.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: How is it
different from tests that diagnose an infection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cairns:&lt;/strong&gt;  Diagnostic tests are
using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-testing-diagnostic-covid19-united-states?utm_source=Coronavirus_Update&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cvupdate032720&quot;&gt;RT-PCR tests&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN:
3/6/20&lt;/em&gt;). You take a nasal swab (or sputum sample) that identifies the
specific viral RNA from the COVID-19 virus. 
It’s the gold standard to see if you are actively infected. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The
antibody tests are quick — a prick of blood and you get a yes/no answer. You’ve
had COVID-19 or you haven’t. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: Why do antibody
tests matter? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weiner:  &lt;/strong&gt;People
who have recovered won’t have RT-PCR positive tests, as they’ve already cleared
the virus. Those who are recovered, those antibodies protect them from
reinfection. (It’s still unclear, however, how long that immunity might last.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re now screening to find people who are positive [and have a current infection]. But it’s important to find people who have recovered and who are unlikely to be reinfected, so they can go out and be the buffers for the rest of us. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-when-will-coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing-end&quot;&gt;That’s how herd immunity develops&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/24/20&lt;/em&gt;).  Antibody tests also give us a better idea of how many people have been infected and how many have recovered, so we can start to move forward. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: Who
should be prioritized for getting this test?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weiner:&lt;/strong&gt; I think the first responders and health care workers
should be screened first, because it’s very important for them [to feel
confident] to get back out on the front line.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: What is
the status of providing widespread antibody testing in the United States? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cairns:&lt;/strong&gt; There are lots of people working on [antibody] tests [in
the United States]. But you’re trying to replicate a gold standard — the RT-PCR
test — with a test that uses smaller amounts of sample, is faster and is available
outside the lab.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The big question is: Does a positive response for the antibodies mean that person is actively infected, or that they have been infected in the past? The tests need to be accurate, and avoid both false positives and false negatives. That’s the challenge.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://xcorr.net/2020/03/27/reverse-correlation-linearizing-black-box-functions/"/>
		<id>http://xcorr.net/?p=7315</id>
		<updated>2020-03-27T17:58:47+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;Reverse correlation is a tried-and-tested nonlinear systems identification method to understand biological neurons. The idea is to open the black box that is a biological neuron by using random stimuli to probe how the neuron responds. We present a series of random stimuli to a sensory neuron. By averaging those that generated a response, we obtain the spike-triggered average. The spike-triggered average is equal to the weights of a linear filter that approximates the response of a neuron. Under this linearity assumption, it is also a neuron’s preferred stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Reverse correlation in a nutshell. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Illustration_diagram_for_the_Spike-triggered_average.pdf&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/sta.jpeg&quot; /&gt;Reverse correlation in a nutshell. Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Illustration_diagram_for_the_Spike-triggered_average.pdf&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reverse correlation has fallen out of favour as people have graduated to more complex models (e.g. GLMs and deep nets) with more complex stimuli (natural scenes) to probe brain representations. However, the machinery underlying reverse correlation is making somewhat of an unexpected comeback in different corners of machine learning. This is something that I’m sure will surprise many machine learning people as well as neuroscientists. Digging deeper into these subfields yields some insights on improvements in nonlinear systems identification that we can take back to computational neuroscience. In this article, I discuss two of these ideas:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;evolution strategies, which are black-box optimization methods&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;locally interpretable models, which are linearization models to open up black box models like deep neural nets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before I dig into these methods, let’s dig into the theory behind reverse correlation so we can understand its deep structure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;The theory behind reverse correlation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reverse correlation seemed pretty magical when I first encountered it! Put noise into a system, measure responses – out comes the kernel (?!). I ended up &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/thesis-superduperfinal.pdf&quot;&gt;writing my PhD thesis on systems identification&lt;/a&gt;, so you’d think that by the time I graduated my thinking on this was solidified. In the years since, I’ve found that reverse correlation is actually pretty darn subtle, and I’ve developed a new appreciation for all the subtle aspects of the technique.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a good exposition of the ideas behind reverse correlation in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/neco.2006.18.12.3097&quot;&gt;Franz &amp;amp; Schölkopf (2006)&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s say that we are trying to characterize a nonlinear system that receives &lt;img alt=&quot;N&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;N&quot; /&gt; real inputs and outputs a noisy scalar &lt;img alt=&quot;y&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;y&quot; /&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\mathbb E [y|x] = f(\bold x) \newline \text{where } \bold x \in \mathbb R^N&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+E+%5By%7Cx%5D+%3D+f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%5Cnewline+%5Ctext%7Bwhere+%7D+%5Cbold+x+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb+R%5EN&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\mathbb E [y|x] = f(\bold x) \newline \text{where } \bold x \in \mathbb R^N&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, under certain regularity conditions, we can write the mean response function of the system &lt;img alt=&quot;f(\bold x)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;f(\bold x)&quot; /&gt; as a polynomial expansion, the Volterra expansion:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;f(\bold x) \approx h_0 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T \cdot h_1 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T h_2 (\bold x - \bold x_0) + \ldots&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%5Capprox+h_0+%2B+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29%5ET+%5Ccdot+h_1+%2B+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29%5ET+h_2+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29+%2B+%5Cldots&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;f(\bold x) \approx h_0 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T \cdot h_1 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T h_2 (\bold x - \bold x_0) + \ldots&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note that the kernels &lt;img alt=&quot;h_i&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_i&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;h_i&quot; /&gt; have increasing order: &lt;img alt=&quot;h_0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;h_0&quot; /&gt; is a scalar, &lt;img alt=&quot;h_1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;h_1&quot; /&gt; a vector, &lt;img alt=&quot;h_2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;h_2&quot; /&gt; a matrix, &lt;img alt=&quot;h_3&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_3&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;h_3&quot; /&gt; a three-index tensor, etc. The form of the expansion is similar to a Taylor expansion, and it’s tempting to identify the two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misconception: the Volterra expansion is a Taylor expansion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Volterra expansion is more general than a Taylor expansion: a Taylor expansion requires well-defined derivatives to every order, while a Volterra expansion does not. For example, the function &lt;img alt=&quot;f(x) = \exp(-1/x^2)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29+%3D+%5Cexp%28-1%2Fx%5E2%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;f(x) = \exp(-1/x^2)&quot; /&gt; has 0 derivatives everywhere. Hence, its Taylor expansion around 0 is exactly 0. However, it has a perfectly good non-null Volterra expansion, which can be found through polynomial regression. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Expansion-Schmexpansion.ipynb&quot;&gt;Here’s a notebook that shows you how it’s done&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Approximating a function with zero derivatives with a Volterra expansion&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/volterra2.png&quot; /&gt;Approximating a function with a null Taylor series with polynomials.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This subtle difference might seem like some nit-picking, but in practice, it is very important: discontinuous functions and stochastic functions can both be approximated with Volterra series. Biological Neurons are both stochastic and have potentially very sharp nonlinearities, yet we can still approximate them using a Volterra expansion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wiener expansion is an orthogonalized version of the Volterra expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To estimate the coefficients of the Volterra expansion, conventional reverse correlation first rearranges the Volterra expansion into an equivalent series of functionals, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_series&quot;&gt;Wiener expansion&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;f(\bold x) = \sum_i G_i[\bold x]&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%3D+%5Csum_i+G_i%5B%5Cbold+x%5D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;f(\bold x) = \sum_i G_i[\bold x]&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And imposes that these functionals are orthogonal to each other:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\mathbb E_D[G_i(x)G_j(x)] = 0 \text{ for } i \ne j&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+E_D%5BG_i%28x%29G_j%28x%29%5D+%3D+0+%5Ctext%7B+for+%7D+i+%5Cne+j&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\mathbb E_D[G_i(x)G_j(x)] = 0 \text{ for } i \ne j&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;img alt=&quot;D&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;D&quot; /&gt; is the data distribution. Orthogonality is imposed via a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;img alt=&quot;G_0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_0&quot; /&gt; to the output of the Volterra kernel of order 0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;img alt=&quot;G_1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_1&quot; /&gt; to the output of the Volterra kernel of order 1, and back-project &lt;img alt=&quot;G_0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_0&quot; /&gt; from &lt;img alt=&quot;G_1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_1&quot; /&gt; to make &lt;img alt=&quot;G_1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_1&quot; /&gt; orthogonal to &lt;img alt=&quot;G_0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;img alt=&quot;G_2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_2&quot; /&gt; to the output of the Volterra kernel of order 2, and back-project &lt;img alt=&quot;G_0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_0&quot; /&gt; and &lt;img alt=&quot;G_1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_1&quot; /&gt; from &lt;img alt=&quot;G_2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_2&quot; /&gt; to make &lt;img alt=&quot;G_2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_2&quot; /&gt; orthogonal to both, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the itty-bitty subtle bit: it turns out that the expectations of every order are straightforward to calculate when the data distribution &lt;img alt=&quot;D&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;D&quot; /&gt; is normal. The 0’th order and 1st order functionals are simply the constant and linear Volterra kernels. The 2nd order functional is the quadratic kernel minus a correction for the diagonal terms of the kernel, since the square of a normally-distributed variable distribution has a mean equal to the square of the standard deviation, &lt;img alt=&quot;\mathbb E[x^2] = \sigma^2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+E%5Bx%5E2%5D+%3D+%5Csigma%5E2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\mathbb E[x^2] = \sigma^2&quot; /&gt;. Thus:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;G_0 = k_0 \newline G_1 = (x - x_0)^T k_1 \newline G_2 = (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) - \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj}\newline&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0+%3D+k_0+%5Cnewline+G_1+%3D+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_1+%5Cnewline+G_2+%3D+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_2+%28x+-+x_0%29+-+%5Csigma%5E2+%5Csum_j+k_2%5E%7Bjj%7D%5Cnewline&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_0 = k_0 \newline G_1 = (x - x_0)^T k_1 \newline G_2 = (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) - \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj}\newline&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since each functional are orthogonal over the data distribution, we can easily calculate them using an iterative procedure:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Estimate the Wiener kernel &lt;img alt=&quot;k_0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;k_0&quot; /&gt; from the measured response &lt;img alt=&quot;y&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;y&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Project the 0’th order functional out of &lt;img alt=&quot;y&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;y&quot; /&gt; to obtain &lt;img alt=&quot;y_{res}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bres%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;y_{res}&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Estimate the Wiener kernel &lt;img alt=&quot;k_1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;k_1&quot; /&gt; from the residual &lt;img alt=&quot;y_{res}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bres%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;y_{res}&quot; /&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimating Wiener series with white noise means finding estimates that minimize sum-of-squares between prediction and measurement over the stimulus ensemble. We use a few shortcuts enabled by properties of white noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What does &lt;em&gt;estimate&lt;/em&gt; mean in this context? Least-squares! To estimate the zero-order kernel, we have:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\hat k_0 = \arg \min_{k_0} \sum(y - k_0)^2 = \bar y&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat+k_0+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bk_0%7D+%5Csum%28y+-+k_0%29%5E2+%3D+%5Cbar+y&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\hat k_0 = \arg \min_{k_0} \sum(y - k_0)^2 = \bar y&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first-order kernel:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\hat k_1 = \arg \min_{k_1} \sum(y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T k_1 )^2 \newline = ((x - x_0)^T (x-x_0))^{-1} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y) \newline \approx \frac{1}{N \sigma^2} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat+k_1+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bk_1%7D+%5Csum%28y+-+%5Cbar+y+-+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_1+%29%5E2+%5Cnewline+%3D+%28%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+%28x-x_0%29%29%5E%7B-1%7D+%28x-x_0%29%5ET+%28y+-+%5Cbar+y%29+%5Cnewline+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN+%5Csigma%5E2%7D+%28x-x_0%29%5ET+%28y+-+%5Cbar+y%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\hat k_1 = \arg \min_{k_1} \sum(y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T k_1 )^2 \newline = ((x - x_0)^T (x-x_0))^{-1} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y) \newline \approx \frac{1}{N \sigma^2} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here the approximate sign comes from the fact that with normally distributed data, &lt;img alt=&quot;(x - x_0)^T (x-x_0) \approx N\sigma^2 I&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+%28x-x_0%29+%5Capprox+N%5Csigma%5E2+I&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;(x - x_0)^T (x-x_0) \approx N\sigma^2 I&quot; /&gt;. The second order kernel is a little more tricky. We first define &lt;img alt=&quot;r = y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+y+-+%5Cbar+y+-+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;r = y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T&quot; /&gt;. Then:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;k_2 = \arg \min_{k_2} \sum \left(r - (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) + \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj} \right)^2 \newline = \text{unstack}((D^T D)^{-1} D^T r) \newline&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_2+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bk_2%7D+%5Csum+%5Cleft%28r+-+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_2+%28x+-+x_0%29+%2B+%5Csigma%5E2+%5Csum_j+k_2%5E%7Bjj%7D+%5Cright%29%5E2+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Ctext%7Bunstack%7D%28%28D%5ET+D%29%5E%7B-1%7D+D%5ET+r%29+%5Cnewline&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;k_2 = \arg \min_{k_2} \sum \left(r - (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) + \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj} \right)^2 \newline = \text{unstack}((D^T D)^{-1} D^T r) \newline&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The columns of the matrix &lt;img alt=&quot;D&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;D&quot; /&gt; is composed of all the cross-products &lt;img alt=&quot;x_i x_j - \delta_{ij} \sigma^2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i+x_j+-+%5Cdelta_%7Bij%7D+%5Csigma%5E2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;x_i x_j - \delta_{ij} \sigma^2&quot; /&gt; for &lt;img alt=&quot;i \ge j&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cge+j&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;i \ge j&quot; /&gt;. The operator &lt;img alt=&quot;\text{unstack}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7Bunstack%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\text{unstack}&quot; /&gt; takes this linear representation of the coefficients and transforms them into a matrix. Here again, we find that for normally distributed inputs, the non-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix &lt;img alt=&quot;D^TD&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%5ETD&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;D^TD&quot; /&gt; have an expected value of zero. The inverse of the diagonal is a bit more tricky to calculate, but a little bit of grinding shows that we pick up a scalar factor &lt;img alt=&quot;\frac{1}{2!\sigma^{4}}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%21%5Csigma%5E%7B4%7D%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\frac{1}{2!\sigma^{4}}&quot; /&gt;. In fact, we can show that the estimate of the kernels can be written as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;k_i(j_1, j_2, \ldots j_i) = \frac{1}{i!\sigma^{2i}N} [y - \sum_{m=0}^{i-1} G_m(\mathbf x)] x_{j_1} x_{j_2} \ldots x_{j_i}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_i%28j_1%2C+j_2%2C+%5Cldots+j_i%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bi%21%5Csigma%5E%7B2i%7DN%7D+%5By+-+%5Csum_%7Bm%3D0%7D%5E%7Bi-1%7D+G_m%28%5Cmathbf+x%29%5D+x_%7Bj_1%7D+x_%7Bj_2%7D+%5Cldots+x_%7Bj_i%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;k_i(j_1, j_2, \ldots j_i) = \frac{1}{i!\sigma^{2i}N} [y - \sum_{m=0}^{i-1} G_m(\mathbf x)] x_{j_1} x_{j_2} \ldots x_{j_i}&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;img alt=&quot;G_j&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_j&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G_j&quot; /&gt; are the orthogonalized Wiener functionals (equation 2, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3382067&quot;&gt;Korenberg et al. 1988&lt;/a&gt;). Notice the &lt;img alt=&quot;i!&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%21&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;i!&quot; /&gt; factors, which look an awful lot like a Taylor expansion. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Second-order-estimate.ipynb&quot;&gt;This formula actually works! Here’s a notebook to show you how it’s done for a second order Wiener expansion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Is your head spinning yet? Mine sure was! Grinding through the kernels one by one makes a few things clear:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wiener-Volterra analysis isn’t magic. It’s orthogonal polynomial regression estimated through least-squares, with approximations that are enabled by the use of a very special distribution of the inputs, the normal distribution. This means that expectations of different moments can be analytically calculated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Wiener kernel definitions change when you change the distribution of the input. This is because orthogonalization is dependent on the input distribution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The easy estimation of the kernels via backprojection and simple multiplication with cross-products of the inputs is lost when the input distribution is not normal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The special properties of white noise were very important technically in 1958 when the series was proposed: the kernels could be estimated with very minimal computing resources. A memoryless accumulator is sufficient. Today, we’re no longer bound by these limitations, and we can do Wiener-Volterra analysis in a much wider range of contexts. Casting Wiener-Volterra analysis as polynomial regression fit via least-squares immediately opens up many extensions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finding better estimates via the minimum variance unbiased estimator, that is, maximum likelihood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finding better estimates by better modeling the noise, for example, taking into account the Poisson nature of neural noise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generalizing to non-normally distributed ensembles of inputs, again using maximum likelihood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using alternative expansions, for example, cascades of linear-nonlinear filters (i.e. deep nets), fit with stochastic gradient descent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, some of the ideas behind Wiener-Volterra theory – local polynomial expansion, probing stimuli at random – have made their way into far-flung machine learning methods. Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Evolution strategies (ES)&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Evolution_strategies&quot;&gt;Evolution strategies&lt;/a&gt; (ES) are a family of black-box, gradient-free optimizers for potentially non-differentiable functions. At the heart of most optimizers over continuous variables is the computation of the gradient. If the gradient is unaccessible because of discontinuities, or because it is very expensive to calculate, we can obtain a &lt;em&gt;smoothed&lt;/em&gt; gradient via the ES method.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The setup is quite clever. We have a function &lt;img alt=&quot;f&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;f&quot; /&gt; that we are trying to optimize. Instead of computing its derivative &lt;img alt=&quot;\nabla f(z)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+f%28z%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\nabla f(z)&quot; /&gt; directly, we compute the derivative of the expectation of the function, &lt;img alt=&quot;\mathbb \nabla \mathbb E_\pi[f(z)]&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+%5Cnabla+%5Cmathbb+E_%5Cpi%5Bf%28z%29%5D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\mathbb \nabla \mathbb E_\pi[f(z)]&quot; /&gt; in a local neighborhood &lt;img alt=&quot;\pi(\theta, z)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%28%5Ctheta%2C+z%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\pi(\theta, z)&quot; /&gt;. Think of this expectation as a smoothed derivative.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To compute the expected value, we expand it via its definition, and obtain:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\nabla_\theta \mathbb E_\pi(z, \theta)[f(z)] = \nabla \int \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \log \pi(z, \theta) \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla_%5Ctheta+%5Cmathbb+E_%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%5Bf%28z%29%5D+%3D+%5Cnabla+%5Cint+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cint+%5Cnabla+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cint+%5Cnabla+%5Clog+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\nabla_\theta \mathbb E_\pi(z, \theta)[f(z)] = \nabla \int \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \log \pi(z, \theta) \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The last equality, which is also called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.shakirm.com/2015/11/machine-learning-trick-of-the-day-5-log-derivative-trick/&quot;&gt;log-derivative trick&lt;/a&gt;, is derived from:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\nabla \log \pi(z,\theta) = \frac{\nabla \pi(z, \theta)}{\pi(z, \theta)}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+%5Clog+%5Cpi%28z%2C%5Ctheta%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cnabla+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%7D%7B%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\nabla \log \pi(z,\theta) = \frac{\nabla \pi(z, \theta)}{\pi(z, \theta)}&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A neighbourhood which is often used in practice is the isotropic Gaussian centered at $\mu$ with a standard deviation $\sigma$. If we take a Monte Carlo estimate of the expectation, we find an approximation for the gradient as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\nabla \mathbb E[f] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \nabla_\mu \log N(\mu, \sigma^2) \newline = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \frac{1}{\sigma^2} (z-\mu) f(z)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+%5Cmathbb+E%5Bf%5D+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN%7D+%5Csum_%7B1%7D%5EN+%5Cnabla_%5Cmu+%5Clog+N%28%5Cmu%2C+%5Csigma%5E2%29+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN%7D+%5Csum_%7B1%7D%5EN+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7D+%28z-%5Cmu%29+f%28z%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\nabla \mathbb E[f] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \nabla_\mu \log N(\mu, \sigma^2) \newline = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \frac{1}{\sigma^2} (z-\mu) f(z)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice this remarkable equation: this is exactly the response-triggered average with an isotropic gaussian stimulus ensemble. This reveals an unexpected link between reverse correlation and optimization: we can view reverse correlation as estimating an approximate gradient of the response function of a neuron.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The response-triggered average tells us how we should change a stimulus locally to increase the response of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Taking ES to reverse correlation&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;From the OpenAI blog, https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/es.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies/&quot;&gt;From the OpenAI blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The unexpected link between reverse correlation and optimization opens up a lot of different avenues. For instance, we could adapt ES to maximize the response of a neuron in a closed-loop fashion. This strategy has the advantage of being trivial to compute and highly intuitive (i.e. no complaints from reviewer 2 about the method being inscrutable).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ES is also embarrassingly parallel, which has been used to good effect in the context of reinforcement learning – OpenAI showcased ES with 1024 parallel evaluations. We could consider evaluating the gradient of a neuron’s response function in parallel with several other neurons – perhaps in a different animal, in a different lab – and optimize for a stimulus that maximizes the sum of the responses. Indeed, we don’t have to focus on maximizing just the mean response of a neuron: we can maximize the diversity of responses, their dimensionality, etc. This works as long as the metric that we’re measuring is a scalar function of the measured responses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ES comes in a variety of different flavours that aim to increase the efficiency of the method. Two of the most popular variants are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES&quot;&gt;CMA-ES (Covariance-matrix-adaptation)&lt;/a&gt;. This takes the derivative of the neighborhood with respect to the covariance of the normal distribution, in addition to its mean. Thus, the covariance stimulus ensemble is tweaked to capture the largest dimensions of descent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/wierstra14a.html&quot;&gt;NES (Natural evolution strategies)&lt;/a&gt;. This uses natural gradients rather than gradients, which naturally deals with rescaling of the axes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both of these more efficient variants could be applied to find preferred stimuli in a population of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, because the ES objective is a Monte Carlo estimate, we can import many of the tricks from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_reduction&quot;&gt;variance reduction literature&lt;/a&gt; to increase the efficiency of reverse correlation. For example, we can use control variates or use stratified sampling strategies. My favourite trick to increase the efficiency of estimation: pairing every stimulus with its negative. With this trick, the mean of the realized stimulus ensemble is exactly the mean of the distribution. &lt;a href=&quot;https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Paired-sampling.ipynb&quot;&gt;This antithetic sampling can, in some circumstances, increase the efficiency of the estimation of the preferred stimulus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Locally interpretable models&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s another area where the ideas underlying reverse correlation have recently come together: &lt;a href=&quot;https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/lime.html&quot;&gt;locally interpretable models&lt;/a&gt;. Suppose that we have a complex black-box model that we are trying to better understand. This black box model can be, for example, a deep neural network. We can locally approximate this complex function with a simpler, local expansion. This local explanation does not capture all the subtleties of the model, but it can reveal insights that are useful for humans that want to understand the model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black-box models are good for predictions by machines. White-box models are good for understanding by humans. LIME transforms black-box models into locally white-box models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Toy example to present intuition for LIME.The black-box model’s complex decision function f(unknown to LIME) is represented by the blue/pinkbackground, which cannot be approximated well bya linear model. The bold red cross is the instancebeing explained. LIME samples instances, gets pre-dictions using f, and weighs them by the proximityto the instance being explained (represented hereby size). The dashed line is the learned explanationthat is locally (but not globally) faithful. From Ribeiro et al. 2016&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/lime-caption.png&quot; /&gt;From the LIME paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938&quot;&gt;Ribeiro et al. 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In general, we try to find a model &lt;img alt=&quot;g&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;g&quot; /&gt; which approximates a complex function &lt;img alt=&quot;f&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;f&quot; /&gt; according to a weight window &lt;img alt=&quot;\pi&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\pi&quot; /&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;\arg \min_{g\in G} L(f, g, \pi) + \Omega(g)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bg%5Cin+G%7D+L%28f%2C+g%2C+%5Cpi%29+%2B+%5COmega%28g%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\arg \min_{g\in G} L(f, g, \pi) + \Omega(g)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;img alt=&quot;L&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;L&quot; /&gt; is a loss function and &lt;img alt=&quot;\Omega(g)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28g%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\Omega(g)&quot; /&gt; captures the complexity of &lt;img alt=&quot;g&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;g&quot; /&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=7315&amp;amp;action=edit&quot;&gt;In LIME, or locally interpretable model explanations&lt;/a&gt;, the authors suggest to use a Gaussian-shaped neighborhood around an anchor &lt;img alt=&quot;a&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;a&quot; /&gt;, and a sum-of-squares loss, leading to the weighted loss:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;L = \sum_i \exp \left(-\frac{||x_i - a||^2}{\sigma^2} \right) (f(x_i) - g(x_i)) ^ 2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L+%3D+%5Csum_i+%5Cexp+%5Cleft%28-%5Cfrac%7B%7C%7Cx_i+-+a%7C%7C%5E2%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7D+%5Cright%29+%28f%28x_i%29+-+g%28x_i%29%29+%5E+2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;L = \sum_i \exp \left(-\frac{||x_i - a||^2}{\sigma^2} \right) (f(x_i) - g(x_i)) ^ 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several choices are possible for &lt;img alt=&quot;\Omega(g)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28g%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\Omega(g)&quot; /&gt;. For example, we may privilege functions that focus on few input dimensions; we can impose that &lt;img alt=&quot;g&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;g&quot; /&gt; is sparse in parameter space using an L1 penalty as &lt;img alt=&quot;\Omega(g)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28g%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;\Omega(g)&quot; /&gt;. The model class &lt;img alt=&quot;G&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;amp;s=0&quot; title=&quot;G&quot; /&gt; can be anything that is “easy to interpret” for humans. This could mean:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a GAM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a decision tree&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a linear model&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we choose no penalty for complexity and choose a linear model class, our model and error function is equivalent to reverse correlation and evolutionary strategies. This highlight something that’s underappreciated about reverse correlation:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spike-triggered average is a simplified, locally valid explanation for how a neuron works. While complex models like deep nets can capture more of the variance in the data, the goal in reverse correlation is different: explaining neurons to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Taking LIME to reverse correlation&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An underappreciated fact about reverse correlation is that the size of the neighbourhood around which we’re linearizing is arbitrary and that different neighbourhoods will lead to different estimates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many articles have documented that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/31/6991.short&quot;&gt;receptive fields appear to change with changing stimulus ensembles&lt;/a&gt;, for example natural vs. artificial stimuli. However, this has been explained in terms of a special, adaptive response of neurons to natural image statistics; for instance, that they increase the degree of feedforward inhibition they receive. In fact, the same phenomenon could happen simply because we’re measuring a nonlinear function, so that its locally linear expansion depends on the stimulus ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of the parameters of the probing distribution are arbitrary:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the size of the neighborhood (big vs. small)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the shape of the neighborhood (isotropic Gaussian vs. non-isotropic vs. natural stimuli)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the center of the neighborhood (gray image or another reference)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the most interesting applications of nonlinear systems identification have manipulated each of these factors. For example, by shifting the center of the neighbourhood to an appropriate anchor point, we can locally linearize quadratic responses (i.e. complex cells) by choosing an appropriate anchor point. This is the idea behind Movshon et al. (1978), where the line weighting function of a complex cell is found by using another line in the center as an anchor:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Local linearization of receptive fields&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/movshon-1978.png&quot; /&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1113/jphysiol.1978.sp012489&quot;&gt;Movshon et al. 1978&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are some other excellent nuggets in the LIME paper that could serve us well. For instance, they suggest using a maximally diverse ensemble of examples (SP-LIME) to illustrate the functioning of the models to humans. &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10589&quot;&gt;A similar idea was used in Cadena et al. (2018) to visualize diverse features&lt;/a&gt; that triggered large responses in early stages of a deep neural net around an anchor point (invariant or equivariant features).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can have our cake and eat it too: we can fit very complex models of neurons that explain much of the variance in sensory systems using deep nets, and visualize how these models work using locally linear explanations. It sounds a little silly to fit a model to a model, but it’s a technique that has been used fruitfully both to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/109/16/E972.short&quot;&gt;explain sensory neurons&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531&quot;&gt;compress neural networks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both ES and LIME use local linearization strategies similar to reverse correlation to explain complex black box function. From ES, we learn that the reverse correlation estimate gives us a local approximation for the gradient, which can be used as a starting point for closed-loop experiments. From LIME, we see that we can perform reverse correlation centered around different neighbourhoods, yielding different results. By following these new research trends in machine learning, we can find innovative ways of opening the black boxes that are biological neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As COVID-19 sweeps across the United States, hospitals are running
out of masks, gowns and eye protection. New supplies aren’t being made fast
enough to keep up with demand, and stockpiles seem &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/amid-mounting-shortage-5-facts-about-the-nations-stockpile-of-emergency-m/574602/&quot;&gt;insufficient&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is no bailout,” says David Witt, an infectious
disease specialist and epidemiologist at Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical
Center in California. “There is no military supply. There is no national
stockpile that will suffice. It’s not coming from another country in aid.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mask-making company 3M is &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.3m.com/blog/3m-stories/3m-responds-2019-novel-coronavirus&quot;&gt;ramping
up&lt;/a&gt; production, and other companies, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/24/820622038/automaker-retools-with-health-supply-companies-to-make-masks-ventilators&quot;&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;,
are pitching in. But these efforts will take time. Meanwhile, carpenters,
clothing companies and local sewing circles are stepping up to help.
Crowdsourcing efforts such as #getmePPE and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.providence.org/lp/100m-masks&quot;&gt;100 Million Mask Challenge&lt;/a&gt;
are seeking to fill supply gaps in face masks, goggles and other personal
protective equipment, or PPE. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An editorial published March 20 in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; requested &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763590&quot;&gt;creative ideas&lt;/a&gt;.
Proposals have flooded in with predominant themes emerging on how to reuse the face
masks called N95s, thick, tight-fitting masks that can block tiny virus
particles, and how to make alternatives to commercial ones. The innovation on
display convinced surgeon Ed Livingston, a coauthor of the editorial and an
editor at &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, that “this is the
biomedical engineering community’s Apollo 13 moment.” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In this fast-moving emergency, it’s unclear which homespun
efforts will help the most. Here’s what we know, and don’t know, about how to
best conserve the PPE that we have and how to make more. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;Make supplies last longer &lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hospitals are asking for donations from anyone who might have PPE on hand, including construction workers, dentists and spa workers. Wearing a single mask for multiple patients is “something that we would normally never do,” Witt says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though that practice is not ideal, it might not be terrible.
Masks don’t necessarily pick up a lot of contamination, a small study finds. Researchers
in Singapore swabbed N95 face masks, goggles and shoes of 30 health care
workers as they exited rooms of 15 patients with COVID-19. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/infection-control-and-hospital-epidemiology/article/absence-of-contamination-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe-by-severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2-sarscov2/EA37207FECDD23BE900526CEE5BA9430&quot;&gt;No
viral genetic material was detected&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers report March 26 in &lt;em&gt;Infection Control &amp;amp; Hospital
Epidemiology&lt;/em&gt;, suggesting that extended use of masks and goggles might work,
in certain conditions. The study might have missed some virus on masks due to
the limited way researchers tested the masks. And the patients were in
isolation rooms with 12 air exchanges per hour. Conditions differ at other
health care facilities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Assuming reused masks are bound to get some level of contamination,
others have been exploring how to best disinfect masks. Time is a powerful
disinfectant; infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19
illness, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2004973&quot;&gt;plummets&lt;/a&gt;
after two to three days on hard surfaces. The virus lasts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-questions-covid19-symptoms-deaths-spread&quot;&gt;even
less time&lt;/a&gt; on other surfaces (&lt;em&gt;SN:
3/4/20&lt;/em&gt;). Some researchers have recommended rotating through a series of
masks, so that worn masks can “rest” and passively become virus-free again. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other suggestions include heat, chemical disinfectants and
ultraviolet light. At the University of Nebraska Medical Center, health care
workers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nebraskamed.com/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19/n-95-decon-process.pdf&quot;&gt;hang
up strings of used masks &lt;/a&gt;in a room with two UV light towers. After a
treatment of about five minutes, the masks are ready to be used again. The
approach is experimental, and it’s not clear whether multiple rounds of UV light
damages the masks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Health care worker wearing PPE&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3086444&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/032620_LS_covid-masks_inline-680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3086444&quot;&gt;SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, infects people through the eyes, nose and mouth. Face shields, goggles, gloves and gowns protect health care workers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3086444&quot;&gt;Sturti/E+/Getty Images plus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Make masks at home &lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s new crisis
guidelines to health care workers says that where no face masks are available,
homemade masks, made of bandannas or scarves, for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/face-masks.html&quot;&gt;can
be used as a last resort&lt;/a&gt;.“That’s
how desperate they are, that they said that,” Livingston says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cloth masks aren’t ideal. A 2015 study of over 1,000
healthcare workers in Hanoi, Vietnam, found that those who were assigned to
wear cloth masks were &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006577&quot;&gt;more
likely to get a respiratory virus&lt;/a&gt; than those who wore medical masks, made
of thick fibers that catch a range of particles. That study appeared in &lt;em&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, homemade cloth masks are better than nothing. “Is it
as good as [masks from] medical grade, quality-controlled, assured storage,
temperature-controlled warehouse? Probably not,” Witt says. “Is it good enough?
Absolutely.” A 2008 study of homemade cloth masks worn by members of the
general public, published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;,
backs that up, finding that though imperfect, homemade masks can &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002618&quot;&gt;offer
some protection&lt;/a&gt; against viral particles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mask needs to strike a balance between filtering
capabilities and breathability. Some materials, such as vacuum bags, are better
at filtering than others, a 2013 study in &lt;em&gt;Disaster
Medicine and Public Health&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Preparedness
&lt;/em&gt;suggests. But vacuum bags are hard to breathe through. Cotton T-shirts
offer a breathable fabric that filtered microorganisms &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/0921A05A69A9419C862FA2F35F819D55/S1935789313000438a.pdf/testing_the_efficacy_of_homemade_masks_would_they_protect_in_an_influenza_pandemic.pdf&quot;&gt;roughly
half as well&lt;/a&gt; as a surgical masks in those experiments.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other work-arounds focus on 3-D printing, which can churn
out hard, clear face shields that protect health care workers’ eyes and possibly
extend the life of face masks. That’s what the Qualcomm Institute at the
University of California, San Diego is attempting to do. “Improvised visors
with some 3D-printed parts seem the most feasible,” say engineer Ramesh Rao,
the institute’s director. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Get creative &lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response to the &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;
editorial’s call for ideas, several health care workers suggested scuba masks.
They’re durable enough to be sterilized, they protect the eyes, nose and mouth,
and best of all, they channel air through a small tube that a filter can be
placed in. “Why not?” Livingston says. “It makes sense.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Livingston and colleagues are digging through the ideas, talking with experts and hoping to update people with guidance soon. But for now, “I don’t think anyone can say what’s right or wrong,” he says. “People need to do their best.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A suspected subsurface ocean
on Pluto might be old and deep. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New analyses of images from NASA’s
New Horizons spacecraft suggest that the dwarf planet has had an underground
ocean since shortly after Pluto formed 4.5 billion years ago, and that the ocean
may surround and interact with the rocky core.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If so, oceans could be
common at the solar system’s edge — and may even be able to support life. That
possibly “transforms the way we think about the Kuiper Belt,” the region of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kuiper-belt-dust-earth-atmosphere-nasa-labs-right-now&quot;&gt;icy objects beyond the orbit of Neptune&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/27/19&lt;/em&gt;), says planetary scientist Adeene
Denton of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On its pass through the
Kuiper Belt in 2015, New Horizons revealed that despite the dwarf planet’s location
nearly 6 billion kilometers from the sun, Pluto showed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/salty-sea-could-lurk-beneath-heart-pluto&quot;&gt;signs of hosting an ocean&lt;/a&gt; of liquid water beneath an icy shell (&lt;em&gt;SN: 9/23/16&lt;/em&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How much liquid may lie
beneath Pluto’s ground, how long it’s been there, and how much the water may
have partially frozen over time is hard to tell from the surface. The new
research, which had been scheduled for presentation the week of March 16 at the
canceled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2020/pdf/1497.pdf&quot;&gt;Lunar and Planetary Science Conference&lt;/a&gt; in The Woodlands, Texas, has dug into those questions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pluto's surface&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3086289&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/032020_lg_pluto_inline1_map_rev.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3086289&quot;&gt;Dark lines (circled) on the surface of Pluto, shown in this image from NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft, could mark ripples created when a large object probably slammed into the opposite side of the dwarf planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3086289&quot;&gt;New Horizons Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If there’s an ocean today,
it raises the question of, when did that ocean get there?” says planetary scientist
Carver Bierson of the University of California, Santa Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bierson considered two
possible histories for Pluto’s potential ocean. If the dwarf planet had a “cold
start,” any subsurface water would first have been frozen before melting under heat
from decaying radioactive elements in the dwarf planet’s core, only to
partially freeze again over time. In that scenario, Bierson expected to see
cracks and ripples across Pluto’s icy shell from the orb’s contraction as the
ice melted and then expansion as water refroze. Contracting would make the ice
crumple into mountainlike features, while expanding would stretch the ice and
create faults and graben. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Bierson’s second scenario
envisioned a “warm start” for Pluto, where the ocean would have been liquid for
nearly all of Pluto’s 4.5-billion-year existence. In that case, the surface
would show only cracks from the sea expanding as it partially froze. And that’s
exactly what Bierson and colleagues found in New Horizon’s images, suggesting that
Pluto’s liquid ocean is nearly as old as the dwarf planet itself.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That means maybe Pluto did
start off warm,” Bierson says. “Maybe it started with a liquid ocean really
early on.” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In a separate study, Denton
and colleagues considered the impact that formed Sputnik Planitia, the left
lobe of Pluto’s distinctive heart-shaped basin. Because of how New Horizons
flew past Pluto, scientists’ view of half the dwarf planet is fuzzy. But the
team was able to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08833&quot;&gt;lines on Pluto’s surface on the exact opposite side of
the globe from Sputnik Planitia&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers
reported in October 2019 at arXiv.org. Those
lines might be the imprints of shock waves from a massive impact that formed the
enormous basin, Denton says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If the impact is large
enough … the planet itself can act like a lens, and focus the wave energy at
the exact opposite point on the planet from the impact,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pluto’s internal structure
would have controlled how those shock waves shuddered through the dwarf planet.
Looking at the cracks in the surface ice could give clues to the thickness of
the proposed ocean or the core’s chemical makeup. So Denton and her colleagues ran
computer simulations of an impact to look for clues. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We got the fun answer,” she
says. To explain the lines seen on the dwarf planet, not only would Pluto need
a large ocean, 150 kilometers or more in thickness, but the core must contain
minerals, such as serpentine, that form through interactions between rock and
water. Astrobiologists think that water-rock interactions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-salt-may-stripe-europas-surface&quot;&gt;could provide energy and nutrients for life&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 5/19/15&lt;/em&gt;). The possibility of a somewhat soggy
core could let life get a toehold at the fringes of the solar system, Denton
says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s certainly not exactly
a smoking gun,” she says. “But it’s exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The possibility that Pluto has a habitable ocean raises the odds that other Kuiper Belt objects do too, says planetary scientist James Tuttle Keane of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who is a member of the New Horizons team but was not involved in either study.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This lays out one of the
coolest hypotheses that a future Pluto mission could test,” he says. “If Pluto
can have an ocean and potentially be habitable, it’s very likely that other
bodies in the Kuiper Belt also are ocean worlds and also are potentially
habitable.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/IS098TI3W-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the Cesarean section (CS) &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2689-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;rate has been increasing&lt;/a&gt; with the main reason being a woman’s prior CS history. Trial of labor after Cesarean (TOLAC), with the aim of achieving vaginal birth rather than repeat CS, is considered a safe and reasonable option. However, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14662227&quot;&gt;rate of TOLAC is decreasing&lt;/a&gt;, especially in Japan, and most women who are eligible for TOLAC choose elective repeat Cesarean delivery (ERCD) without receiving detailed information about the merit of TOLAC. Obstetricians who do not offer the option of TOLAC underline for these women that TOLAC is a “dangerous” option even though the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1440-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;risk of uterine rupture&lt;/a&gt; is around 0.5% and ERCD has also a variety of complications, in contrast to successful TOLAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been thinking that the patient’s decision, rather than the doctor’s, is the most important to improve success rate of TOLAC. Therefore, we have performed a prospective study based on women’s decisions after receiving a detailed explanation of the risks and benefits of both TOLAC and ERCD. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-2833-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Our new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showed promising results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our criteria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our TOLAC criteria, which are based on earlier studies, are shown in Table 1.  For pregnant women who met all these TOLAC criteria, we explained the risks and benefits of both TOLAC and ERCD with detailed documents, at 32 weeks of gestation. The documents about TOLAC included the risks of uterine rupture which occurs in around 0.5% of women, which is much higher than that of ERCD, and carries a risk of mortality for the fetus and/or the mother. On the other hand, ERCD has higher risks of bleeding, infection, thrombosis, and complication of subsequent pregnancies. The women in our study could choose their delivery mode after counseling on these risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table 1. Criteria for TOLAC in this study&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;height: 447px;&quot; width=&quot;573&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;1) only one previous Cesarean delivery&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;2) former Cesarean delivery was a low transverse Cesarean&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;3) no obstetric contraindications for vaginal delivery&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;3) singleton pregnancy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;4) vertex presentation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;5) no history of myomectomy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;6) in general, no medical induction of labor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;566&quot;&gt;7) well informed on the risks of TOLAC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We screened 1,086 pregnant women for eligibility and 735 met the above criteria. Of these, 64.1% opted for TOLAC. Earlier studies also showed the same rate, which means that if women receive sufficient education and support, they tend to choose TOLAC as their desirable mode of delivery. Obstetricians should understand this fact and should not underline only the risk of rare complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High success rate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study had a rate of successful TOLAC (vaginal birth) of 91.3%, similar to the vaginal birth rate of women who have no history of Cesarean, with the rate of uterine rupture being 0.6%. There were no infant deaths or long-term sequelae among all 471 TOLAC attempts. Apgar scores of &amp;lt;7 at 5 minutes, which is a marker of fetal asphyxia, did not significantly differ between the two groups. Women with history of vaginal birth in addition to a prior CS had a high chance of successful TOLAC (96.4%), and when labor spontaneously occurred before 40 weeks of gestation, the success rate was favorable (97.6%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have shown that TOLAC can be considered a reasonable means of birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have tried to reveal the reasons for this high success rate and showed that in the successful TOLAC group, 70.5% of women had a previous CS without labor due to non-recurrent indications, including breech presentation, placenta previa, severe preeclampsia, or suspected cephalopelvic disproportion. On the other hand, over 40% of women who chose repeat ERCD had a previous CS that followed unsuccessful labor due to indications such as labor arrest disorders or non-reassuring fetal status (p&amp;lt;0.01). We believe these differences may have positively impacted the TOLAC success rate, partly because unsuitable candidates may have self-excluded from the TOLAC group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factors associated with failed TOLAC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study revealed that factors related to failed TOLAC included ≥40 weeks of gestation and prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM). After 40 weeks of gestation, success rates decreased (from 97.6% to 76.9%). Half of failed TOLAC cases experienced PROM. Until now, there have been limited studies into the impact of PROM on TOLAC. Obstetricians should be encouraged to have ongoing discussions with women about their mode of delivery after the due date or PROM, as these may be indications to change from planned TOLAC to ERCD. Ongoing discussions throughout pregnancy are important for preventing complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have shown that TOLAC can be considered a reasonable means of birth not only for mothers but also for neonates, with over 60% of eligible women choosing TOLAC and over 90% of those achieving successful TOLAC. History of vaginal birth in addition to CS increased odds of successful TOLAC, while PROM or ≥40 weeks of gestation were risk factors for failed TOLAC. Obstetricians have to discuss the planned mode of birth throughout pregnancy in order to prevent complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our results we would recommend that mothers who have elected ERCD choose a date of CS later than 39 weeks of gestation as some studies suggest a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0803267&quot;&gt;risk of increased negative respiratory outcomes&lt;/a&gt; in elective CS before 39 weeks. If spontaneous labor occurs before the planned date of ERCD, these women could be encouraged to attempt TOLAC instead of emergency CS, because when labor spontaneously occurred before 40 weeks of gestation, the success rate of TOLAC was favorable.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-no-evidence-coronavirus-jumped-pangolin-people"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Pangolins can harbor
coronaviruses related to the new coronavirus, a study finds. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists studied
viruses in pangolins (&lt;em&gt;Manis
javanica&lt;/em&gt;)
captured in anti-smuggling activities in southern China. The identified
coronaviruses, however, are different enough from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that
causes COVID-19, to hint that pangolins were not directly responsible for
transmitting the virus to people, which had been suggested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the pangolin viruses does have a structure that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2169-0&quot;&gt;closely resembles the new coronavirus’ spike protein&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the pathogen to get into cells, infectious disease researcher Tommy Tsan-Yuk Lam of the School of Public Health at the University of Hong Kong and colleagues report March 26 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 is still from a bat, the only other known mammal found to be infected with similar coronaviruses. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new coronavirus’ similarity to both a bat virus and a pangolin virus suggests that viruses from the two animals may have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-not-human-made-lab-genetic-analysis-nature&quot;&gt;exchanged genes&lt;/a&gt; at some point before infecting people (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/26/20&lt;/em&gt;). The pangolin viruses, however, lack a feature seen in SARS-CoV-2 that may have helped the virus make the leap to humans — a hint that the virus may have acquired an adaptation in another, not yet identified, animal before spreading around the globe.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pangolins, while perhaps not directly involved in SARS-CoV-2 jumping to humans, should be handled carefully to prevent the viruses they carry from infecting people, the team writes. The animals are the most illegally trafficked mammal, used both as food and in traditional Chinese medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertals-extensive-seafood-menu-rivals-ancient-humans"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Surf’s up, Neandertals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our close evolutionary cousins obtained shellfish, crabs,
fish and other marine munchies along Europe’s Atlantic coast with all the savvy
and gusto of ancient humans who foraged along southern Africa’s shoreline, say
archaeologist João Zilhão of the University of Barcelona and
his colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neandertals consumed a diverse menu of sea and land foods
while occupying Figueira Brava cave, on Portugal’s coast, for extended periods
between around 106,000 and 86,000 years ago, Zilhão’s group says. Excavations there
show for the first time that &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aaz7943&quot;&gt;Neandertals
matched Stone Age &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in
their ability to exploit seafood rich in brain-enhancing fatty acids, the
scientists report in the March 27  &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. This discovery adds to controversial
evidence that Neandertals engaged in various behaviors traditionally thought to
have characterized only &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt;,
such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dating-questions-challenge-whether-neandertals-drew-spanish-cave-art&quot;&gt;creating
cave art&lt;/a&gt; and elaborate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cache-eagle-claws-points-neandertal-jewelry-making&quot;&gt;personal
ornaments&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 10/28/19; SN: 3/20/15&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Extensive seaside activity at Figueira Brava also expands on
preliminary evidence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertals-dove-harvested-clamshells-tools-near-italy-shores&quot;&gt;Neandertal
clamshell collecting&lt;/a&gt; on the beach and in shallow Mediterranean waters (&lt;em&gt;SN: 1/15/20&lt;/em&gt;). Other excavations had suggested
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-seafood-fans&quot;&gt;Neandertals
occasionally gathered shellfish&lt;/a&gt; and hunted or scavenged sea animals
starting around 110,000 years ago (&lt;em&gt;SN:
9/22/08&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But repeated bouts of Neandertal foraging at Figueira Brava
over a roughly 20,000-year span point to coastal activity as extensive as that
of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/waters-edge-ancestors&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; who harvested shellfish&lt;/a&gt;
at South Africa’s Pinnacle Point between 164,000 and 120,000 years ago, Zilhão
says (&lt;em&gt;SN: 7/29/11&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Intensive shellfish collecting requires tracking of the
tides and the seasons, “certainly one of the hallmarks of behavioral
adaptability of early Neandertals [in Europe] and modern humans in South
Africa,” says archaeologist Katerina Douka of the Max Planck Institute for the
Science of Human History in Jena, Germany. She did not participate in the new
study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zilhão regards Neandertals as an ancient &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; variant that developed in Europe and Asia, not a
separate species as they are often portrayed. “The early &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; of Europe, people whom we came to know as Neandertals,
exploited marine resources at least as intensively as, if not more intensively
than, [Stone Age] South Africans living in comparable habitats and
circumstances,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Figueira Brava lies on the 20-kilometer-long coastline of Arrábida,
a mountain range 30 kilometers south of Lisbon. It’s the only place on Europe’s
Atlantic coast where present-day shorelines and ancient, now-underwater
shorelines are short distances apart, Zilhão says. So only here would
Neandertals have caught seafood and brought it back to nearby caves such as
Figueira Brava, rather than immediately eating what they had caught before
making a long trek inland. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Excavations from 2010 to 2013 unearthed a range of seafood remains
from a time when Neandertals, but not &lt;em&gt;H.
sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, inhabited Europe. Chemical analyses of Figueira Brava sediments
and mineral formations provided age estimates for Neandertal activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Menu items included mussels, limpets, eels and even sharks,
which could have been caught in shallow water or when trapped in large rock
pools by ebbing tides. Other foods eaten by Figueira Brava Neandertals included
tortoises, seals, ducks, geese, red deer, horse, ibex (a kind of wild goat),
now-extinct wild cattle called aurochs and pine nuts. Numerous stone tools and
toolmaking debris were also found. Burned pieces of wood in excavated sediment
came from intentionally lit fires, probably used for cooking, warmth or both, the
researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3086426&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/032620_BB_fishing-neandertals_inline_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3086426&quot;&gt;Bones from the spine of a shark (left) and an eel (right) were among the many seafood remains found at a cave on Portugal’s coast once frequented by Neandertals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3086426&quot;&gt;J. Zilhão &lt;em&gt;et al./Science&lt;/em&gt; 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Discoveries at Figueira Brava challenge past assertions that
Neandertals’ seaside visits were rare and unplanned, says evolutionary
ecologist Clive Finlayson of the Gibraltar National Museum, who was not part of
the excavation team. “Neandertals were every bit human,” he adds, echoing Zilhão’s
argument.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But archaeologist Manuel Will of the University of Tübingen
in Germany disagrees. “The new study &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abb3568&quot;&gt;narrows
the gap&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; and
[Neandertals], but does not close it,” he writes in a commentary published in the
same issue of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taking into account nearly 60 coastal sites occupied either
by Neandertals or &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; between
around 300,000 and 40,000 years ago, &lt;em&gt;H.
sapiens&lt;/em&gt; more intensively exploited coastal resources, Will says. For
instance, shell beads, a demanding ornament to make, have mainly been found at &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; sites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But shell beads are not signs of intensive seafood consumption, Zilhão responds. Klasies River, a &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; coastal site in South Africa that’s especially rich in shellfish remains, has not yielded a single shell bead, he says. The key point is that the density and diversity of Neandertals’ seafood at Figueira Brava equals or exceeds that at South African &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Glowing
X-rays around distant galaxies can’t come from dark matter particles, new
research shows. The mysterious glow &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aaw3772&quot;&gt;failed to show up in the dark matter
halo around the Milky Way&lt;/a&gt;, astrophysicists report in the March 27 &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It seems to be the final
nail in the coffin of the dark matter interpretation,” says astroparticle physicist
Ben Safdi of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tantalizing glows were first
detected in 2014 as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/789/1/13&quot;&gt;excess of X-rays with an energy of 3.5 kiloelectron volts&lt;/a&gt;, or keV, coming from faraway galaxy clusters. Some
astronomers argued that the X-rays could come from decaying particles of dark
matter — the ubiquitous, inert material that makes up more than 80 percent of
the universe’s matter. The X-rays’ energy, in particular, suggested that the
light could be coming from hypothetical dark matter particles called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-neutrino-surplus-hints-existence-new-particles&quot;&gt;sterile neutrinos&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 6/1/18&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But searches for a similar
X-ray glows came up empty in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-grows-over-whether-x-rays-are-sign-dark-matter&quot;&gt;dwarf galaxy Draco&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 12/11/15&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-candidate-particles-are-no-show-hitomi-data&quot;&gt;the Perseus galaxy cluster&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 (&lt;em&gt;SN: 8/12/16&lt;/em&gt;). So Safdi and his
colleagues looked closer to home. The Milky Way’s starry spiral disk is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-have-found-edge-milky-way-size&quot;&gt;surrounded by a halo of dark matter&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/23/20&lt;/em&gt;). If the X-rays come from
decaying dark matter, our galaxy’s halo should sparkle with the light.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All images of the sky look
through some portion of the Milky Way’s dark matter halo, even if that’s not
what a telescope is aiming at. So the researchers sifted through every
observation that the European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton space telescope ever
made, about 347 days of total exposure time, in search of X-rays at the right
energy. The team saw none.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The jury is still out on
what is producing the 3.5 keV” signal, Safdi says. “What’s clear, though, is
it’s not dark matter.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Figure-1_Flattening-the-Curve-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closure of schools and offices has wreaked havoc on families. The cancellation of airline flights, public events, social functions, and the disruption of our economy has been exasperating. We have been thrown into an era dominated by uncertainty, anxiety, and fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are these measures truly necessary to mitigate the current COVID-19 pandemic? The answer is yes. With the lack of a preventive vaccine or definitive treatment for COVID-19, the only way to stop spread is by social distancing and “flattening the curve”. This previously unfamiliar expression is now part of the vernacular. Flattening the curve refers to reducing the number of cases to allow doctors, hospitals and government officials to function at their best without being overwhelmed. It is important to recognize that hospitals have only a finite number of rooms, ventilators and healthcare personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The info-graphic below demonstrates why slowing the spread of the infection is nearly as important as stopping it. While shaped differently, the 2 bell-shaped curves below represent the same number of infected patients. The y-axis or peak of the bell indicates the daily number of cases and the x-axis indicates the time since the first case. The dotted line across the center represents the point at which too many cases in a short period of time will overwhelm the healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large number of people becoming severely ill with COVID-19 over a short period of time as shown in the tall, narrow curve, could result in a shortage of hospital beds, equipment or doctors. On the other hand, as shown in the flatter, longer curve, if the same number of patients presented to the hospital at a slower rate, the likelihood of the hospital to have adequate supplies, beds and health care providers would be higher (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11795 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;343&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Figure-1_Flattening-the-Curve-300x166.jpg&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in order to mitigate the impact of this pandemic, we need to keep the number of cases to below the dotted line. By doing so, we let our healthcare system function at its best. This also allows time for scientists and researchers to create drugs, therapies and potentially an efficacious vaccine against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An especially important factor to consider with respect to flattening the curve, is the necessity to keep our healthcare workers–physicians, nurses, and hospital staff–healthy and safe. With an increasing number of cases in the community, the potential for this workforce to get sick is much higher. If healthcare workers become sick, they will need to be excluded from patient care for many weeks. This effect of this is profound, as it will result in less healthcare workers and less qualified individuals available to take care of the sickest COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social distancing may be our only hope to help flatten the curve and slow the spread of disease. Social distancing involves keeping a physical distance between people, at least 6 feet away, to avoid spread of the COVID-19 virus. This decreases the chances of acquisition of the virus and the disease. With the continued acceleration of this pandemic, no measure can be considered too drastic. The horrifying situation in Italy, wherein patients with COVID-19 have inundated the overburdened healthcare system, forcing doctors to make agonizing triage decisions about who should receive lifesaving care, should not be repeated in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School closures for the purpose of social distancing have especially impacted children and young families. Although current data suggests that children do not appear develop severe illness, it is well-documented that children can still spread the virus to their family members and contacts. Prior influenza pandemics have shown that the highest attack rates were seen in school children due to their close contact. Being separated from friends, can be difficult for children and especially teenagers. Social distancing does not mean social isolation. We can continue to interact using different platforms, such as social media and video applications to help them stay connected during this challenging time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an unprecedented time and although social distancing may be thought to be a dramatic measure, in truth, together as a unified society, we can help slow down the spread of COVID-19. By staying home, you are not just protecting yourself but also other people. It’s the responsible thing to do and although challenging, will help us avoid a situation similar to that of Italy wherein war-like triage decisions and death has become a commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;A wolf-sized warrior, kin to
the fierce, feathered &lt;em&gt;Velociraptor&lt;/em&gt;, prowled what is now New Mexico about
68 million years ago. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dineobellator notohesperus&lt;/em&gt; was a dromaeosaur, a group of swift, agile predators
that is distantly related to the much larger &lt;em&gt;Tyrannosaurus rex&lt;/em&gt;. The
discovery of this new species suggests that dromaeosaurs were still &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61480-7&quot;&gt;diversifying, and even becoming better at pursuing
prey&lt;/a&gt;, right up to the end of the Age
of Dinosaurs, researchers say March 26 in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That age came to an abrupt close
at the end of the Cretaceous Period about 66 million years ago, when a mass
extinction event wiped out all nonbird dinosaurs. A gap in the global fossil
record for dromaeosaurs near the end of the Cretaceous had led some scientists
to wonder &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clearer-picture-emerging-dinosaurs-last-days&quot;&gt;whether the group was already in decline&lt;/a&gt; before the extinction, says Steven Jasinski, a
paleontologist at the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg (&lt;em&gt;SN:
4/21/16&lt;/em&gt;). The new find suggests otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;D. notohesperus skeleton&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3086400&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/032520_cg_dino_inline1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3086400&quot;&gt;A skeletal reconstruction of &lt;em&gt;D. notohesperus&lt;/em&gt; shows that the dromaeosaur, one of a group of agile predators, was about the size of a modern wolf. Analyses of over 20 fossil bits revealed that the dinosaur had feathers and was likely stronger than the closely related &lt;em&gt;Velociraptor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3086400&quot;&gt;S. Jasinski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since 2008, Jasinski and his
colleagues have recovered more than 20 fossilized pieces of the new species from
the Bisti/De-Na-Zin Wilderness, a rapidly eroding region of barren badlands in
northwestern New Mexico. Analyses of muscle attachment sites on the fossilized
forelimbs suggest the dinosaur was unusually strong for a dromaeosaur, with a
very tight grip in its hands and feet. That grip, Jasinski says, was likely
stronger than that of its
famous kinfolk, &lt;em&gt;Velociraptor&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Utahraptor&lt;/em&gt;, giving the new
species extra weaponry in its pursuit of prey. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like many other dromaeosaurs,
&lt;em&gt;D. notohesperus&lt;/em&gt; had feathers, evidenced by the presence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bumpy-bones-fossil-hints-dinosaur-had-feathery-forearms&quot;&gt;quill nobs&lt;/a&gt; —
bumps indicating where the feathers were attached — on its limbs (&lt;em&gt;SN:
9/19/07&lt;/em&gt;). But, like &lt;em&gt;Velociraptor&lt;/em&gt;, it probably used the feathers for purposes
other than flight, Jasinski says, such as sexual selection, camouflage or added
agility while on the hunt. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is currently in an unprecedented state of upheaval and uncertainty. As countries fight to minimise the spread of COVID-19, everyone is adjusting to the “new normal”, remaining at home and practising social distancing. And the same is true of the psychologists whose work we report on every day at &lt;em&gt;Research Digest&lt;/em&gt;: labs have been shut and experiments have suddenly been put on hold in the wake of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many psychologists have also begun launching new research to understand how the present crisis is affecting us, and to inform our response to it. So this week, I’ve been talking to some of these researchers to find out more about their work.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39388&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring our mental health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that the new routines that we are now following are going to be necessary for quite some time. A new study led by social epidemiologist Daisy Fancourt is asking how people are responding to these changes in lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know that our mental health can be affected by isolation, says Fancourt, and there’s never been a situation where so many people have been required to remain physically separated from others. “We’ve not really had something like this in living history,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, the team is examining the trajectories of people’s mental health during the pandemic — and investigating what kinds of activities can help protect against the negative effects of isolation. Any UK resident over 18 can &lt;a href=&quot;https://redcap.idhs.ucl.ac.uk/surveys/?s=TTXKND8JMK&quot;&gt;sign-up online&lt;/a&gt; and fill in an initial, 10 minute survey. Then, once a week, they will automatically get sent a follow-up questionnaire asking about their experiences of COVID-19, how they’ve been spending their time, and their physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By tracking a large number of participants over time, the team hopes to figure out what people can do at home to protect their mental health. They will release the findings regularly to the public and to the government and health authorities, beginning from next week. And they’re in it for the long haul, says Fancourt. “As long as this pandemic is going on, and we’re having these isolation measures, we want to make sure that there is a way that we’re tracking the experiences of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fancourt emphasises that it is crucial that people stay home — doing so will save lives. And there are activities known to be good for our mental health that we can already be doing, she adds: practising music and arts, for instance, or volunteering and providing support for others in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy Orben from the University of Cambridge is part of another team planning a large, year-long study tracking the responses of adolescents and adults during the pandemic. The researchers, who are currently in discussion with funders, plan on tracking participants’ mood and mental health through the use of an app, which will send questions to their phones on a regular basis. Importantly, this app will also record behavioural data: what other apps people are using, for instance, and how long they are spending on their phones, as well as their movement and sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in Fancourt’s study, the researchers hope the work will untangle how people’s activities relate to their mental health. They also plan on looking at how any events and announcements related to the pandemic affect participants’ responses. Orben says the team is keen to rapidly share data with the research community so that it can be analysed as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Orben, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/28/episode-19-should-we-worry-about-screen-time/&quot;&gt;whose research focuses on the psychological effects of media use&lt;/a&gt;, one of the key questions will be how technology is being utilised in a time where face-to-face interaction is extremely limited. “I think it will allow us to move away from just thinking about time spent online and on screens to having more nuanced conversations about … what activities on screens are people actually engaging in,” she says. “Which ones of those are beneficial and help mitigate the effects of social isolation, and which ones might actually exacerbate stress?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring messaging and behaviour &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some researchers have already conducted preliminary research and published the results — as preprints, at least. Many of these studies have attempted to examine the value of different forms of public health messaging, or determine how people are behaving during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/9yqs8&quot;&gt;recent preprint&lt;/a&gt; which surveyed more than 1,000 Americans across two days in March. The team, led by Jim Everett at the University of Kent and Molly Crocket at Yale University, looked at how moral messages could promote public health behaviours. Participants read a Facebook post urging people to stay at home, which was either accompanied by a “deontological” argument, telling people it was their duty to protect their community; a “utilitarian” argument, asking people to think of the negative consequences of not making these sacrifices now; an appeal to virtue, reminding people that staying home is what a good person would do; or no moral argument. They then indicated how likely they would be to adopt public health-related behaviours like washing their hands after getting home, or avoiding public gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were more likely to indicate they would share the deontological message — the one that appealed to their sense of duty — than a post with no moral argument or a virtue-based one.  And there was some evidence that the deontological argument might increase people’s intentions to engage in health-related behaviours: participants reported a stronger intention to wash their hands after reading this message compared to the virtue-based one, for instance, although this effect did not reach statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that messages focused on citizens’ duties and responsibilities to others may be particularly useful. But the work is preliminary and there are important caveats: it only looks at people’s &lt;em&gt;intentions&lt;/em&gt; rather than actual behaviour, and the effects are small and are not always significant. “What we’re very much &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; suggesting is that framing these judgments in more ‘deontological’ ways is unequivocally going to have huge impacts on behaviour,” acknowledges Everett. But still, the findings are consistent with past work, he says, adding that even interventions that produce small changes could, together, have an impact in the pandemic. The team is now working with other groups to see whether similar effects are found outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have also looked at how differences in personalities influence how likely we are to accept constraints to our quality of life (like social isolation) in order to protect ourselves or others from the virus. Ingo Zettler and colleagues from the University of Copenhagen &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/pkm2a/&quot;&gt;have posted a preprint&lt;/a&gt; based on a survey of 799 Danish citizens who completed personality questionnaires. Participants who scored higher on the so-called “Dark Factor” — which relates to people’s willingness to pursue their own interests at the expense of others — were less likely to accept these constraints. In contrast, those who scored higher on the trait of emotionality, who tend to be more anxious and empathetic, were more likely to follow them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other rapid studies have included research into &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/dz428&quot;&gt;Americans’ perceptions of risk and behaviours&lt;/a&gt; early on in the pandemic, how &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/y2cg5/&quot;&gt;empathy relates to social distancing&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/epcyb/&quot;&gt;“optimism bias”&lt;/a&gt; when people consider the chance they will contract or pass on the virus. Again, it’s important to point out that most of this research consists of preprints which have not yet been peer-reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proceeding quickly… &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These studies represent just a snapshot of the work psychologists are conducting in the midst of the current crisis. J Nathan Matias from Cornell University and Alex Leavitt from Facebook Research have set up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/natematias/covid-19-social-science-research&quot;&gt;COVID-19 Social Science Research Tracker&lt;/a&gt;, in which researchers can record details of projects they are working on. As of 26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; March, more than 100 projects are listed, on everything from the spread of conspiracy theories to the effects of remote teaching on education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the list is to help researchers who are planning studies find ways of working together and determine where they should be channelling their efforts, says Matias. The tracker will also ensure people are aware of new results as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other networks are also getting involved in the response. The Psychological Science Accelerator, a network of labs which collaborate on large-scale studies, recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://psysciacc.org/2020/03/21/join-the-psas-rapid-response-covid-19-project/&quot;&gt;put out a call for “rapid and impactful studies”&lt;/a&gt; to understand the psychological side of the pandemic. The group has decided to go ahead with three of the proposals, including a study that will examine the behavioural benefits of framing public health information in terms of gains (e.g. lives saved) rather than losses (e.g. deaths). Several journals have also joined &lt;a href=&quot;http://neurochambers.blogspot.com/2020/03/calling-all-scientists-rapid-evaluation.html&quot;&gt;an initiative calling for submissions of Registered Reports&lt;/a&gt; on research related to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;strong&gt; but with caution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While researchers conduct rapid research and stick preprints online, there’s another key effort that scientists can get involved in, says Matias: peer-review. “As we move quickly to organise the production of new knowledge, we absolutely need people who can take the time to look through those preprints … and get us to the point of verified knowledge in time for it to be useful,” he says. Orben echoes these concerns: “Just because things are urgent doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be scrutinised.” That scrutiny itself will need to become more instantaneous, she adds. Many journals, including the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lauragesmith/status/1240712219731558402/photo/1&quot;&gt;British Journal of Social Psychology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BPSOfficial/status/1242892821629153280?s=20&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;British Journal of Health Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are already promising expedited peer review of papers related to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some psychologists have stressed that it’s also important this rapid response is informed by past work, whether that consists of studies into outbreaks specifically, or just well-grounded psychological science more generally. “The first rule of preventing harm is learning from what’s been done before,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vaughanbell/status/1241991708436504577?s=20&quot;&gt;tweeted Vaughan Bell recently&lt;/a&gt;. “If it’s urgent, the urgency is to do it right”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although many researchers are able to conduct psychological research in the midst of a pandemic, Matias emphasises that not everyone is in a position to do so.  “A lot of people have been impacted themselves in ways that make it difficult to continue research. And that’s okay,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who do have the time or means to do so, however, it can be rewarding. “It’s easy to feel quite helpless at the moment,” says Everett. “I’m really glad I’m doing it – it makes me feel like I am perhaps able to contribute in some small part”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psychologist&lt;em&gt; also has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-33/april-2020/coronavirus-psychological-perspectives&quot;&gt;growing collection of resources&lt;/a&gt; relating to COVID-19&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew Warren (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@MattbWarren&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) is Editor of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BPS Research Digest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Around 2.6 million babies a year are stillborn. Although it’s always devastating to lose a baby,  parents grieving for a stillborn child are more likely to experience depression and post-traumatic stress than those when the child had been born alive.  There is considerable stigma, social shame and marginalization associated with parental grief for a stillborn child with the result that it has attracted little attention by health care providers, resulting in inadequate support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents grieving for a stillborn child are more likely to experience depression and post-traumatic stress than those when the child had been born alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farrales et al. recently ran a qualitative participatory research study to explore the experiences of bereaved parents when interacting with health care providers during and after the stillbirth of their child.Results showed was that both mothers and fathers needed acknowledgement from their health care provider that the baby was a irreplaceable individual in its own right, recognized that they were parents that were grieving, recognized how traumatic stillbirth is and recognition that the parents will continue to feel bereaved for a time and that they needed support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cocites.com/&quot;&gt;CoCites&lt;/a&gt; was developed by Janssens et al. at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html&quot;&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike many other tools for searching though the scientific literature, CoCites uses citations rather than keywords. It has been designed to be more efficient than the traditional keyword-based methods and works on the assumption that the user knows at least one highly relevant article within their chosen research area, pulling out all articles that have previously been cited together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article describes the results of using CoCites to reproduce the literature searches of a number of published systematic reviews and meta-analyses; these showed that CoCites retrieved a median of 75% of the articles that were included in the original reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who play sports are often faced  with a dilemma when they are injured. Should they continue playing or stop. Until now, the implications of playing sport when injured on both joint health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has not been investigated. With this in mind, Bullock et al. performed research on the relationship between playing while injured, HRQoL, osteoarthritis and persistent joint pain, comparing findings across both elite and recreational cricket players. The study involved asking participates to fill in a questionnaire describing their history &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-11777&quot; height=&quot;255&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/cricket-724617_1920-300x255.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;of playing sport while injured and details on any diagnosed osteoarthritis and/or persistent joint pain. It was found that, indeed, cricketers who played injured had their HRQoL adversely affected and were at increased risk of osteoarthritis and joint pain. The authors conclude that the long-term impact of playing while injured should be considered when advising athletes on their ability to compete following an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-020-1946-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;How many words are Australian children hearing in their first year of life?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is evidence to suggest that parents from more socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds interact verbally with their children less than parents from more advantaged background, resulting in what has been coined “the 30 million-word gap”. Brushe et al. decided to explore this further, investigating the number of worlds children hear in their first year of life and whether this is influenced by the level of education attained by the mother. The five year study involved grouping the mothers into high or low education groups and then collecting data from audio-recordings when the children were 6 months old and again when they were a year old.  The number of words spoken by the mothers when they were talking to their children were counted using the Language Environment Analysis software. Results showed that there was a large variation of words spoken by the mother within each education group, but no meaningful differences between the different educational groups. This suggests that a word gap associated with the level of education attained by the mother is not apparent in the first year of a child’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;The coronavirus pandemic circling the
globe is caused by a natural virus, not one made in a lab, a new study says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virus’s genetic makeup reveals that
SARS-CoV-2 isn’t a mishmash of known viruses, as might be expected if it were
human-made. And it has unusual features that have only recently been identified
in scaly anteaters called pangolins, evidence that the virus came from nature,
Kristian Andersen and his colleagues report March 17 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Andersen, an infectious disease
researcher at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., first heard
about the coronavirus causing an outbreak in China, he wondered where the virus
came from. Initially, researchers thought the virus was being spread by
repeated infections jumping from animals in a seafood market in Wuhan, China,
into humans and then being passed person to person. Analysis from other
researchers has since suggested that the virus probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-questions-covid19-symptoms-deaths-spread&quot;&gt;jumped
only once from an animal into a person&lt;/a&gt; and has been spread human to human
since about mid-November (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/4/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But shortly after the virus’s genetic
makeup was revealed in early January, rumors began bubbling up that maybe the
virus was engineered in a lab and either intentionally or accidentally
released. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;An unfortunate coincidence fueled
conspiracy theorists, says Robert Garry, a virologist at Tulane University in
New Orleans. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is “in very close proximity to”
the seafood market, and has conducted research on viruses, including
coronaviruses, found in bats that have potential to cause disease in people. “That
led people to think that, oh, it escaped and went down the sewers, or somebody
walked out of their lab and went over to the market or something,” Garry says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Accidental releases of viruses,
including SARS, have happened from other labs in the past. So “this is not
something you can just dismiss out of hand,” Andersen says. “That would be
foolish.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Looking for clues&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Andersen assembled a team of
evolutionary biologists and virologists, including Garry, from several
countries to analyze the virus for clues that it could have been human-made, or
grown in and accidentally released from a lab.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We said, ‘Let’s take this theory — of
which there are multiple different versions — that the virus has a non-natural
origin … as a serious potential hypothesis,’ ” Andersen says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meeting via Slack and other virtual
portals, the researchers analyzed the virus’s genetic makeup, or RNA sequence,
for clues about its origin. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was clear “almost overnight” that the
virus wasn’t human-made, Andersen says. Anyone hoping to create a virus would
need to work with already known viruses and engineer them to have desired
properties. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the SARS-CoV-2 virus has components
that differ from those of previously known viruses, so they had to come from an
unknown virus or viruses in nature. “Genetic data irrefutably show that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9&quot;&gt;SARS-CoV-2 is not
derived&lt;/a&gt; from any previously used virus backbone,” Andersen and colleagues write
in the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is not a virus somebody would have conceived
of and cobbled together. It has too many distinct features, some of which are
counterintuitive,” Garry says. “You wouldn’t do this if you were trying to make
a more deadly virus.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class=&quot;wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;See all our coverage of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other scientists agree. “We see absolutely no
evidence that the virus has been engineered or purposely released,” says Emma
Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of Basel in Switzerland.
She was not part of Andersen’s group, but is a member of a team of scientists
with &lt;a href=&quot;https://nextstrain.org/&quot;&gt;Nextstrain.org&lt;/a&gt; that is tracking
small genetic changes in the coronavirus to learn more about how it is
spreading around the world. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That finding debunks a widely disputed analysis,
posted at bioRxiv.org before peer review, that claimed to find bits of HIV in
the coronavirus, Hodcroft says. Other scientists quickly pointed out flaws in
the study and the authors retracted the report, but not before it fueled the
notion that the virus was engineered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some stretches of the virus’s genetic material are
similar to HIV, but that’s something that stems from those viruses sharing a
common ancestor during evolution, Hodcroft says. “Essentially their claim was
the same as me taking a copy of the&lt;em&gt; Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;
and saying, ‘Oh, this has the word &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;
in it,’ and then opening another book, seeing the word &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; in it and saying, ‘Oh my gosh, it’s the same word, there must
be parts of the &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; in this other
book,” she says. “It was a really misleading claim and really bad science.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Finding peculiar features&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Andersen’s group next set out to determine whether
the virus could have been accidentally released from a lab. That’s a real
possibility because researchers in many places are working with coronaviruses
that have potential to infect humans, he says. “Stuff comes out of the lab
sometimes, almost always accidentally,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A couple of unexpected features of the virus
caught the researchers’ eyes, Andersen says. In particular, the gene encoding
the coronavirus’s spike protein has 12 extra RNA building blocks, or
nucleotides, stuck in it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This spike protein protrudes from the virus’
surface and allows the virus to latch onto and enter human cells. That
insertion of RNA building blocks adds four amino acids to the spike protein,
and creates a site in the protein for an enzyme called furin to cut. Furin is
made in human cells, and cleaves proteins only at spots where a particular
combination of amino acids is found, like the one created by the insertion. SARS
and other SARS-like viruses don’t have those cutting sites.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Finding the furin cutting site was a
surprise: “That was an aha moment and an uh-oh moment,” Garry says. When bird
influenza viruses acquire the ability to be cut by furin, the viruses often
become more easily transmissible. The insertion also created places where sugar
molecules could be fastened to the spike protein, creating a shield to protect the
virus from the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 virus’ spike protein also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-repurposed-treatments-drugs&quot;&gt;binds
more tightly&lt;/a&gt; to a protein on human cells called ACE2 than SARS does (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/10/20&lt;/em&gt;). Tighter binding may allow SARS-CoV-2
to more easily infect cells. Together, those features may account for why
COVID-19 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms&quot;&gt;so
contagious&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/13/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s very peculiar, these two
features,” Andersen says. “How do we explain how this came about?  I’ve got to be honest. I was skeptical [that
it was natural]. This could have happened in tissue culture” in a lab, where
viruses may acquire mutations as they replicate many times in lab dishes. In
nature, viruses carrying some of those mutations might be weeded out by natural
selection but might persist in lab dishes where even feeble viruses don’t have
to fight hard for survival. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Clinching the case for nature&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But then the researchers compared SARS-CoV-2 with other
coronaviruses recently found in nature, including in bats and pangolins. “It
looks like SARS-CoV-2 could be a mix of bat and pangolin viruses,” Garry says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Viruses, especially RNA viruses such as
coronaviruses, often swap genes in nature. Finding genes related to the
pangolin viruses was especially reassuring because those viruses’ genetic
makeup wasn’t known until after SARS-CoV-2’s discovery, making it unlikely
anyone was working with them in a lab, he says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;pangolin&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3086389&quot; src=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/031920_ts_covid-conspiracies_inline_680.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption wp-caption-3086389&quot;&gt;Coronaviruses that infect pangolins gave researchers important clues that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is natural.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit wp-credit-3086389&quot;&gt;2630ben/iStock/Getty Images Plus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In particular, pangolins also have the amino acids
that cause the tight binding of the spike protein to ACE2, the team found. “So
clearly, this is something that can happen in nature,” Andersen says. “I
thought that was very important little clue. It shows there’s no mystery about
its tighter binding to the human [protein] because pangolins do it, too.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sugar-attachment sites were another clue that
the virus is natural, Andersen says. The sugars create a “mucin shield” that
protects the virus from an immune system attack. But lab tissue culture dishes
don’t have immune systems, making it unlikely that such an adaptation would
arise from growing the virus in a lab. “That sort of explained away the tissue-culture
hypothesis,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat and pangolin viruses is some of the best evidence that the virus is natural, Hodcroft says. “This was just another animal spillover into humans,” she says. “It’s really the most simple explanation for what we see.” Researchers still aren’t sure exactly which animal was the source.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Andersen says the analysis probably won’t lay conspiracy theories to rest. Still, he thinks the analysis was worth doing. “I was myself skeptical at the beginning and I kept flipping back and forth,” Andersen says, but he’s now convinced. “All the data show it’s natural.” &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll probably be familiar with the idea of behavioural “nudges” — interventions that encourage people to make better choices, without changing the actual options available. As a concept, nudging has become hugely popular, with at least 200 “nudge units” in governments and institutions around the world. We’ve certainly reported on a few studies finding that simple nudges &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/03/giving-people-simple-moral-nudges-encourages-them-to-donate-much-more-to-charity/&quot;&gt;encourage people to give more to charity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/19/simply-changing-the-order-of-fast-food-menus-nudges-customers-towards-healthier-soft-drink-choices/&quot;&gt;help people to make healthier soft drink choices from fast food menus&lt;/a&gt;, for example. You might be forgiven for thinking, then, that there are no limits to what nudging can do….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0795-z&quot;&gt;set of studies&lt;/a&gt; designed to “nudge” commuters’ behaviour, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour &lt;/em&gt;and involving a total of almost 69,000 people, has found that there definitely are limits. “The failure of these well-powered experiments … highlights both the difficulty of changing commuter behaviour and the importance of publishing null results to build cumulative knowledge about how to encourage sustainable travel,” write Ariella S. Kristal and Ashley V. Whillans, of Harvard Business School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39383&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants were employees of a major European airport. About half had reported driving by themselves to and from work. But almost 60% of this group said they would consider carpooling, and 41% said that finding a “matched” person with a similar commute to carpool with was a key reason why they weren’t already doing it. Many employees also reported that if they were given discounts on public transport, they’d be more likely to use it. The airport did already have a carpool service, and was also well connected to subway, rail and bus infrastructure. It seemed, then, like the ideal place to nudge people towards commuter behaviours that would benefit their own health and pocket, as well as, of course, the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first experiment, Kristal and Whillans tested a letter and email campaign designed to encourage employees to sign up for carpooling by highlighting the benefits and providing testimonials from carpoolers. Though this intervention did increase registrants, this increase was tiny, and, statistically, it made absolutely no difference to the numbers who actually used the service. (For this study, the researchers sent out 15,000 letters. Only 33 employees registered for the service as a result. One month later, only three who’d received the initial letter were active carpoolers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second study, they gave employees details of good personal carpooling matches, and reminded them that carpooling would save them money. (Remember, a lack of knowledge about someone suitable to carpool with was reported in initial surveys as a key barrier to doing it.) But  again, this intervention did not increase carpooling behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, they tried giving a different group of more than 7,000 employees a free one-week bus trial. But this intervention failed to subsequently increase registration for discounted bus passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fourth experiment, the pair provided just over 1,000 employees with comprehensive personalised travel plans. These plans included information about carpooling matches, bus and train routes and times, transit pass discounts and bike routes. These employees were also offered a one-on-one session with the airport commuter team to talk this through. Only 21 people signed up for these sessions. And, overall, the intervention made no difference whatsoever to the participants’ commuter behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one significant limitation to the study that the researchers themselves point out: this particular airport offers employees a free parking space. Perhaps these attempted nudges would have had more impact on people who have to pay for their parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they do draw a few cautionary conclusions from their findings. One: the work “suggests that people do not always reveal their true intentions or barriers to sustainable commuting.” Though many had initially said that they &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; carpool or use public transport if they had discounted travel, this isn’t what transpired. Further work will be needed to investigate exactly why this is (maybe they don’t really want to talk to co-workers during the commute, for example). But it does seem that nudges aren’t enough to change commuter behaviours. Heavier-handed policies, such as congestion charges and parking bans, may be necessary to bring about shifts in this type of behaviour, the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, though, they think the findings also suggest that nudges might not be that effective at changing habitual behaviours, in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An accompanying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0832-y&quot;&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; in the journal welcomes the publication of this paper. Though the majority of studies reporting nudge interventions have found them to be successful, given the known problem of bias towards publishing positive results, “it’s possible that many more unsuccessful interventions exist but have never been reported,” the editorial observes. And clearly, this is an example of a case where null results have policy implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the editorial notes, “the study points to the limits of nudges and reminds us that they are not a panacea. While they can be a low-cost and simple way to shift many behaviours, it’s important to remember that not all behaviours are equally easy to shift.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our relationship with our parents can have a big impact on our life trajectory. Research has found that those of us &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/04/lying-to-your-kids-could-make-them-more-dishonest-and-less-well-adjusted-as-adults/&quot;&gt;lied to by&lt;/a&gt; caregivers often end up less well-adjusted, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/11/is-your-work-ethic-rooted-in-the-quality-of-the-relationship-you-had-with-your-parents/&quot;&gt;hard workers&lt;/a&gt; are more likely to produce children with good work ethics, that cognitive skills can be improved by having &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/06/04/largest-observational-study-of-its-kind-finds-talkative-parents-have-kids-with-better-cognitive-skills-but-its-not-clear-why/&quot;&gt;talkative parents&lt;/a&gt;, and that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/12/15/positive-parenting-gets-under-the-skin-showing-up-years-later-in-the-cortisol-response/&quot;&gt;positive parenting&lt;/a&gt; can impact cortisol levels even years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But though we might pay less attention to it, how parents relate to one another is also important for children’s long-term development. A new study, published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13524-019-00851-w&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demography&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;has taken a look at affection within parental relationships, finding that loving spousal relationships can have a positive long-term impact on children’s life paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39379&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The researchers focused on Nepal, which they say provides an interesting backdrop for an investigation into marriage. Marriage has changed significantly in the country over the last few years: marrying for love (as opposed to arranged marriage) is now more common than it used to be, and rates of divorce and premarital cohabitation are also increasing in the country, though remain rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data was gathered from a longitudinal study, where marital relationship quality and the educational and personal progress of children were tracked for twelve years. The first set of data was collected from 151 neighborhoods in the Western Chitwan Valley in 1996. The quality of relationships among married participants was measured by asking partners separately how much they loved their husband or wife on a three-point scale, and participants were also asked whether their spouse had ever beaten them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To look at how parents’ relationships influenced children’s own marriage behaviour, the researchers then tracked the age at which children married over the next 10 years. In 2008, they also re-interviewed participants, asking mothers whether or not their children had dropped out of school, and if so at what age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggested that marriage quality was in fact associated with children’s educational prospects. Children with parents who reported greater love for each other were less likely to drop out of school, whilst those whose parents reported less love were more likely to stop education. Children with parents who reported spousal violence were also more likely to drop out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educational outcomes were also related to both class and ethnicity: children from ethnic groups with higher social status, from wealthier households, or whose parents had higher educational backgrounds were more likely to remain in education. The relationship between marriage quality and children’s life outcomes was still significant after controlling for these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children’s own marriage timing was also linked to levels of their parents’ spousal love: the more positive the parental relationship, the later children got married. It’s important to note that in the context of the study, this was considered to be a good thing — in Nepal, later marriage can imply a better match, and that children feel less need to leave the family home at any cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as expected, the quality of parents’ marriages had a significant impact on their children, both in terms of educational attainment and on their own relationships later in life. However, the findings may not bear out in the rest of the world, where other cultural factors may come into play. There may also have been nuances that were missed in the measures. For instance, participants were asked only about instances of &lt;em&gt;extreme&lt;/em&gt; conflict between spouses; conflicts or abuse may have occurred that were more subtle or less extreme than domestic violence, but that had an impact on children nonetheless. Similarly, educational attainment was measured only by when children dropped out of school, failing to take into consideration what students did after leaving school or the grades they achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limitations aside, the results do pose an interesting question about how spousal relationships impact children. It’s understandable that parents spend much of their time focusing on their interactions with their children — but looking at the way they feel about their partner may be just as useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13524-019-00851-w&quot;&gt;Parents’ Marital Quality and Children’s Transition to Adulthood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a musician is playing a piece, and the audience is enjoying it, they can develop physical synchronies. Both might tap their feet, sway their bodies, or clap their hands. “Through music, the producer and the perceiver connect emotionally and behaviourally,” note the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920301427?dgcid=rss_sd_all&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt;. And now this team, led by Yingying Hou at East China Normal University, has uncovered a connection right down at the neural level. The team has observed “inter-brain coherence” (IBC) — a synchronisation in brain activity — between a musician and the audience. What’s more, the strength of this coherence could be used to predict how much the audience enjoyed a piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39376&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The team used a technique called near-infrared spectroscopy to monitor the brain activity of a professional violinist while he was videoed playing a series of 12 brief, classical pieces. They then used the same technique (which involves shining beams of light through the skull, to monitor changes in blood flow) on 16 women while they watched the video, and listened to all of these pieces. (Because gender differences in inter-brain synchronisation have previously been observed, only women were recruited as listeners.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The violinist had been instructed to look directly at the camera and maintain a neutral expression while he played the pieces, which each lasted about 100 seconds. If he was enjoying one piece more than another, the team hoped this would not be obvious to the viewers. They were told to gaze at the violinist’s face while they listened. After each piece, they rated how much they liked it on a seven-point scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data revealed inter-brain coherence between each of the listeners and the musician, for all of the violin pieces. That is, there were similar patterns of heightened activity in certain key regions of the brain while the violinist played and the other participants listened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key regions included the left temporal cortex (which is thought to focus on processing the rhythm of sound information), the right inferior frontal cortex and the postcentral cortices. These two latter regions have been highlighted as important hubs of a hypothesised mirror system that allows a sender and receiver to share brain representations. “In the present study, the frontoparietal mirror neuron system allows audiences to experience or comprehend the mind of the performer as if they were to ‘walk in another’s shoes’,” the researchers believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also produced an average IBC score for each piece of music, and compared these with the listeners’ averaged liking scores for each piece. They found clear correlations. The more popular pieces were marked by stronger inter-brain coherence in the left temporal cortex between the audience as a whole and the performer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also reported that the link between level of coherence and popularity only developed during the second half of each piece. This could be because there are two stages to music appreciation, they suggest. The first stage involves recognising rhythms, and identifying the potential musical structure of a piece. During the next stage, the listener develops aesthetic judgements and experiences emotional resonance, and generates stronger predictions about the sounds that ‘should’ follow. “If the expectation matches the incoming information, the musical performance will be experienced as pleasant,” the team thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More work will be needed to explain why the coherence-liking effect only emerged at a group level, and to explore whether the results obtained here will also apply to other types of musical instrument, and other genres. The team also note that the near-infrared technique only allowed them to look at blood flow in the cortex, not other deeper areas that might be involved in the response to music production and perception, too, such as limbic structures. Also, by design, this study only involved women. Whether men will respond in the same way is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s fascinating research. “This study expands our understanding of music appreciation,” the researchers write, adding: “The results can potentially be applied to the development of brain indices for predicting public attitudes towards various musical performances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920301427?dgcid=rss_sd_all&quot;&gt;The averaged inter-brain coherence between the audience and a violinist predicts the popularity of violin performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020&quot;&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; was announced on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization, marking a turning point for the public health systems serving the health of constituent populations across the globe. This declaration moment is important for narrative on COVID-19 because it is the point at which it is accepted that the virus is not only travelling to different countries, but is now circulating in those countries. Governments are now required to take action to moderate the impact of the infection, reducing harm for the polity until the virus – through the mutation of its biological properties, human immunity, vaccines or some combination of these – takes its place, we hope, among the many other microbes with which human life has found co-existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO declaration is also an important moment for the COVID-19 story because it reveals how data about notifications of diagnosed infection and deaths are used to make decisions and therefore reveals how, in the circumstances of a pandemic, it is keenly apparent that numerical and narrative futures constitute each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandemics are narrated into meaningful existence and COVID-19 is no exception. In Australia, for instance, news stories on the novel coronavirus have escalated since January 2020 to become headlined on many broadcast and digital news platforms. This pattern of media interest conforms to what has been seen in previous outbreaks. Swine flu in 2009 was a significant media event that did not go unremarked in the interviews and focus groups I and colleagues conducted with members of the general population variously impacted by the pandemic threat. Ebola, too, was a prominent news story in 2014 as was Zika in the run up to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro  in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 resembles these other outbreaks and pandemics, but the news stories about it seem to have a distinctively numerical quality. The number of known infections in a particular place over a period of time gives an index of the transmissibility of an infection. Mortality rates – a measure of the proportion of people that die with an infection – are also woven into pandemic stories, in general. But COVID-19’s numbers seem to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; its story. News feeds continually update the counts of diagnoses and deaths, and have numerically tracked the contagion from a supposed source in China to other countries, notably South Korea, Iran and Italy, and then to most other parts of the world. This pandemic by numbers approach charts the particular transmissibility and severity of this virus, but also lends itself to our increasingly complex small-screen media diet, where numbers and graphs alongside images and videos more easily convey the COVID-19 story than do long form narrative texts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 also comes into a context where public health systems have increasingly turned to mathematical models to make decisions about how to manage various infections, notably HIV and influenza. Models are used to decide how to apply resources and strategies to best effect. For example, modelling has shown how HIV can be prevented by HIV treatments, because they reduce the likelihood of the transmission of the virus. For influenza, models are used to calculate what proportion of the population needs to be vaccinated to protect the whole population from an emerging infection. These models can be adjusted to fit what is known about the biosocial properties of a particular infection, the efficacy of treatments and vaccines, and cost. In the case of COVID-19, for example, models may be indicating that containment will reduce the speed and scope of transmission and therefore reduce mortality, the burden on the health system, and ultimately the cost for governments. COVID-19 may be a fully-fledged algorithmic pandemic in the sense that its storyline is transparently about its numbers and because it is managed in terms of the models that combine numerical indices of transmission, mortality, burden, and cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathematical models and narratives also have a point of contact in relation to futures and pasts: they both offer means of trying to shape what might happen through action in the present guided by understandings of what has happened. Decision-makers want to know how to act now to reduce the future impact of a pandemic and models support these decisions by analysing pre-existing data about transmission, mortality, the benefits and costs of treatments, vaccines and containment, for example. Modelling, then, looks to what the future might be by assessing a pandemic’s past numbers. This is strictly true even during the course of a particular pandemic. Narratives on pandemic futures also recall the past, for example, through reference to the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, swine flu in 2009, and other outbreaks, and on that basis orient the narrator and their interlocutors to possible futures. Public policy statements about containment requirements and news media vision of empty supermarket shelves both reflect action in the present that is predicated on pasts and aims to shape futures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all its life threatening, anxiety-making potential, though, the numerical narrative on COVID-19 is surprisingly impersonal. Stories of the many lives affected by the pandemic and the full tenor of its corporeal horrors are crowded out by governmental advice and updating of the numbers. One reason for this separation of pandemic knowing and lived experience is their incommensurability. Pandemics are constituted in the sheer scale and spread of their numbers, so much so that no one person can experience a pandemic without recourse to some signification of this calculated, collective plight. Infections, in contrast, are visceral and personal, including for those who devote themselves to providing care. Moreover, narrative arguably meets its limits in the experience of an infection because, like traumatic experience, living through a debilitating one is not an easy story to tell. Some accounts of how people experienced the 1918-1919 pandemic remark on the lack of affect, giving the impression that emotion was bracketed aside as irresponsible, impossible or even a luxury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerical narrative, then, may not only be one of the ways we can know a pandemic is happening; it may provide the means of living with emerging threat. As they say, time – and numbers – will tell how things turn out for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: “people walking on train station” by Liliya Lisa.

 Following five years of criticism, a group of researchers based at Stanford and elsewhere have retracted a 2006 paper in Nature for “image anomalies.”  The notice for “Lysyl oxidase is essential for hypoxia-induced metastasis” reads: We, the authors, are retracting this Article owing to issues that have come to our attention regarding figure assembly and … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2020/03/23/nature-paper-on-cancer-retracted-after-years-of-scrutiny/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Nature paper on cancer retracted after years of scrutiny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Diets and superfoods are all the rage. From acai berries to the Zone diet, many a dietary trend has come along promising a range of benefits, such as weight loss, heart health, and improved cognition. But the science behind these claims is often sketchy at best. One dietary regime that has stood the test of time – and importantly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/5-studies-on-the-mediterranean-diet&quot;&gt;scientific scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; – is the Mediterranean diet. Earlier this year, U.S. News and World Report named the Mediterranean diet as &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://health.usnews.com/wellness/food/articles/how-us-news-ranks-best-diets&quot;&gt;the best diet of 2020&lt;/a&gt; for the third year in a row. The diets were scored by a panel of nationally recognized experts in diet and nutrition. In second place was another consistent high performer in the rankings, the DASH diet (DASH stands for dietary approaches to stop hypertension) which focuses on lowering blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are on a DASH diet or the Mediterranean diet you are probably eating fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods, as well as whole-grain foods, fish, poultry, and nuts.  You are also probably consuming olive oil as a substitute for unhealthy vegetable or coconut oils.  Olive Oil, particularly the extra virgin preparation, contains lots of antioxidants (just look at that rich color; it screams anti-oxidants) and also has significant anti-Inflammatory properties. Everyone knows that these are the two most important properties of healthy foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body clearly benefits from eating olive oil. Does your brain care?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answering this question is not easy. First of all, olive oil is a complex blend of various chemicals. It would be nice to know which of these is most advantageous and whether they influence brain health directly or indirectly. A recent study attempted to find answers using an animal model that mimics conditions of multiple sclerosis in the human brain. Multiple sclerosis is characterized by brain inﬂammation leading to numerous degenerative changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain inflammation present in multiple sclerosis patients is thought to be driven by changes in the gut microbiome. Scientists now understand that the gut microbiome plays a signiﬁcant role in both the progression and severity of the disease. This is the likely scenario: an imbalance in the gut bacteria leads to inflammation, chemical debris released from the bacteria migrate out of the gut into the blood and then into the brain. The most harmful of these bacterial debris is called lipopolysaccharide and it can induce a powerful inflammatory response inside the brain. People with multiple sclerosis have elevated levels of lipopolysaccharide in their brains, spinal cords, and blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olive oil modifies how your gut microbiome communicates with your brain. Olive oil’s beneficial effects on the human brain and body are likely related to the presence of the polyphenols hydroxytyrosol and oleic acid. Hydroxytyrosol protects cells that are under oxidative stress. Oleic acid has beneficial effects on blood cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1080/1028415X.2018.1469281&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of olive oil demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Administering olive oil animals significantly reduced the number of harmful chemicals that can cause tissue injury and aging, particularly within the brain. Olive oil administration also increased levels of the enzymes that provide protection against oxidative damage in the brain and also reduces the negative actions the lipopolysaccharide released by bacteria in the gut. Olive oil also reduced the level of inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, yes, your brain benefits a lot from adding olive oil to your diet and these benefits originate in response to the changes that olive oil makes to your gut microbiome. Olive oil should become a big part of the diet for anyone with an aging brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: Photo by Steve Buissinne from &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/olive-oil-salad-dressing-cooking-968657/&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-olive-oil-promotes-brain-health/&quot;&gt;How olive oil promotes brain health&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620131832/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620131832/oupblogpsychology,&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620131832/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/a-guide-to-parent-self-care-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A guide to parent self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/seven-books-on-the-fascinating-human-brain-reading-list/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Seven books on the fascinating human brain [reading list]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-we-can-equip-ourselves-against-climate-change/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How we can equip ourselves against climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 2020 World Happiness Report has been published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, with Finland ranking as the world’s happiest country. “&lt;/strong&gt;Happiness” in the report doesn’t refer to the expression of emotion &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/world/europe/world-happiness-report.html&quot;&gt;writes Maria Cramer&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, but is rather about a sense of satisfaction in life and belief that members of one’s community care for each other — a particularly poignant definition given present circumstances.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39371&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An imaging technique adapted from geophysics could provide a new way of looking at the human brain, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://physicsworld.com/a/seismic-imaging-technology-sees-deep-inside-the-brain/&quot;&gt;reports Ian Randall&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Physics World&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers have traditionally been unable to scan the brain using ultrasound, as the waves are scattered by the skull. But now a team have shown that ultrasound &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be used to record signals from inside the skull, with the help of a method normally used to construct images from below the surface of the Earth based on seismometer recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have developed an AI capable of smelling certain odours&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2237534-ai-can-pick-out-specific-odours-from-a-combination-of-smells/&quot;&gt;reports Gege Li&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist.&lt;/em&gt; Chemical sensors respond to particular odours in the environment, and an algorithm then uses that pattern of response to identify the smell, similar to the processes used by the mammalian olfactory bulb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a myth that autistic people aren’t social&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/autistic-people-make-great-social-partners-if-you-actually-give-them-a-chance/&quot;&gt;writes Scott Barry Kaufmann&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;. Negative impressions about the social life of autistic people are driven by the biases of others –— including researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volunteers who thought they were taking part in a psychedelic drug study experienced mood changes and even hallucinations — but hours into the experience, they learned they had only been taking a placebo&lt;/strong&gt;. At &lt;em&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/the-amazing-psychedelic-bamboozle&quot;&gt;Neuroskeptic describes&lt;/a&gt; the lengths that researchers went to, in order to trick participants into thinking they were taking an active drug. The study highlights the importance of disentangling placebo effects from those actually caused by psychoactive substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can crosswords teach us about memory?&lt;/strong&gt; At &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/this-is-your-brain-on-crosswords/&quot;&gt;Adrienne Raphel examines&lt;/a&gt; how word puzzles provide a glimpse into the inner workings of our mind.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Open Access and Open Science are critical, especially in times of crisis. The COVID-19 outbreak shows how important it is for medical professionals, scientific experts, and every member of the public to have immediate access to the latest science. Equal access to the latest research can assuage public fears or spur government action. Today, we’re happy to report that &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; published its first COVID-19 paper since we started &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/&quot;&gt;fast-tracking submissions on January 31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science leaders have &lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/covid19-open-access-letter.pdf&quot;&gt;recently requested&lt;/a&gt; that the publishing community make their content open and re-usable. PLOS &lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/publishers-make-coronavirus-covid-19-content-freely-available-and-reusable&quot;&gt;already supports&lt;/a&gt;, and calls on others to support, COVID-19 research being shared such that it can be centrally text- and data-mined, and also versioned in places where it can be most conveniently discovered by those tackling this crisis in real time. We always push &lt;u&gt;all &lt;/u&gt;PLOS content to PubMed Central.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230548&quot;&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; was conducted by Mingli Yuan and colleagues from the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The researchers studied 27 patients infected with COVID-19 and admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan. In this patient group, the authors associated clinical features identified from computed tomography (CT) scans of patients’ lungs with eventual outcomes. They scored patients based on features they observed such as ground glass opacity, abnormality on both sides, and widespread distribution of pathology in the lungs, to produce an overall severity score for each patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Yuan adds: “This study allows us to compare radiologic findings with the mortality of patients infected with COVID-19.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since February 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, PLOS’ family of journals have received approximately 175 coronavirus-related submissions. This paper had a turnaround time of less than 21 days from submission to acceptance. A fast, open and transparent process of publishing reliable, peer reviewed science &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;its underlying data is an important contribution towards tackling this outbreak, and we are happy to make contributions to this effort. We are forwarding all of our submissions to the World Health Organization for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov&quot;&gt;database of publications on coronavirus disease (COVID-19)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are compiling all our Coronavirus-related papers into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://collections.plos.org/covid-19&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/a&gt; as they publish. Meanwhile, you can keep tabs on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://channels.plos.org/dfs&quot;&gt;Disease Forecasting and Surveillance Channel&lt;/a&gt; for curated research related to coronavirus. We encourage all researchers investigating pressing issues like disease outbreaks and climate change, to also consider posting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/why-preprint&quot;&gt;Preprint&lt;/a&gt;.  You can find the most recent preprints relating to the coronavirus outbreak – posted across bioRxiv and medRxiv on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/181&quot;&gt;search link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults are vulnerable to all kinds of body illusions. We can be made to feel that a&lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-27/edition-3/interview-people-have-been-ignoring-body-long-time&quot;&gt; fake hand, or even a fake body, is our own; that we’ve left our body; even that we’re the size of a doll&lt;/a&gt;. These illusions work because our brains use information from various senses to create mental representations of our bodies. Mess with some of these sensory signals, and you can alter those representations, sometimes drastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work to date suggests that young children don’t show the same susceptibilities to body illusions, presumably because the systems that underpin them are still developing. Now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59979-0&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;, has found that a bizarre auditory-induced illusion that affects adults doesn’t work in quite the same way in young kids, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39359&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/10/28/how-listening-to-an-ipod-shrinks-your-sense-of-personal-space/&quot;&gt;Ana Tajadura-Jiménez&lt;/a&gt;, now at Charles III University of in Madrid, has led all kinds of fascinating work showing that body illusions can be triggered through the manipulation of sound. Take her “&lt;a href=&quot;http://magicshoes.es/the-team/&quot;&gt;magic shoes&lt;/a&gt;“, for example. Microphones record the sound of the wearer walking. But this sound is then filtered, so only the the higher-pitched portions are played on to them, through earphones. This has the effect of making the wearer sound lighter, which leads them to report &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; lighter and more sprightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new study, Elena Nava at the University of Milano-Bicocca and Tajadura-Jiménez turned to what’s known as the “auditory Pinocchio illusion”. In earlier work, Tajadura-Jiménez and colleagues had found that if adults pull up on their index finger while listening to brief sounds of rising pitch, they have the feeling that their finger is getting longer. Why? Other research has found that we associate a “high” pitch with a high position in physical space, and so, Tajadura-Jiménez suspects, this metaphor is influencing our perceptions. Like adults, even babies get the “high” vs “low” pitch metaphor — so perhaps young children would experience this illusion, too. But when the pair tried a version of it on a group of 30 four- to six-year-olds, and on a group of 30 adults, they found some differences between the responses of the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this study, the participants didn’t pull on their own fingers. Rather, they pressed their palm up against a vertical wooden surface, and their hand was screened with a cloth, so they couldn’t see it. An experimenter then repeatedly either pulled or pressed on their middle finger while they heard a tone that ascended in pitch, descended in pitch or remained constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; data-shortcode=&quot;caption&quot; id=&quot;attachment_39361&quot; style=&quot;width: 202px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Navva &amp;amp;amp; Tajadura-Jimenez 2020&quot; class=&quot;  wp-image-39361 aligncenter&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;39361&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Navva &amp;amp;amp; Tajadura-Jimenez 2020&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020.png?w=491&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020.png?w=225&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;491,655&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/19/this-weird-sound-induced-illusion-makes-you-feel-that-your-finger-has-grown-longer/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020/&quot; height=&quot;269&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020.png?w=202&amp;amp;h=269&quot; width=&quot;202&quot; /&gt;Example of the experimental set-up. &lt;em&gt;Via&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59979-0&quot;&gt;Nava &amp;amp; Tajadura-Jiménez (2020)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time, the participant used a scale on the side of the board to indicate where they felt the tip of their middle finger to be in space. They were also asked about whether they &lt;em&gt;perceived&lt;/em&gt; their finger to be getting longer, shrinking, or staying the same length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that when ascending notes were played during finger-pulling, adults indicated that their middle finger tip was higher (and so the finger was longer) than it actually was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children, on the other hand, did not indicate that their finger tip was higher during these ascending notes — and yet like the adults, they reported &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; that their finger was getting longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that by around the age of four to six, a child’s thoughts and feelings about what’s happening to its body — its “body image” — is adult-like (at least, in this context). However, its unconscious body “schema” — the brain’s map of the body in space — is not yet being calibrated in the same way as an adult’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers did not find that tones of descending pitch played while the finger was being pressed made adults or children think that their finger was getting smaller. “Why can the brain ‘accept’ a longer finger but not a shorter one?” the researchers ask. “This asymmetry could reflect the fact that the brain experiences, throughout development, the enlargement of most parts of the body, while it never experiences shrinkage,” they suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a subsequent study, the pair then tried a version of the same experiment, but with the participants’ arms and hands positioned horizontally, rather than vertically. In this orientation, the longer finger effect that they had just found in adults was not repeated. As the high/low metaphor for pitch is vertical in nature, not horizontal, this “supports our hypothesis that crossmodal ‘metaphoric’ correspondences influence the binding of multisensory information,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; data-shortcode=&quot;caption&quot; id=&quot;attachment_39363&quot; style=&quot;width: 196px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Navva &amp;amp;amp; Tajadura-Jimenez 2020_2&quot; class=&quot;  wp-image-39363 aligncenter&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;39363&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Navva &amp;amp;amp; Tajadura-Jimenez 2020_2&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020_2.png?w=487&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020_2.png?w=224&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020_2.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;487,653&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/19/this-weird-sound-induced-illusion-makes-you-feel-that-your-finger-has-grown-longer/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020_2/&quot; height=&quot;263&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/navva-tajadura-jimenez-2020_2.png?w=196&amp;amp;h=263&quot; width=&quot;196&quot; /&gt;In the second experiment participants’ hands were positioned horizontally. &lt;em&gt;Via&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59979-0&quot;&gt;Nava &amp;amp; Tajadura-Jiménez (2020)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They would now like to see further work to establish when a child’s body map becomes adult-like, and also to explore whether individual differences in the way signals from various senses are integrated might predict our susceptibilities to body illusions.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;By Joerg Heber, Editorial Director, PLOS and Editor-in-Chief, &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As the global research community, along with everyone else, adopts measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, we wanted to update you on how we are dealing with the situation at PLOS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLOS Operations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If you have a paper in process at any PLOS journal, it is being processed as normal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are conscious of the challenges that many of you face during this crisis. We will remain supportive and flexible, which may affect individual paper processing times (more below). We are also carefully monitoring the health and well-being of our staff, managing and coordinating workloads, and supporting each other with flexibility. While the situation is far from normal in both of our primary locations (USA and UK), at this point we do not anticipate issues preventing the efficient publishing of our seven journals. We are facilitating the prompt evaluation of any papers related to the coronavirus and resulting pandemic, and all other papers are also being handled as per our standard processes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reassurance for Our Research Communities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We understand that the global research community is significantly but also variably affected by this pandemic, and so we want to provide the following clarifications and reassurance:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To Authors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are flexible regarding turnaround times for revisions and other tasks during this stressful time. Please keep in touch with us if you need any extensions or if you experience any challenges around manuscript preparation; we will work with you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are fast-tracking all relevant research related to the coronavirus and resulting pandemic, and are processing all other submissions as normal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are forwarding all submissions and papers related to the outbreak to the World Health Organization for their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;database &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;of publications on coronavirus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We encourage all researchers to also consider posting a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Preprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Please remember that – across all our journals – we protect primary research studies from being considered “scooped” by closely related, parallel studies recently published in other journals. So, there is no need to rush your research, or revisions, for the sake of being selected for novelty!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To Reviewers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If you have agreed to do a review, or would like to do a review, for a PLOS journal but need extra time, please just let us know. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If you can, please review &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/181&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Preprints related to coronavirus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; directly via the preprint’s commenting options or on the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://outbreaksci.prereview.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Rapid PreReview server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;  — this can speed up the review process down the line, as constructive comments may be vetted and used in a review process at a journal (read about PLOS’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;initiative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;) or authors can respond rapidly to comments made&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In light of the now-limited resources for experimental research due to closed laboratories, we encourage you to carefully consider the need for additional experiments or analyses in revision requests, especially if the conclusions are adequately supported by the data. (Note: while we recommend this for all journals during this crisis, this is always standard practice at PLOS ONE and simply a reminder in this case.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To Editors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;How companies and teams make decisions can be very challenging. Poor or ill-structured decision-making processes can make the organization less successful and create destructive conflicts in decision-making teams. But there are a few strategies companies can try that help organizations make big decisions in a better way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People operate in complex and dynamic environments, making decisions with limited information under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity. In contrast to routine decisions, strategic decisions are often made at top-management level and they have an impact on the whole organization in terms of its future direction and the scope of its activities. Such important decisions have a significant impact of the organization’s resource allocation that require trade-offs between alternatives and the setting of organizational priorities. In addition the strategic decision making process  rarely results in one clear best solution to the problem, but an organization makes a  decision it will be difficult to reverse. This is because the implementation of a decision involves a significant resource commitment and change in organizational activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we have ways to assess risk through probability theory, dealing with strategic decision problems is much more difficult where the information we gather to support a decision and the actual decision outcomes are uncertain and ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxfordre.com/psychology/psychology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-262&quot;&gt;In complex decision situations, groups are better at solving problems than acting alone&lt;/a&gt;. This may be because group members bring a variety of information, critical judgment, solution strategies, and a wide range of perspectives to the decision problem. However, groups can be subject to destructive conflict and cognitive biases that may hinder the quality of decision outcomes and group members’ decision acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main group decision-making biases are &lt;em&gt;risky shift&lt;/em&gt;, as groups tend to make risker decisions than individuals alone, and &lt;em&gt;groupthink&lt;/em&gt;, as group members strive for consensus and harmony in their decision-making. In addition, group conflict may arise when people with competing opinions and solution alternatives clash.  Group decision-making, therefore, presents a managerial conundrum. On the one hand, multiple perspectives of group members can add insight into the problem situation. On the other hand, group diversity can produce fragmentation, conflict, or groupthink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group member interaction in decision-making situations may produce two types of conflict: cognitive and affective conflict. Task-focused&lt;em&gt; cognitive conflict&lt;/em&gt; arises when group members focus on a task or an issue and debate to come up with a creative solution.  Cognitive conflict improves decision-making quality as the goal of the decision-makers is to find the best possible solution rather than win the argument. However, there is a danger that this beneficial cognitive conflict spills into a dysfunctional, affective conflict. Instead of working constructively to achieve the best possible solution, the debate becomes personal, adversarial, and a lose-win paradigm where one view prevails while others are discarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affective conflict tends to be emotional and focuses on personal incompatibilities or disputes. These disputes can result from group members’ personal judgments that they are not fully able to explain to group members. The more these personal judgments influence decisions, the more there is potential for decision-making group members to speculate and find reasons to distrust the motivation and hidden agendas of other group members. Hence, too much affective conflict may hinder overall group performance as the decision will not be accepted by some decision-making group members regardless of the quality of the decision outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management consultants have developed several decision-making techniques to encourage critical interaction between decision-making group members. &lt;em&gt;Devil’s advocacy&lt;/em&gt; is a decision-making technique where one or more people in the group works to point out all the flaws and risks with an option under consideration. &lt;em&gt;Dialectical inquiry&lt;/em&gt; is a decision-making technique where divide into two camps: those advocating for an idea and those advocating against it. Both sides highlight the advantages of their assigned decision and outline the disadvantages of the opposing idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both dialectical inquiry and devil’s advocacy lead to higher quality assumptions and decision outcomes than a consensus approach in decision-making. However, consensus-seeking groups express more satisfaction and desire to continue to work with their groups and indicate a greater level of decision acceptance than those who were asked to apply dialectical inquiry and devil’s advocacy in their groups’ decision-making process. Hence, management scholars’ attention has turned to developing techniques that maintain moderate levels of cognitive conflict to ensure high quality decision outcomes, but simultaneously preserve group cohesion to prevent emergence of affective conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Causal mapping is a visual decision-making technique that is designed to help groups improve their strategic decision-making processes and promote cognitive conflict, while at the same time preventing the emergence of affective conflict&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Visual tools are particularly useful in strategy work as decisions are often made collectively in group working situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a causal map, ideas are causally linked to one another through the use of arrows and nodes. The arrows indicate how one idea or action leads to another. In effect, the maps are word-and-arrow diagrams where the arrows mean “might cause,” “might lead to,” or “might result in.” Causal mapping facilitates a visual articulation of a large number of ideas, actions, and their consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example of a fully developed causal map is depicted in below. The map incorporates the collective understanding of a decision-problem by a decision-making group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;310&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/gggggg-180x90.jpg&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; /&gt;Image Credits: Mikko Arevuo, ‘Epistemic objects in collective decision-making: a practice perspective on the use of causal maps as situated material artifacts’, PhD Thesis, Cranfield School of Management, Cranfield CERES (2015). [accessed 16.07.2019]&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Causal maps that have been created in groups bring together the thinking of many people, including conflicting views, subtly different slants on the same issues, and different perspectives held by individual people. Such causal maps provide simplified representations of the beliefs of the greater group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group causal mapping could be perceived as a form of brainstorming, but there is a distinction between group maps and a free-flowing brainstorming of ideas. Group mapping that is used for decision-making is focused on raising issues and concerns. These are usually activities or events that can either support or challenge the decision-making aspiration of the group. In contrast to eliciting “off-the-wall” ideas in group brainstorming sessions as the means of unleashing creativity, group mapping focuses on bringing together the group members’ current wisdom and experience, as well as issues surrounding the problem. Therefore, group mapping is a process of engaging in a dialogue to uncover the causality between the problem and a number of potential solution outcomes, represented as a visual object. The mapping process provides the means for the decision-making group to structure and merge differing perspectives that should lead eventually into a shared understanding of the issue in a holistic manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.amazon.co.uk/Visual-Strategy-Mapping-Nonprofit-Organizations-ebook/dp/B00JZUPLPU/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1583250943&amp;amp;refinements=p_27%3AJohn+M.+Bryson&amp;amp;s=digital-text&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;text=John+M.+Bryson&quot;&gt;There is increasing evidence that&lt;/a&gt; the causal mapping process prevents decision-making groups from talking over each other and going around in circles. It helps group members to speak and be heard. The mapping process produces a lot of ideas and can ultimately clarify the most suitable course of action. Furthermore, the shared and collective enactment of a group causal map can increase individual ownership, acceptance, and the feeling of fairness of the decision outcomes. This is because the map shows evidence that people have listened to everyone in the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: AbsolutVision, ‘Photo of bulb artwork’ via &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/82TpEld0_e4&quot;&gt;Unsplash &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-strategists-are-improving-team-decision-making-processes/&quot;&gt;How strategists are improving team decision-making processes&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620039770/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620039770/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fgggggg-180x90.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620039770/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/maria-edgeworth-jane-austens-forgotten-idol/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Maria Edgeworth, Jane Austen’s forgotten idol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/yesterdays-fake-news-donald-trump-as-a-1980s-literary-critic/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Yesterday’s fake news: Donald Trump as a 1980s literary critic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/why-its-so-hard-to-write-a-william-wordsworth-biography/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why it’s so hard to write a William Wordsworth biography&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/adult-aging-alone-american-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrated care is characterized by a proactive and person-centered approach to care, which is seamlessly coordinated across multiple professional disciplines and care interfaces. Integrated care aims to improve outcomes such as functioning, quality of life, and quality of care. The organisation of integrated primary and community care is considered an essential step towards supporting older people to age in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintaining people’s safety at home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support older people living at home, it is essential to maintain their safety. Older people encounter limitations in multiple domains of life, which could pose risks to their ability to live safely and independently at home. Such risks may relate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/47/6/830/626240&quot;&gt;different factors&lt;/a&gt;, including people’s functioning and behavior, their physical and social environments, and the health and social care they receive. This wide range of risks could lead to a multitude of problems that challenge people’s safety at home, ultimately resulting in emergency department visits, (re)hospitalization, institutionalization and mortality. Given its proactive, interdisciplinary and comprehensive character, integrated care is expected to provide opportunities to address &lt;a href=&quot;https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/18/6/424.long&quot;&gt;the prevention of such risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-1482-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;Our recently published scoping review&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Geriatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that integrated care programs for older people living at home address a broad range of safety risks. After examining included programs according to the predefined conceptual framework shown in Figure 1, findings show that all programs addressed risks related to people’s functioning and behavior, and several programs addressed risks associated with people’s health and social care management. Fewer programs addressed risks related to people’s social and physical environments. However, as the number of people receiving care and support at home keeps rising, risks related to people’s socio-economic conditions, their home environments, and increasing caregiver responsibilities, for example, are becoming more prominent. Therefore, addressing such risks is important, especially since &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-017-0521-5&quot;&gt;older people themselves also express their concerns&lt;/a&gt; regarding these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11783&quot; style=&quot;width: 299px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11783 size-full&quot; height=&quot;289&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/pic.jpg&quot; width=&quot;289&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 1. Domains of risks that could challenge people’s ability to live safely at home.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timely identification of risks, combined with relevant clinical, behavioral and environmental interventions and support, as well as care coordination or case management, would enhance care providers’ ability to support older people’s safety at home. Prioritizing such a proactive and multidimensional approach requires combining the expertise of professionals from different disciplines of health and social care. However, our scoping review suggests that these linkages between health and social care are not yet common practice in integrated care programs for older people living at home. Investing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016885101930260X&quot;&gt;collaborative skills&lt;/a&gt; and inter-professional dynamics, as well as addressing financial and organisational incentives for collaboration, are deemed necessary to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6484371/&quot;&gt;strengthen these linkages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balancing safety, autonomy, quality of care and quality of life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review showed that integrated care programs can potentially incorporate many ways of addressing and preventing risks. However, it remains challenging to priorities these activities in a way that is meaningful for older people. Adopting a person-centered way of working, in which professional expertise is tailored to people’s individual needs and preferences, is considered one of the core components of integrated care. In this light, it is important to acknowledge that safety is not the only aspect to consider, especially in the care provided in the context of people’s homes. People’s homes are not only care settings, but the setting of their daily lives, and older people may have preferences or make choices that value quality of life over safety. This means that safety risks cannot be addressed independently of older people’s perspectives. Instead, professionals are tasked to consider their professional perceptions in combination with older people’s preferences, and find a balance between aspects such as safety, prevention, autonomy and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truly supporting people to age in place requires a societal shift towards a broader paradigm of health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in practice, this raises the question of responsibility and accountability for the safety of older people living at home. Naturally, professionals have no control over how older people live their lives and the choices they make. As such, professionals cannot be held accountable for the adverse consequences of those choices. What then, exactly, is the responsibility of health and social care professionals? And what is the responsibility of older people themselves, their families, or society? How is accountability for adverse events shared across these different stakeholders? These questions necessitate a widespread debate on our perceptions and expectations of quality of care, prevention, and ethics, as well as individual, professional and societal responsibility and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding the health care paradigm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concluding, integrated care provides both a platform and tools that could be harnessed further to support older people living at home in a manner that balances safety with other values important to older people. However, it is important to note that efforts to integrate health and social care alone are not enough. Truly supporting people to age in place requires a societal shift towards a broader paradigm of health and well-being – a paradigm that recognizes the role that health, social, and environmental factors play in older people’s ability to live safely at home, and in which many different actors in the wider community play their part and perform their responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though some &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/01/23/do-smells-really-trigger-particularly-evocative-memories/&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has challenged the common conception that scent is the most evocative of all the senses, it can be undeniably powerful when you catch a whiff of something that jogs a memory. We also &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/30/people-with-a-keener-sense-of-smell-find-sex-more-pleasant-and-if-they-are-female-have-more-orgasms-during-sex/&quot;&gt;know&lt;/a&gt; that scent plays a part in sexual attraction: people with a keener sense of smell often find sex more pleasant and may even have more orgasms during sex, and the scent of a partner can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29293018&quot;&gt;reduce stress&lt;/a&gt; and increase feelings of safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So new research findings from a team at the University of British Columbia may not come as a complete surprise. In a paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620905615?rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;amp;journalCode=pssa&quot;&gt;published in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620905615?rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;amp;journalCode=pssa&quot;&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Marlise Hofer and Frances Chen suggest that the scent of your lover may not just be comforting but can also help you drift off to sleep.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39349&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team asked 155 heterosexual participants in long-term romantic relationships to sleep with a t-shirt for a pillowcase on two separate nights. One of these shirts had previously been worn for 24 hours by their romantic partner, and the other was a control shirt, which had either not been worn, or worn by a “scent donor” unknown to participants. T-shirt wearers were asked to refrain from using any scented body products and to avoid activities likely to produce odours such as exercise, smoking, sex or eating pungent foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each night, participants’ “sleep efficiency” — i.e. the proportion of time they spent in bed that they were actually asleep — was measured via a smartwatch  Then, in the morning, participants were asked what time they went to bed and got up, how they would rate their sleep quality, how well rested they felt, and whether or not they believed the scent was their partner’s or the control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, sleep efficiency was higher on nights spent sleeping with a partner’s shirt rather than with a control shirt — and this was still the case when controlling for multiple factors, including participants’ relationship quality and length, attachment style and levels of stress. Efficiency was increased by an average of 2.1% — around the same increase induced by melatonin supplements, often used to improve sleep. And though participants were able to identify their partner’s scent 70% of the time, the results also suggested that sleep efficiency improved whether or not participants were aware that the t-shirt was their partner’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to sleep quality, however, participants only reported having higher quality sleep when they &lt;em&gt;believed&lt;/em&gt; they were spending the night with their partner’s shirt, whether or not they were actually exposed to their smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual differences, the team notes, are likely to moderate these effects, something the study did not explore in depth. Women, for example, were more likely to see an increase in sleep efficiency than men, and factors like relationship quality are likely to have a variety of impacts on both quality and efficiency of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for anyone who’s ever struggled to drift off when alone, the results are still cheering. Melatonin is all well and good — but a worn t-shirt could be the real secret to getting a good night’s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620905615?rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;amp;journalCode=pssa&quot;&gt;The Scent of a Good Night’s Sleep: Olfactory Cues of a Romantic Partner Improve Sleep Efficiency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Rampant panic buying, superstore shelves emptied of toilet paper, selfish people hoarding hand sanitizer. Worries about elderly relatives, jobs, money, health care costs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already have a serious anxiety disorder, how can you possibly cope in the current climate of fear and uncertainty? What if one of the core recommendations to help prevent disease transmission is the very pathology you've worked so hard to overcome?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contamination fears cause many individuals with OCD to compulsively wash their hands. Meanwhile, the directive to frequently wash your hands with soap &amp;amp; water for 20 seconds could be quite triggering for some. The International OCD Foundation has provided helpful resources:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iocdf.org/covid19/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Resources for the OCD and related disorders community during the COVID-19 outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;In times like these, what the experts are recommending temporarily becomes our new normal.  This may mean that you need to make some changes to your treatment, including which exposures you do, when you do them, how frequently, etc. What might normally be considered a “baseline” for people with OCD to aspire to should shift to match the recommended guidelines for as long as those guidelines are in place. A good suggestion would be to talk about the guidelines with your treatment team at your next session and go over how, if at all, your plan might change for the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important for all of us in the OCD and related disorders community to remember that this is temporary, and understand that it may feel uncomfortable. You are not going backwards in your recovery journey because the baseline changes. These troubled times will end, and you will keep doing your best in the meantime.&lt;/blockquote&gt;They also provide recommendations for what you should and should NOT do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Examples of &lt;b&gt;What to do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;set a time limit of 5 minutes &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;per day for reading news and updates from &lt;b&gt;trusted sources&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;take breaks and allow yourself to do things you enjoy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;consult your treatment team &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;u&gt;Examples of &lt;b&gt;What NOT to do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;avoid the temptation to learn “everything” about COVID-19&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;do not excessively wash your hands &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;don’t let “social distancing” rob you of your support networks &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;

Some patients on an acute psychiatric unit may be agitated, uncooperative, or even violent, and it’s not hard to imagine the distress of anyone who has a patient spit on them as we’re all trying to remember not to shake hands. Inevitably, there will be patients who present for psychiatric admission with no respiratory symptoms, who are admitted and then become ill and are diagnosed with COVID-19. In the meantime, the potential is there for contagion to other patients on the unit, the hospital staff, and visitors to the unit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Readers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; if you have any suggestions for helpful resources or personal coping strategies, feel free to comment here or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/neurocritic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;feedflare&quot;&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be the best-studied of all our senses, but surprises about the way our vision works just keep on coming. Recent research has startling and also salutary lessons about how we see.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39341&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your brain makes up a lot of what you “see”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re walking around or sitting at a desk, you no doubt feel that you can see pretty clearly all around you. Yes, so you might be looking ahead as you walk through a park, say, but you can see a rich world of grass, trees and people to either side of you. Well, you might be seeing it — but that doesn’t mean it’s all actually there. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797616672270&quot;&gt;research published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; in 2016&lt;/a&gt; revealed, your brain uses information from the clearly-focused central region of the visual field to fill in detail in the relatively data-poor periphery. In fact, as the lead author, Marte Otten at the University of Amsterdam, commented at the time, “Our findings show that, under the right circumstances, a large part of the periphery may be a visual illusion”. It’s what’s known as a “uniformity illusion”, and you can try it for yourself at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uniformillusion.com&quot;&gt;www.uniformillusion.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, not all peripheral vision is the same… &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/114/17/E3573&quot;&gt;work published the following year&lt;/a&gt; suggests that we all have “good” and “bad” regions. Some of the participants in this study, led by John Greenwood at UCL, had sharper left-side than right-side peripheral vision, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this could have real-world effects, says Greenwood — someone searching a room for missing keys, for example, could fail to spot those keys if they’re on their “bad” side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s easy to make someone hallucinate (without drugs)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a willing partner to hand, you can try one hallucination-inducing technique right now. All you have to do, according to research led by Giovanni Caputo and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/18/weird-things-start-to-happen-when-you-stare-into-someones-eyes-for-10-minutes/&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Psychiatry Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is to sit in chairs placed opposite each other, about a metre apart, in a fairly dimly lit room, and look into each other’s eyes. When the 20 young adults in the study tried this for 10 minutes, they reported all kinds of odd experiences. Along with altered perceptions of sounds and time, 90 per cent saw some deformed facial features, while three-quarters said they saw a monster. A state of dissociation might explain these results, the researchers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/09/researchers-show-there-is-a-simple-way-to-induce-synesthesia-in-people-with-normal-perception/&quot;&gt;published last year by Anupama Nair and David Brang&lt;/a&gt;, found that it’s possible to induce synaesthesia-type visual sensations in regular people. For this work, participants sat with their eyes closed in a darkened room for five minutes. Then they were given a simple mental imagery task, designed purely to raise activity levels in the visual cortex. During this task, occasional, unpredictably-timed beeps were played. Overall, nearly 60 per cent reported at least one sound-induced visual perception, such as seeing colourful small circles, flashes or sparkles of light or visual pulses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s known that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(14)00458-8?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982214004588?showall=true&quot;&gt;visual cortex processes auditory data, too&lt;/a&gt;. Short-term visual deprivation can, it seems, make it more likely that sounds will actually trigger visual hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time stops when you blink&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For about 10% of your waking hours, your eyes are actually shut, because of blinking. Your brain stitches together retinal information from around these gaps, giving you the impression that your vision is uninterrupted. However, these brief but regular dark moments do have an impact: a study led by Ayelet Landau suggests they cause your sense of the passing of time to stop temporarily. This work, published in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; in 2019 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/14/your-brain-stops-time-when-you-blink/&quot;&gt;covered by me on the Research Digest&lt;/a&gt;, shows that processing in the visual cortex influences our perceptions of time. It’s possible that when we’re engaged in tasks that stimulate plenty of other senses (when we’re outside, say, rather than sitting at a desk, staring at a screen, reading about psychological research…), this effect could be counteracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can see infrared and ultraviolet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few animals, such as pit vipers and common vampire bats, are infamous for being able to sense the infrared body heat of their prey. This is not a human ability. In fact, we’re not meant to be able to detect infrared at all. However, as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/111/50/E5445&quot;&gt;initially serendipitous discovery by researchers at the University of Washington reveals&lt;/a&gt;, there are very particular circumstances in which it becomes possible. While working with an infrared laser, which is meant to be invisible to the human eye, researchers at the university reported seeing occasional green flashes. Vladimir Kefalov and colleagues investigated. They found that if two long-wavelength infrared photons of light hit a light-sensitive molecule in a cone cell in the retina in rapid succession, they have the same energy impact as a shorter, visible photon — and this triggers a green perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If such infrared vision is very rare, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/lastword/mg24432591-000-super-seers-why-some-people-can-see-ultraviolet-light/&quot;&gt;anecdotal reports&lt;/a&gt; that seeing very short, ultraviolet wavelengths of light — an ability normally associated with birds and butterflies, for instance — is much more achievable. The cornea and lens absorb this light, so, it’s true, we normally can’t see it. However, people who have had their lenses removed — often because of cataracts — have reported seeing (in blueish-purple) everything from patterns on flowers to ultraviolet light beams from counterfeit banknote detectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Childhood experience can create strange visual categories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It probably wouldn’t surprise you to learn that you have dedicated circuits of neurons in your visual cortex dedicated to processing particular categories of visual stimulus — such as one for faces, and another for words. But, it seems, these category regions are established through experience in childhood, and as long as your youthful experience with a given type of visual stimulus is intense enough, your visual cortex may well set up a dedicated response unit to handle it on into adulthood. The main recent evidence for this comes from a study by Jesse Gomez and his team, showing that adults who played Pokémon extensively as kids had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/06/14/adults-who-played-pokemon-extensively-in-childhood-have-a-pokemon-sensitive-region-in-their-visual-cortex/&quot;&gt;visual region that was more active when viewing Pokémon characters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you’re afraid, you literally see things differently&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a popular model of perception, what you see is generally a function of data coming from the retina to your brain and what your brain expects to see. Depending on the situation, sometimes the retinal data will be given more weight, but other times the brain will rely more on expectation in generating your visual perceptions. We all have a tendency to err on the side of caution — given the potential risk vs benefit, if you’re walking through snake-infested territory, say, it’s safer to see a long shape on the ground as a snake rather than a stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13854&quot;&gt;work published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; in 2017&lt;/a&gt; provided evidence that when our heart is beating rapidly — when we’re afraid (and perhaps also angry) — we’re especially likely to see threats when there are none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, racial biases also came into play. The team —Ruben Azevedo, Sarah Garfinkel, Hugo Critchley and Manos Tsakiris — showed images of either black or white individuals holding either a gun or a mobile phone. When the images were presented on the heartbeat, rather than between heartbeats, they were 10% more likely to see the object as a gun when it was held by a black person. The researchers think this effect might explain at least some shootings of black unarmed men by police officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/14/what-does-fear-do-to-our-vision/&quot;&gt;published a year earlier by Maria Lojowska’s team&lt;/a&gt;, found that when we’re afraid, we perceive some aspects of the world more clearly, but at the cost of ignoring much of the detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to mess with your colleagues’ minds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many optical illusions are presented in 2D, on paper, or on a computer screen. But in 2018, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/02/14/a-psychologist-noticed-this-cool-chair-illusion-in-his-office/&quot;&gt;mind-bending 3D chair illusion&lt;/a&gt; showed itself in the office of Nick Scott-Samuel at the University of Bristol. The set of stackable chairs seem to be arranged in an impossible position — a little like an Escher drawing, only stranger. This is because, Scott-Samuel and his colleagues report, the brain gets confused about apparent depth cues when &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/2041669517752372/suppl_file/StackingChairsMovie.mp4&quot;&gt;viewing the chairs at an angle&lt;/a&gt;. Just four chairs are apparently enough to achieve the effect. So next time you’re early for a meeting, you know what to do…&lt;/p&gt;

 As Retraction Watch readers know, reporting on the same data more than once — without notifying editors and readers — is bad for the scientific record and can lead to a retraction. Apparently, in the rush to publish findings about the coronavirus pandemic, some researchers are doing just that.

 &lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_578&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/03/eleonora.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Image of Eleonora Presani, Executive Director of arXiv&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-578 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/03/eleonora-300x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Eleonora Presani, Executive Director&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s leading source of open access scientific research, is pleased to welcome Dr. Eleonora Presani as its first executive director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Presani earned her PhD in astroparticle physics at the University of Amsterdam and then completed her postdoc at CERN, where she worked remotely on the International Space Station’s AMS02 instrument. After that, she was publisher at Elsevier for high energy physics journals, and her projects included SCOAP3, SoftwareX, and Physics of the Dark Universe. In the last four years her career shifted to digital product development, working as Product Manager in Scopus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As executive director, Dr. Presani now leads arXiv’s operations, as well as technical and business planning, governance, and fundraising efforts. Based in New York City, she oversees a growing staff distributed across Cornell University’s Ithaca campus, Cornell Tech in NYC, and other locations. She also coordinates a global network of volunteer advisory board members and moderators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am honored and thrilled to take the helm of arXiv, a groundbreaking service with incredible potential for technological growth and innovative development,” Dr. Presani says. “arXiv was a ‘disrupter’ of traditional academic publishing before the world wide web became popular, and it continues to be a central point of global scientific knowledge sharing. I have been a user of arXiv since my undergraduate study in physics, and it was such an important source of information to me throughout my academic career, as it has been and continues to be for millions of researchers around the world. I look forward to engaging with the scientific and member advisory boards, as well as the larger, global community, to take us to the next level, and make this knowledge more accessible to everyone who wants it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Presani is passionate about bringing the art and complexities of technology to a wider audience, using accessible and creative methods. She also enjoys bridging together systems and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are very fortunate to have someone of Eleonora’s experience and background joining the arXiv team,” says Carol Hoover, member of arXiv’s Member Advisory Board (MAB) and Digital Information Resources Manager at Los Alamos National Laboratory Research Library. “She is a strong communicator with deep technical capabilities and has a solid understanding of arXiv’s purpose and mission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Licia Verde, chair of arXiv’s Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) and ICREA Professor, says, “We are proud that we can count on Eleonora, her skills, talents and expertise in scientific dissemination and the publishing ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;arXiv was founded in 1991 by physicist Paul Ginsparg and is a groundbreaking invention that popularized free, open-access scholarly research. Today, it continues to allow researchers from around the world to share scientific findings quickly, in fields ranging from astrophysics to economics. More than 180 moderators shepherd scholarly articles through the submission process, and more than 230 institutional members contribute financial support, in addition to the Simons Foundation, Cornell University, and other funders. arXiv has grown exponentially in the past decade, with more than 1.6 million submissions and more than a billion downloads in its 29-year history.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-us">
 &lt;p&gt;The human brain is often described as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-18233409&quot;&gt;most complex object in the known universe&lt;/a&gt; – we know so much, and yet so little, about the way it works. It’s no wonder then that the study of brain today encompasses an enormous range of topics, from abstract understanding of consciousness to microscopic exploration of billions of neurons. Brain Awareness Week takes place this year March 16-22. To mark the occasion, we’ve put together a list of books that explore the matter between your ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/birth-of-intelligence-9780190908324&quot;&gt;Birth of Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Daeyeol Lee &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is intelligence? Does a high level of biological intelligence require a complex brain? Can man-made machines be truly intelligent? In &lt;em&gt;Birth of Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;, distinguished neuroscientist Daeyeol Lee tackles pressing issues that will be key to preparing for future society and its technology, including how the use of AI will impact our lives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-not-to-train-the-brain-9780198789673&quot;&gt;How (not) to train the brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amir Raz and Sheida Rabipour &lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ENihhJkDjS0-143x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;143&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can we improve cognitive performance through deliberate training? The short answer is yes, albeit with some caveats. In this book, the authors review data from hundreds of articles and provide an overarching account of the field, separating scientific evidence from publicity myth and guiding readers through how they should – and should not – train the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-evolutionary-road-to-human-memory-9780198828051&quot;&gt;The Evolutionary Road to Human Memory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Elisabeth A. Murray, Steven P. Wise, Mary K. L. Baldwin, and Kim S. Graham &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book tells an intriguing story about how evolution shaped human memory. As our ancestors faced the problems and opportunities of their time, their brains developed new forms of memory that helped them gain an advantage in life. Sometime during human evolution, another new kind of memory emerged that ignited the human imagination, and empowered every individual, day upon day, to add new pages to the story of a life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/musical-illusions-and-phantom-words-9780190206833&quot;&gt;Musical Illusions and Phantom Words&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Diana Deutsch &lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EF4XXCFsD6Q-145x220.png&quot; width=&quot;145&quot; /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is perfect pitch so rare? Why do some people hallucinate music or speech? In this ground-breaking synthesis of art and science, Diana Deutsch, one of the world’s leading experts on the psychology of music, shows how illusions of music and speech—many of which she herself discovered—have fundamentally altered thinking about the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/sex-lies-and-brain-scans-9780198752882&quot;&gt;Sex, Lies, and Brain Scans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barbara J. Sahakian and Julia Gottwald &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sex, Lies, and Brain Scans&lt;/em&gt; takes readers beyond the media headlines. The authors consider what the technique of fMRI entails, and important ethical questions these techniques raise. Should individuals applying for jobs be screened for unconscious racial bias? How far will we allow neuroscience to go? It is time to make up our minds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-elephant-in-the-brain-9780190495992&quot;&gt;The Elephant in the Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Kevin Simler and Robin Hanson &lt;img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EOGhBuYI0KI-145x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;145&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our brains are designed not just to hunt and gather, but also to help us get ahead socially, often via deception and self-deception. But while we may be self-interested schemers, we benefit by pretending otherwise. The less we know about our own ugly motives, the better – and thus we don’t like to talk or even think about the extent of our selfishness. This is “the elephant in the brain.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/your-brain-on-food-9780190932794&quot;&gt;Your Brain on Food, Third Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Gary L. Wenk &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This essential book vividly demonstrates how a little knowledge about the foods and drugs we eat can teach us a lot about how our brain functions. The intersection between brain science, drugs, food and our cultural and religious traditions is plainly illustrated in an entirely new light. Wenk tackles fundamental and fascinating questions, such as: &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://medium.com/@OUPAcademic/feed-an-injured-brain-fad1cb8b729d&quot;&gt;Are some foods better to eat after brain injury&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These books showcase some fascinating areas of brain research. But we’ve still got a long way to go before most of our questions about this intricate organ are answered. A comprehensive understanding of the brain is especially critical to combating public health issues, including rising rates of dementia and psychiatric disorders. As such, the continuing progress of brain research will be beneficial to us all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured Image Credit: Owned by Oxford University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/seven-books-on-the-fascinating-human-brain-reading-list/&quot;&gt;Seven books on the fascinating human brain [reading list]&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/619898700/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/619898700/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fENihhJkDjS0-143x220.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/619898700/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-olive-oil-promotes-brain-health/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How olive oil promotes brain health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/a-guide-to-parent-self-care-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A guide to parent self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-we-can-equip-ourselves-against-climate-change/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How we can equip ourselves against climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of things you can do in a five minute break at work — talk to a colleague, make a cup of tea or coffee, or even go outside for some fresh air. But with the advent of digital technology, many of us now spend the short lulls in our day doing something else: looking at our phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has already suggested (fairly unsurprisingly) that smartphone use increases as we get more bored or fatigued. It makes sense: if you’re doing a particularly tedious task at work, you’re much more likely to want to spend a few minutes scrolling on your phone than if you’re doing something deeply engaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But does looking at your phone actually &lt;em&gt;relieve&lt;/em&gt; boredom? A new study from Jonas Dora and colleagues at Radboud University, available as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/uy8rs&quot;&gt;preprint at &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/uy8rs&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PsyArXiv&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, seems to suggest not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39336&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t immediately clear whether smartphone use would increase or decrease fatigue and boredom. On one hand, previous research suggests that notifications significantly impact people’s ability to concentrate on major tasks; on the other, looking at your phone could provide what the authors refer to as a “microbreak”, allowing a small period in which to recover from the demands (and boredoms) of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore this relationship further, the team asked 83 participants to rate their level of fatigue and boredom every hour they were at work for three working days. An app had also been installed on their phones, which monitored smartphone use during the twenty minutes before and twenty minutes after these self-reports (times that overlapped with the start of end of work, or with lunch breaks, were omitted from analysis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone breaks were extremely frequent: in the twenty minutes following each questionnaire, participants picked up their phone 52% of the time, spending an average of around ninety seconds on it each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As participants’ fatigue and boredom increased, so too did the frequency with which they looked at their phones. For instance,  a ten-point increase in boredom, on a 100-point scale, resulted in a 40% higher likelihood someone would reach for their phone (though there was no evidence that they spent any &lt;em&gt;longer &lt;/em&gt;looking at their smartphones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So did participants feel less bored after picking up their phones? Surprisingly, this wasn’t the case. Researchers looked at fatigue levels twenty minutes before self-reports, finding participants actually reported &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; levels of boredom after having used their smartphones (though the effect size was admittedly small — a single digit increase on the 100-point scale).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two reasons why this might be the case. Switching between tasks — even between a boring task and an enriching one — can carry a cognitive load of its own, with the reward of a brief glance at a phone not enough to make up the deficit. And rather than being a motivating break, looking at a phone may simply underline the gap between the things you find taxing and the things you find invigorating — thus making you even more fed up and bored when you return to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research had a small sample size, so it’s important not to draw too many definitive conclusions from its findings. But it’s not the only study to find a negative relationship between smartphone use and boredom levels. One &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/03/11/put-it-away-spending-work-breaks-on-your-smartphone-is-not-rejuvenating/&quot;&gt;2016 paper&lt;/a&gt; found that spending work breaks on the phone can lead to decreased levels of motivation: because you’re not allowing your mind to wander when you look at your phone, it suggested, you’re not getting any of the benefits you normally would during a break from work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next time you’re bored and feel yourself reaching for your smartphone, it might be an idea to resist it. Leaving your desk or even just looking out of the window for five minutes may be less compelling than what’s on your newsfeed — but you may find yourself less tired, less bored and less demotivated in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://psyarxiv.com/uy8rs&quot;&gt;Fatigue, boredom, and objectively-measured smartphone use at work&lt;/a&gt; [this paper is a preprint, meaning that it has not yet been subjected to peer review and the final published version may differ from the version this report was based on]&lt;/p&gt;

 Last year, JAMA Ophthalmology published a study that claimed to find a link between using cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins and a reduced risk of glaucoma. In a New York Times story on the paper, lead author Jae H. Kang, an assistant professor of medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, suggested that statins … &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2020/03/16/statins-may-cut-glaucoma-risk-said-a-ny-times-headline-turns-out-thats-not-true/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;“Statins May Cut Glaucoma Risk,” said a New York Times headline.

		<title type="html">A Vim script function to select signatures in Neomutt</title>
		<link href="http://ankursinha.in/2020/03/15/a-vimscript-function-to-select-signatures-in-neomutt.html"/>
		<id>tag:ankursinha.in,2020-03-15:/2020/03/15/a-vimscript-function-to-select-signatures-in-neomutt.html</id>
		<updated>2020-03-15T09:39:20+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;I've been using &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neomutt.org/&quot;&gt;Neomutt&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://ankursinha.in/2017/12/16/transitioning-to-neomutt-and-friends-for-e-mail.html&quot;&gt;while now&lt;/a&gt;.
It allows me to stick to the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.byobu.org/&quot;&gt;Byobu&lt;/a&gt; based terminal workflow that I'm used to.
Most importantly, it lets me use &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vim.org/&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; to write my e-mails, so I don't need to
really learn another tool now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neomutt.org/&quot;&gt;Neomutt&lt;/a&gt; can be configured to add a signature at the end of the e-mail, and one
can select a signature depending on various parameters, such as the senders
address using &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://neomutt.org/man/neomuttrc&quot;&gt;hooks&lt;/a&gt;. However,
sometimes, one does need to select other signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vim.org/&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; way, of course, is to simply delete the last few lines, and
then read in the new signature using &lt;code&gt;:r &amp;lt;filename&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This takes a few
more key strokes than one would like (well, than I like) so I thought I'd
dabble in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)#Vim_script&quot;&gt;Vim script&lt;/a&gt; a bit and automate it. Here's what I've come up with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code vim literal-block&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&quot; A function to load the right signature when I'm using neomutt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; LoadSignature&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;signature&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;    &quot; Only work for mail files&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; this_file_type &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;filetype&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; this_file_type &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;mail&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        echo &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;This is not a mail file! Not running!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;endif&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
    &quot; Get the current signature's line&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;    &quot; Go to last line&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; saved_cursor_position &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; getpos&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;    &quot; Set cursor to file end and search backwards&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; cursor&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;99999999999999999999&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;:sigstart &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; search&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'-- '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;    &quot; Confirm that the line was found&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; sigstart &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
        echo &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;No signatures detected.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;endif&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
    &quot; Check if signature file exists&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;:sigdir &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; escape&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;expand&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'$HOME'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'\'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; . &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/Sync/99_private/neomuttdir/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;:sigfile &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; sigdir . &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;:signature . &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;.sig&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; filereadable&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sigfile&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;        &quot; delete the current lines after the &quot;-- &quot; line&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;:delstart &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; sigstart &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
        execute delstart . &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;,$d&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;        &quot; Read the new signature&lt;/span&gt;
        execute sigstart . &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;read &quot;&lt;/span&gt; . sigfile
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;        &quot; Return cursor to wherever it was&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; setpos&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; saved_cursor_position&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
        echo &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;File &quot;&lt;/span&gt; . sigfile . &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot; not found!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        echo &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Available signature files:\n&quot;&lt;/span&gt; . globpath&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sigdir&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'*.sig'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;endif&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;endfunction&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, adding this to &lt;code&gt;~/.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; would let one run &lt;code&gt;:call
LoadSignature('signature')&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vim.org/&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; to select a signature. Each signature is a
different file with a &lt;code&gt;.sig&lt;/code&gt; file extension in the location given by
&lt;code&gt;sigdir&lt;/code&gt;, and the name of the file is the argument that needs to be given
to the function. If the signature file cannot be found, it'll list available ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's quite simple really, and I'm sure it can be made better, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Despite tantalising headlines and claims from tech companies, we’re a long way from having computers that can read our minds&lt;/strong&gt;. At &lt;em&gt;WIRED&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/brain-computer-interfaces&quot;&gt;Nicole Kobie looks at the more immediate potential of brain-computer interfaces&lt;/a&gt;: giving a voice to paralysed people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39329&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A world-wide survey of dog owners has investigated how common anxiety-related behaviours are in different breeds&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/your-dog-anxious-genes-common-its-breed-could-play-role&quot;&gt;reports Michael Price&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. About a third of all dogs displayed noise sensitivity (e.g. during fireworks and thunder), and many were scared of other dogs, strangers or new situations. But the pattern of anxiety varied between breeds: Labradors were barely ever wary of strangers, for instance, while Lagotto Romagnolos were particularly scared of loud noises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does stress affect our brains — and what can you do to tackle it?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/how-chronic-stress-changes-the-brain-and-what-you-can-do-to-reverse-the-damage-133194&quot;&gt;Barbara Sahakian, Christelle Langley and Muzaffer Kaser have the answers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lacking the words to describe an experience can leave us blind to its occurrence: this is known as a state of “hypocognition”,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/ideas/hypocognition-is-a-censorship-tool-that-mutes-what-we-can-feel&quot;&gt;writes Kaidi Wu&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Aeon&lt;/em&gt;. But as we learn or develop new language and wrap our heads around new concepts, Wu writes, we “give meaning to walks of life previously starved of recognition”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also at &lt;em&gt;Aeon&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/ideas/testosterone-is-widely-and-sometimes-wildly-misunderstood&quot;&gt;Matthew Gutmann breaks down some of the myths&lt;/a&gt; about testosterone&lt;/strong&gt;, writing that early studies on the effects of testosterone were fatally flawed — and that the hormone has been used at times as an excuse for men’s behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The culture we live in is undoubtedly a huge force on the kinds of decisions that we make in our lives&lt;/strong&gt;. But other factors like advertising and the media have less of an impact than you might think, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/free-thought-can-you-ever-be-a-truly-independent-thinker-129033&quot;&gt;writes Tom Stafford&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just a short round-up today, as most coverage this week understandably focuses on the coronavirus pandemic. Don’t forget that the team over at &lt;em&gt;The Psychologist &lt;/em&gt;have published a collection of articles considering the virus from a psychological perspective, and are also compiling links to other stories from around the web.&lt;/strong&gt;  You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-33/april-2020/coronavirus-psychological-perspectives&quot;&gt;read the growing resource here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 On the surface, it would seem like a good thing when science undergirds policy decisions. But what if that science is deeply flawed?

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-CA">
 &lt;p&gt;As the global impact of COVID-19 becomes apparent, we write to share updates relevant to the arXiv community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, arXiv is unaffected by the outbreak and continues to operate as usual. Our intention is to maintain the same speed and service that our community values so deeply. As arXiv’s scientific director Steinn Sigurdsson said, “With quarantines and major conferences being cancelled, arXiv will be as important as ever to sharing research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we acknowledge that our team is global, and the situation is evolving rapidly. Our highest priority is the health and safety of our community, and we recognize that staff and volunteer moderators may need to take time off to address their personal well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we plan to keep papers flowing as much as possible, we need to accept that delays might happen. We hope that by keeping open communication among moderators, staff, and users, we can avoid any major disruptions. If your paper is delayed, we graciously ask for your patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, we’ve added a&lt;a href=&quot;https://status.arxiv.org&quot;&gt; status page&lt;/a&gt; that will allow anyone to monitor and subscribe to updates around arXiv’s operational status, including planned maintenance, unscheduled outages, and other events that may affect the availability of arXiv services. More information about the status page is available on our recent&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2020/03/02/communicating-arxivs-operational-status/&quot;&gt; blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience and understanding during this complicated moment.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Today, PLOS joins a list of endorsers of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openpharma.blog/position-statement-on-open-access/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Position Statement on Open Access&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; coordinated by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openpharma.blog/about-us/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Open Pharma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, a group of pharmaceutical clients, publishers, patients, academics, regulators, editors, non-pharmaceutical funders, and societies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS is a fully Open Access publisher, with all content published with a CC-BY license. We are  therefore ready to support the aims of Open Pharma without delay or need to alter policies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We support any and all moves to open science, and to improve the integrity of research. The pharmaceutical industry &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openpharma.blog/position-statement-on-open-access/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;funds roughly half&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; of all biomedical research, yet has been slower to adopt the Open Access and Open Science policies that are now becoming mainstream. Our hope, by endorsing this position statement, is to ensure the pharmaceutical industry understands it is just as welcome and able to submit to PLOS journals as any other research group. Our robust editorial policies, open data policy, and Open Science mission will help the industry validate and demonstrate the credibility of its work. We look forward to continued collaboration to improve medical science and patient care. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s been a lot of back and forth about the psychological effects of taking and sharing selfies. Some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30149282&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that taking pictures of yourself can dent your self-esteem and increase anxiety, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/EJM-07-2015-0512/full/html&quot;&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that selfies can be a source of empowerment; one &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/23/taking-a-selfie-could-dent-your-self-esteem-unless-you-share-it/&quot;&gt;2017 paper&lt;/a&gt; even found a combination of the two, suggesting that sharing selfies online can mitigate the damage to self-image often inflicted when a selfie is actually taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hundreds of op-eds, articles and TV features that continue to focus on the issue also suggest that our interest in the phenomenon is unlikely to abate any time soon. And now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17482798.2019.1697319&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Children and Media&lt;/em&gt; has added to the debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It suggests that &lt;em&gt;taking&lt;/em&gt; selfies may not be as damaging as other research has claimed. Instead, it’s what you do after you’ve taken the photo that matters: it’s editing images that really hurts our self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39322&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Larissa Terán and colleagues at the University of Arizona first asked 278 teenage girls, aged 14 to 17, about their selfie activities. Participants rated how frequently they share selfies, and were then asked how often they edited their pictures using various different tools (e.g. getting rid of red eye, smoothing skin or making themselves look thinner using editing apps). They were then asked about selfie investment: how much effort and time they spent choosing photos of themselves to post online, as well as how concerned they were about the reception these posts receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, a questionnaire looked at self-objectification, a phenomenon in which people view themselves as objects rather than human beings. Participants were asked to select how much they identified with statements including “looking attractive to others is more important to me than being happy with who I am” and “I try to imagine what my body looks like to others”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were then given questions on appearance anxiety, rating how tense they feel when people look at them or when they feel they are being negatively perceived, as well as questions on how ashamed they feel about their appearance and on how they would evaluate their own looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As hypothesised, those who spent more time editing, thinking and worrying about selfies were more likely to see themselves as objects than those who did not. This self-objectification, in turn, was linked to greater anxiety and body shame amongst participants, and worse evaluation of their own looks. That is, people who invested more into thinking about or editing selfies tended to have more negative feelings about their own body — and that seemed to be because they were prone to self-objectification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough — and as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/23/taking-a-selfie-could-dent-your-self-esteem-unless-you-share-it/&quot;&gt;2017 paper&lt;/a&gt; also suggested — &lt;em&gt;sharing&lt;/em&gt; selfies more frequently was not significantly associated with greater self-objectification nor with increased levels of body shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors have several suggestions as to why simply sharing selfies wasn’t related to negative body image. Pictures may not always be shared with appearance in mind: sometimes teens want to demonstrate who they’re friends with, what they’re interested in or what they’ve been doing. In fact, the team found some evidence that greater selfie sharing was linked to &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; self-image — meaning posting pictures of oneself might actually &lt;em&gt;decrease&lt;/em&gt; shame about looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether there is actually a causal relationship between these factors, however, is not so clear. It could be that editing selfies contributes to concerns about appearance — that the process of editing, in other words, actively increases body shame. But there is also a distinct possibility that those who &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; have negative body image are more likely to edit pictures in the first place: their self-esteem is already wavering or low, so they feel the need to edit out hated flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the results truly are reflective of how teenage girls perceive their selfie taking activities, it may be more accurate to say that the &lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt; in which selfies are taken and shared are more important than anything inherent to the act itself. So rather than condemning teenage girls for taking selfies — or banning them from taking them, if you’re a parent — it may be more useful to understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they’re doing it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/World-Kidney-day-2020-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 850 million people worldwide.  This global health burden continues to increase each year.  There are no symptoms in early CKD.  It is not until CKD has progressed to the point of needing dialysis that patients develop recognizable symptoms.  This means that it is vital that patients are screened for CKD, since early diagnosis can prevent the progression of kidney disease.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldkidneyday.org/2020-campaign/2020-wkd-theme/&quot;&gt;World Kidney Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on 12th March 2020 will focus on &lt;strong&gt;“Kidney Health for Everyone Everywhere – from Prevention to Detection and Equitable Access to Care”&lt;/strong&gt;.  Primary care providers (PCPs) are on the frontline against CKD progression by making the early diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-01731-x&quot;&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; by Neale &lt;em&gt;et al., &lt;/em&gt;published today in &lt;em&gt;BMC Nephrology,&lt;/em&gt; evaluated the barriers and enablers to the diagnosis and management of CKD in primary care.  Most reviews focus on barriers&lt;em&gt; or&lt;/em&gt; enablers but this article was able to address both, which go hand-in-hand in helping PCPs tackle the growing health burden of CKD.  Twenty studies were included in the review. The most common barriers identified were lack of time, fear of delivering the CKD diagnosis, and dissatisfaction with CKD guidelines.  The most common enablers were the presence of supportive technology to identify and manage CKD and collaborative relationships among members of the healthcare team. These and some other identified barriers and enablers from Neale &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;are listed in table 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11768&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11768 size-large&quot; height=&quot;345&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Worl-Kidney-Day-Blog_Table1-1-1024x552.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 1: Management and Detection of CKD in Primary Healthcare.  The most common are highlighted orange. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategies to Enhance Early Detection and Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare professionals frequently complain of the inadequate amount of time they can spend with patients. However, PCPs have one of the highest workloads, managing preventative care, acute complaints, multiple co-morbidities, etc.  Developing strategies to streamline the identification and management of CKD through electronic medical records and increasing the use of calculators for estimated GFR and kidney failure risk would benefit PCPs.  In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/350/bmj.h176.full.pdf&quot;&gt;adopting policies&lt;/a&gt; that enable longer consultations for complex patients will allow protected time to deal with the management of chronic diseases like CKD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective co-management of patients with CKD between PCPs and nephrologists is recognized as a key strategy to deliver high-quality CKD care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving CKD knowledge and confidence in diagnosis will empower PCPs to provide early diagnosis.  If patients know they have CKD in the primary care setting, they can take steps to increase their own CKD knowledge and self-management of CKD, promoting future favorable outcomes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0272638614010610?token=595049B828280D60DE74EE3A6F2A4F0DFFA62F5357753C421BE25E03C6210DA1999D18113CA869B6495D8EF3AB581D07&quot;&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; implemented a toolkit to enhance awareness of CKD among PCPs.  This quality improvement activity led to greater identification of CKD, increased referral to nephrology, increased communication among PCPs and nephrologists, and the development of co-management plans. Toolkits like this one should be used more frequently for providing continuing education and resources for our PCPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidelines rarely deal with comorbidities, but practice guidelines that consider the co-morbid nature of CKD would increase understanding and use among PCPs.  It will help with prioritizing the patient’s problem list and management strategies.  One potential solution is to develop guidelines that consider common clusters of chronic conditions. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.european-renal-best-practice.org/content/erbp-documents-topic&quot;&gt;ERBP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kdigo.org/guidelines/&quot;&gt;KDIGO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kidney.org/professionals/guidelines/guidelines_commentaries&quot;&gt;KDOQI&lt;/a&gt; have already started to address this by providing guidelines on CKD and co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hepatitis C, and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11606-019-04975-y.pdf&quot;&gt;Effective co-management of patients&lt;/a&gt; with CKD between PCPs and nephrologists is recognized as a key strategy to deliver high-quality CKD care.  Interventions facilitating the exchange of information, clear delineation of roles/responsibilities, and greater access to specialist advice improve the co-management of patients with CKD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCPs and nephrologists working together in a multi-disciplinary team to care of these complex patients can only lead to future healthcare benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Ohki Katakura will talk about the paper &quot;Spatiotemporal network coding of physiological mossy fiber inputs by the cerebellar granular layer&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The granular layer, which mainly consists of granule and Golgi cells, is the first stage of the cerebellar cortex and processes spatiotemporal information transmitted by mossy fiber inputs with a wide variety of firing patterns. To study its dynamics at multiple time scales in response to inputs approximating real spatiotemporal patterns, we constructed a large-scale 3D network model of the granular layer. Patterned mossy fiber activity induces rhythmic Golgi cell activity that is synchronized by shared parallel fiber input and by gap junctions. This leads to long distance synchrony of Golgi cells along the transverse axis, powerfully regulating granule cell firing by imposing inhibition during a specific time window. The essential network mechanisms, including tunable Golgi cell oscillations, on-beam inhibition and NMDA receptors causing first winner keeps winning of granule cells, illustrate how fundamental properties of the granule layer operate in tandem to produce (1) well timed and spatially bound output, (2) a wide dynamic range of granule cell firing and (3) transient and coherent gating oscillations. These results substantially enrich our understanding of granule cell layer processing, which seems to promote spatial group selection of granule cell activity as a function of timing of mossy fiber input.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/11/gender-prejudice-is-more-common-in-languages-with-grammatical-genders/"/>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emmayoung.net/&quot;&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the language that you speak influence what you think? And do languages that assign a gender to most nouns — such as French and Spanish — lead speakers to feel differently about women versus men, compared with languages that don’t — such as Chinese? Both questions have been hotly debated. But now a major &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/pspa0000188&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, involving an analysis of millions of pages of text in 45 different languages from all over the world, concludes that gendered languages shape prejudice against women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-39315&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Gendered languages, such as French and Spanish, Russian and Hindi, dictate that most nouns are male or female. For example, “the ball” is&lt;em&gt; la pelota&lt;/em&gt; (female) in Spanish and &lt;em&gt;le ballon&lt;/em&gt; (male) in French. In these languages, adjectives and verbs also change slightly depending on the gender of the noun. Then there’s a group of “natural gender” languages, in which nouns aren’t gendered, but pronouns do reflect gender (such as &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; in English, which belongs to this group.) Finally, there are genderless languages, in which a pronoun can refer to either gender, such as Chinese and Finnish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier research has found that in countries where gendered languages are spoken, women earn lower wages and are less likely to succeed in politics. But researchers have questioned whether the nature of the language itself has anything to do with this. Perhaps, some have suggested, languages simply reflect differences in broader cultural attitudes to men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, David DeFranza and colleagues at the University of Utah used a technique called Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyse vast amounts of text taken from Wikipedia and the Common Crawl project, which holds snapshots of text taken from the internet since 2013, comprising more than 630 billion words. Text in 45 different languages, which include the first or second languages of more than half of the world’s population, were included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NLP software scanned these texts, looking for close co-occurrences of gender words (such as &lt;em&gt;woman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;hers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; in English) and positive or negative terms. The list of positive terms included &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;pleasure&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;lucky&lt;/em&gt;, for example, while the negative terms included &lt;em&gt;abuse&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sickness&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ugly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that the gendered languages were much more likely to show skewed associations, with more positive terms being associated with men than with women. For example, in the Commons Crawl component of the study, 19 of the 28 gendered languages used in this analysis — 67% — showed this pattern, whereas none of the 17 genderless languages did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various geographic, cultural and demographic factors have been shown to influence gender equality. But the team did control for various of these factors in their analysis (for example, they used data from the Global Gender Gap index developed by the World Economic Forum and the Human Development Index, developed by the UNDP), and the effect still held. “Using languages that span continents and cultures, we find evidence that gender prejudice exists more in gendered languages,” they conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further analysis used a similar method to explore gender stereotypes within these languages. The team found that in gendered, but not genderless, languages, male words, more than female words, were associated with being “competent”, “skilful” and “confident” (attributes traditionally associated more with men than women) but also “warm” (which traditionally has been associated more with women). In gendered languages, men are seen in a more positive light, overall, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What might explain this pro-male bias?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers speculate that as gendered languages personify even inanimate objects with a specific gender, the regular use of such terms could frequently, unconsciously reinforce implicit attitudes about men and women. So, if men are traditionally viewed in a more positive light, using masculine nouns could bring to mind the positive associations regarding masculinity and reinforce a pro-male bias. If this is how the effect works, then the broader attitudes of a culture are clearly important, but language type has its own role to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few limitations to the study. Most notably, this is an analysis of written text on the internet. Perhaps it doesn’t accurately reflect the attitudes of societies more broadly. However, this text was voluntarily produced by millions of people, and it’s debatable whether studies that involve asking people what they think are better at revealing actual beliefs. Indeed, the researchers argue that their work shows the value of analysing the extraordinary amounts of text held in Wikipedia and Common Crawl for research in social psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future studies could explore whether other stereotypes, not considered in this study — such as weakness vs power, home vs career, or perceptions of emotional versus rational decision-making — might show different patterns of gender association in gendered vs genderless languages, the team suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A case of genetic testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samila* had been suffering from shortness of breath and exhaustion when, at the age of 19, she was diagnosed with a heart that did not pump properly. Attempting to understand what caused this condition, her cardiologist suggested genetic testing. The test showed no underlying genetic factors for her heart issues and her medication was so effective that Samila thought it all might have been a fluke. However, when she was 26, her cardiologist unexpectedly contacted her with some upsetting information: part of her DNA had been identified as being involved in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Fictionalized case&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genetic testing: uncertainty amidst possible expectations of certainty &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A genetic test inspects parts or even the entirety of the genome, which contains all our hereditary information encoded in the DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of human genetics studies the workings of human genomes and how variations within it might play a role in the development of medical conditions. Through these studies, our genes can offer us important insights into why we have developed certain conditions, whether we could develop them in the future, and whether our children are at increased risk of developing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We frequently attribute a great deal of certainty to genetic testing and the information it produces in terms of what it can tell us regarding current and future health risks. However, for all our expectations, the connection between our genes and discuss our health is anything but clear-cut. The information provided by genetic testing often contains a multitude of uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such uncertainty is that the meaning of genetic information can change over time. Depending on the moment a genetic test is performed or its data interpreted, patients may receive different results. This can be unsettling for patients and pose a real challenge to genetic professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stable genomes, changing understandings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People change, their genomes do not. Our genome is inherited at conception and generally stays constant beyond the day we die. Patients like Samila may, therefore, wonder why they receive new genetic information many years later after their DNA was initially “cleared”. Despite its fixed nature, our understanding and interpretation of the genome is anything but stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing enables us to inspect an individual genome for variations that differ from a template (i.e. ‘the’ human reference genome). Everyone has millions of variations that differ from this reference, but most are harmless or even beneficial. For patients, then, we need to establish whether these variations can explain or predict conditions or whether they are innocent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11758&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Suspect gene&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11758 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;198&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Fig-1-300x198.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Professionals in human genetics might be likened to molecular detectives. &lt;em&gt;Illustration by Julia El Mecky.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, geneticists are kind of molecular detectives. They uncover evidence in order to ascertain whether their “suspects” – i.e. variations in an individual’s genome – are guilty or innocent regarding the development of specific conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complicating the task of reviewing evidence, like in an actual criminal investigation, is that new evidence might unfold as time passes. This new evidence may redefine how genetic variation might be involved in medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Samila’s case, for instance, it was uncertain if some of the initially identified genetic variation was harmless or suspicious. But as time went on, more patients with the same condition appeared to have this genetic variation, which indeed could be associated with cardiomyopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New evidence: important implications for patients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11759&quot; style=&quot;width: 270px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Guilty gene&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-11759 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Fig-2-260x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;260&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;New evidence can change the “verdict” that is given to genetic variation. &lt;em&gt;Illustration by Julia El Mecky&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolving genetic evidence can have significant implications for patients and their relatives in terms of treatment decisions, medical protocols, and life decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Samila’s case, this new interpretation indicated a chronic heart condition that was likely to progress, irrespective of any treatment. Samila was advised to look for a job that was not too stressful. Her children have a 50% chance of having the genetic variation, putting them at higher risk of developing a similar condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Challenges for professionals in genetic healthcare&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New genetic technologies produce information regarding genetic variation at unprecedented rates, continuously providing new data on the relationship between genetic variation and medical conditions as time moves on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changing nature of genetic knowledge raises highly challenging questions for professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, a laboratory geneticist’s role is to interpret the meaning of genetic variation. What are their responsibilities with respect to identifying and providing up-to-date, important health information to individuals who have been tested in the past?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If laboratories would enact a policy of routinely inspecting all new evidence and update the interpretation of genetic data in their registry, patients such as Samila could receive vital medical information at an earlier time. Samila might then have considered measures to prevent her children from inheriting the genetic variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the workload for professionals to review massive amounts of new evidence is exorbitant and would strain resources, potentially cutting into time spent on other healthcare-related activities. Should the responsibility therefore lie with Samila or her primary care practitioner to regularly request updated interpretations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial that these issues are explored through research that includes the perspectives of those involved. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcmedgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12920-019-0612-6?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;looks at these questions in the context of the genetic laboratory. We invite everyone interested to read this paper, which raises important points of consideration for clinical genetics practice.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;Matthew Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When studying for exams, it can be tempting to just re-read textbooks or attempt to memorise your notes. But psychologists know that there are actually much more effective ways of learning — they just require a bit of extra effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acp.3639?af=R&quot;&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Applied Cognitive Psychology &lt;/em&gt;has highlighted two of these superior strategies. The team finds that university students whose revision involves testing themselves or making up questions about course material perform better in a later exam than those who simply restudy their notes.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39311&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past research had already shown that generating questions or &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/09/09/the-digest-guide-to-studying/&quot;&gt;being tested&lt;/a&gt; during the learning process helps people retain information better than passively trying to absorb knowledge. These strategies are considered “desirable difficulties” that make the learning process harder or more effortful, but which are ultimately beneficial. But many previous studies only examined people’s ability to learn in the lab, or had tested them very soon after the learning phase. In real life, of course, people learn in places like schools and universities, and tests may occur days or weeks after studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Mirjam Ebersbach and colleagues from the University of Kassel decided to test the effectiveness of these strategies in an actual educational context. The team recruited 82 German university students in a developmental psychology lecture and assigned them to one of three conditions. All three groups were given a print-out of 10 slides from the lecture (which was about the development of knowledge in infants), but each group studied the material in different ways. The “restudy” group was told to simply memorise the content of each slide. The “testing” group was given a question for each slide which they had to answer (they were allowed to look at the content in the slides if they weren’t able to answer initially). Finally, the “generating questions” group had to come up with test questions themselves, based on the content of each slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later, participants were given a surprise exam based on the information they had studied. Students had to answer five factual questions that directly related to the content they had learned, as well as five “transfer” questions, in which they had to apply the knowledge to new contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, participants who had only restudied the material scored a little under 45% on the test. By contrast, those who had answered or generated questions during the learning phase scored 11 percentage points higher, on average. Both of these strategies were significantly better than restudying, but neither was better than the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the researchers analysed scores on the factual and transfer questions separately, they found some preliminary evidence that the two methods produced better results than restudying for both kinds of question. This suggests that the strategies help people to not only learn facts, but also apply that knowledge to new contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the study has some important limitations. Most notably, the sample size was very small — groups ranged from 22 to 30 participants — so it will be important to replicate the findings in larger samples. And, as the researchers point out, their participants were all university students and so were presumably fairly good learners, or at least had plenty of experience studying and sitting exams. It remains to be seen whether these strategies are just as helpful in real-life situations for younger people or those who face greater difficulty absorbing new information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the results have clear applications for those looking to boost their learning. “Our results suggest that the two learning strategies, which are both clearly more effective than simple restudying, can be recommended by (university) teachers to learners and can also be recommended for (self-regulated) learning,” the authors conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acp.3639?af=R&quot;&gt;Comparing the effects of generating questions, testing, and restudying on students’ long-term recall in university learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrolling through Facebook or Instagram, it can be easy to feel drawn in by the people you follow. Whether it’s the brands they’re buying, the things they’re doing or what they’re wearing, it’s not uncommon to want to follow suit — they’re called “influencers” for a reason, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t only true of those who are paid to influence, however: those we know in “real life” and follow on social media can also impact the decisions we make. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666319310359?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Appetite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Lily Hawkins and colleagues at Aston University find that what we think our online friends are eating can influence how healthy (or not) our own diets are.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39305&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team asked 369 university students to fill in a survey about their perceptions of Facebook users’ food habits and preferences — how many servings of vegetables they believed an average Facebook user to eat every day, for example — and what they felt users’ food habits &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be. They were also asked to rate how much they identified with the label of “Facebook user” themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, a set of questions explored participants’ own eating styles: how able they feel to restrain themselves around food, how emotional their eating tends to be, and how often they engage in uncontrolled eating. They also filled in a food frequency questionnaire, which measured how often they ate various food types, and reported how many servings of fruit, vegetables and snacks they usually consumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the participants answered questions on their mood and appetite whilst completing the study, and on lifestyle factors like BMI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that perceived norms amongst Facebook users did in fact predict how often participants ate fruit and vegetables. The more participants felt their Facebook friends were eating fruit and veg, the more they ate themselves. Meanwhile, participants’ consumption of unhealthy snacks and sugary drinks was influenced by how much they thought Facebook users &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; eat junk food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much Facebook users were perceived to &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; a particular food did not have a significant effect, however; participants’ own habits were only influenced by what they believed users were actually consuming, or should be consuming. That is, people tended to match whatever pattern of consumption they felt to be the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though our eating habits may be affected by perceptions of how other people are eating, the impact on our actual health may be limited: these perceptions were not linked to differences in participants’ BMI, a factor the team hopes to follow up on longer term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that online friends influence our lives so directly is compelling, but there were some notable limitations to the study. Firstly, only &lt;em&gt;perceived&lt;/em&gt; norms were measured. What participants were actually seeing when they logged onto Facebook was ignored, but may prove to have an impact on what they were eating. And only 81% of participants were actually on Facebook — 19% didn’t have an account, so their perceptions of the average Facebook user may have missed the mark entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the study provides some insights into how perceptions of online norms influence the way we ourselves eat. It seems to differ depending on what’s being eaten. Healthy eating appears to be guided by other people’s behaviour, while our consumption of unhealthy foods is related to how likely we feel to be judged for our consumption — an effect that can be particularly potent online, the team suggests, where many of us feel a need for social acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also suggests that social media could be used as a tool to “nudge” people into more healthy behaviours — potentially a useful public health intervention when it comes to encouraging healthy diets. But ensuring these nudges encourage positive behaviour, rather than shaming those who are more unhealthy, could be a factor worth further attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666319310359?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;Do perceived norms of social media users’ eating habits and preferences predict our own food consumption and BMI?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychology news seems to be taking a backseat in the media this week as concerns about coronavirus mount around the world. &lt;/strong&gt;But psychologists also have much to contribute when it comes to understanding the current crisis and our responses to it.&lt;span id=&quot;more-39301&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;em&gt;BBC Future&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200304-coronavirus-covid-19-update-why-people-are-stockpiling&quot;&gt;Bryan Lufkin examines the reasons that people panic buy&lt;/a&gt;, a phenomenon that is leaving some supermarket shelves empty and making it harder for healthcare professionals to get goods they need, such as face masks. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/06/dont-let-coronavirus-tip-society-into-panic-say-psychologists&quot;&gt;psychologists are urging authorities to prevent further anxiety and panic&lt;/a&gt; by providing clear information and accounting for “herd behaviour”, Hannah Devlin reports in &lt;em&gt;The Guardian.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been told to stop touching our faces — but although it seems like a simple preventative action, it turns out to be much easier said than done. At &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/health/stop-touching-your-face.html&quot;&gt;Jenny Gross talks to psychologists and other academics&lt;/a&gt; about some of the ways to stop the habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, Daniel Jolley and Pia Lamberty &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-is-a-breeding-ground-for-conspiracy-theories-heres-why-thats-a-serious-problem-132489&quot;&gt;explore why conspiracy theories tend to appear at times of crisis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally over at &lt;em&gt;The Psychologist&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/coronavirus-psychological-perspectives&quot;&gt;the team are compiling psychological perspectives&lt;/a&gt; on coronavirus. The page is being regularly updated, so keep an eye out for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In more uplifting news, scientists have found that humans are not the only creatures able to use statistical information to make decisions: so can kea, the mischievous alpine parrots native to New Zealand,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/new-zealand-birds-show-humanlike-ability-make-predictions&quot;&gt;reports Virginia Morell&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.  Researchers first taught kea that a black token was associated with food. They then showed the kea two transparent jars containing black and orange tokens, and removed a token from each with a closed hand. The kea tended to pick whichever hand had taken a token from the jar with the greater proportion of black to orange tokens, suggesting that they had used this statistical information to figure out which hand offered the best chance of getting a food reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to write a hit song, make sure to use the word “you” in it a lot. &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have found that songs that make it higher up the charts have a greater proportion of “you”s in them, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/people-like-songs-about-you&quot;&gt;writes Neuroskeptic&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/em&gt;. The team thinks this may be because hearing about “you” helps listeners to imagine the story of the song applying to someone in their own lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The United Nations has released a new report on social norms regarding &lt;/b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gender&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, finding that almost 90% of people around the world show some level of prejudice against women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Interviewees were asked to respond to seven statements like “Men make better political leaders than women do” and “University is more important for a man than for a woman”. Only 10% of men and 14% of women showed no bias against women on any of these measures, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1812802/un-study-finds-almost-90-of-men-and-women-are-biased-against-women/&quot;&gt;reports Annalisa Merelli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quartz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, the American Psychological Association has reaffirmed that playing violent video games is not linked to an increase in real-life violence&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/apa-warns-against-linking-violent-video-games-to-real-world-violence/&quot;&gt;reports Kyle Orland&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;. However, the APA’s guidance also states that violent video games &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; related to small increases in aggressive behaviour, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/patmarkey/status/1235215442848997377?s=20&quot;&gt;some psychologists debate&lt;/a&gt;. Amongst other factors, they point to recent null findings in preregistered studies — such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/06/these-violent-delights-dont-have-violent-ends-study-finds-no-link-between-violent-video-games-and-teen-aggression/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; we covered last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compiled by Matthew Warren (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattbwarren&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@MattbWarren&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), Editor of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/&quot;&gt;BPS Research Digest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/19432_text_animation_re-size-150x150.gif&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We’re excited to share a new logo and a new “look” for PLOS! The new visuals you’ll see are a reflection of a broader set of important changes happening here over the past few years. This post gives a little bit of context about the “why” behind this work (and for the design nerds  more keenly interested in the background and some of our process… this is for you!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;So much has changed… but our “look” hadn’t. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Scientific communication has changed since PLOS’ original founding (transforming it has been our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plos.org/about/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; from the very beginning). Open Access is no longer a new idea. And while PLOS remains one of the original pioneers of OA in the global north, Open Access itself is increasingly mainstream. Yet, our look, feel, and color palette has been static for 7+years. And the PLOS “globe” logo had been essentially unchanged since our founding in 2003. (That’s a long time!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Developing a “look” true to PLOS’ roots, while truly visually new, felt daunting at times. Could we develop a visual brand reflective of the trust our communities place in us that ALSO shows our energy and willingness to break boundaries along the way? Can we capture both our expertise AND daring? And could our “look” channel the passion and excitement we experience daily in our work with researchers all over the world?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We knew we wanted to maintain a connection between the old and new. This work hasn’t been about starting from scratch but about moving forward. Here’s a peek behind the scenes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The design process&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We were voracious in seeking out inspiration, resulting in many, many storyboards from our incredibly talented in-house designer (more about her later…). While we’d love to share all her research, here’s a snapshot of some of our favorite themes: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=old+space+posters&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiIlPy_6PLnAhVHh60KHbbgDPwQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;amp;oq=old+space+posters&amp;amp;gs_l=img.12...0.0..21020...0.0..0.0.0.......0......gws-wiz-img.188YLLhhl_Y&amp;amp;ei=b0dYXsigBseOtgW2wbPgDw&amp;amp;bih=930&amp;amp;biw=1557&amp;amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS887&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vintage space posters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Beautiful on their own, these also call back to the original PLOS “globe”. Please click on that link to see a range of examples!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bold use of color: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Building on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;new &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;bold color palette&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; (launched in 2018) our new approach to color gives us a daring and different, yet professional look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/color-on-color.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-9096 size-large&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/color-on-color-1024x540.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use of overlapping shapes: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We’ve created interesting details by zooming in and out; layering colors and transparencies; and creating new, more complex shapes by overlapping simpler ones. This was inspired by our intersecting communities and the multiple ways we work with them!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/PLOS-rebrand-overlapping-shapes-images.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9097&quot; height=&quot;278&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/PLOS-rebrand-overlapping-shapes-images-1024x278.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;And here’s our logo’s journey, with the final result!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/logo-journey.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9098&quot; height=&quot;192&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/logo-journey-1024x192.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We hope you like the final result as much as we do. Take a look around &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plos.org&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;www.plos.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and you’ll see our inspiration in action. Today’s launch is the beginning. Over the coming weeks and months, you’ll see all PLOS visuals and collateral evolve in line with this new direction!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are incredibly lucky to have such creative talent within our team at PLOS — none of this process was outsourced to a design agency. The entire PLOS rebrand was researched and developed by our Senior Manager for Marketing Creative, Masami Overstreet. The website development, migration, and redesign incorporating the rebrand, was carried out by Ian Hamilton of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.colorcrate.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;ColorCrate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. Thanks to them, and everyone else involved in this refresh. And, thank YOU for reading!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About PLOS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;PLOS is a nonprofit, Open Access publisher empowering researchers to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication. We’ve been breaking boundaries since our founding in 2001. PLOS journals propelled the movement for OA alternatives to subscription journals. We established the first multi-disciplinary publication inclusive of all excellent research regardless of novelty or impact, and demonstrated the importance of open data availability. As Open Science advances, we continue to experiment to provide more opportunities, choice, and context for readers and researchers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/placenta-2433431_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost every animal on the planet which produces a placenta eats it after birth. There are only a few exceptions to this rule – aquatic animals, camels, and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, humans are so averse to eating our own placentas after birth that it has not been recorded by any culture anywhere in the world in all of human history. We have buried them, burned them and occasionally sold them as medicine to other people, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03670244.2010.524106?casa_token=FRqe63-3CvwAAAAA%3A8UeE7jzb_OoZFMOjR5MnZKqzSlvG2YrCDtoXn8r1cyYnXK-eA_RMtkOrxHGsOQXvEJa_c2T33oPU&quot;&gt;as far as we know&lt;/a&gt;, we have never routinely eaten our own. That is, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03670244.2012.719356?journalCode=gefn20&quot;&gt;until the 1970s&lt;/a&gt;, when the practice started spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Post-partum human maternal placentophagy” is the term for the phenomena of the birthing parent eating their own placenta after they have given birth. It is something which existing research indicates is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03670244.2012.719356?journalCode=gefn20&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;done almost exclusively by married, heterosexual, middle- or upper-class white women in the Global North&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to answer that question, we can look in the place where people are already talking about it: the internet. More specifically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-2824-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;our research&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, looked at threads posted on the UK parenting forums Mumsnet and Netmums and analysed them to see if common themes could be established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parenting forums can be important spaces for women to seek advice, including about placentophagy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we found was that people usually decide to eat their placentas because they either previously had, or felt they were at risk of, a negative experience during birth and the post-partum period. Most commonly, these were women who had existing mental health problems or had previously experienced post-natal depression (PND) and were worried about a recurrence. PND can be an awful, isolating and stigmatized condition and people were willing to seek a broad range of possible preventative measures – including eating their placenta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rationale for this is that in the immediate postpartum period, the birthing parent experiences a large and sudden drop in pregnancy-related hormones that can result in low mood and energy. The placenta produces a lot of those hormones and so re-ingesting it could replace some of them. The theory is that taking placenta in the form of an encapsulated pill once or twice a day over a period of time can mitigate some of that loss and therefore reduce or treat depression, induce lactation, boost mood, reduce cramps, improve energy and so on. According to existing research, there is no evidence that this is true (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1871519217302081?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;fairly good evidence&lt;/a&gt; that it has no impact on these things), but that does not stop the popularity of the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Popularity of placentophagy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few potential factors increasing this popularity. Nobody finds the idea of eating a placenta particularly appetizing. The practice of encapsulation (steaming and/or dehydrating, grinding up and placing the placenta into capsules) helps alleviate the potential unpleasantness, making the practice palatable to more people. This process costs somewhere between £100-400 to pay someone else to do. For those who are handy, there are DIY guides and kits that can be purchased online. Some may instead choose to mix the placenta with fruit in a smoothie, or consume it some other way, but encapsulation is by far the most popular method. The media attention on the topic has also helped push it into the public view and the internet is being used as a tool for sharing logistical information and overcoming potential barriers to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Placentophagy can be understood as a way of exerting control and managing fears around birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data we looked at also demonstrated that parenting forums can be important spaces for women to establish normative parenting values and seek advice, including about placentophagy. Whilst there were the expected jokes about it, there was also an emphasis on personal choice, bodily autonomy and the value of each other’s experiences to support those who had done or were considering the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivations and concerns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that placentophagy can be understood as being practiced as a way of exerting control and managing fears around birth and the birthing experience. It is medically legitimized through its similarity to medication and the sterile procedures used to create the “pills,” yet there is also an element of eschewing medical or scientific advice and seeking knowledge from people who have been in the same situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some understandable concerns about the practice. Seeking to address the issue oneself may cause a delay in seeking treatment for PND or other post-natal problems and there is a small concern about potential infection risk if the process is not sterile. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/birt.12354&quot;&gt;large medical records study in the USA&lt;/a&gt; found no evidence of adverse outcomes associated with the practice, which is reassuring, but may not be applicable to other countries where methods may vary subtly or significantly. When it is brought up in clinical practice, healthcare professionals should be able to non-judgmentally and openly discuss with pregnant people the available medical evidence, or lack thereof, for placentophagy. They should also explore the reasons why someone might be considering it and if there is any additional support they want or need.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-group&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-group__inner-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-jetpack-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you’re beginning to use Python daily. Great! You might still have a critical set of Matlab scripts from back in the day that doesn’t have a neat equivalent in Python. How do you rewrite this code in Python without introducing many headaches? I’ve had to do this a handful of times and have developed a method based on test-driven development that avoids the biggest issues in code translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define what you want to translate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a test plan based on existing code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write tests in Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the code in Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterate until tests pass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the method, I’ve migrated a script that I found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19709635&quot;&gt;Susillo and Abbott (2009)&lt;/a&gt;. It simulates a chaotic neural network and trains it with recursive least-squares. I wanted to make sure I would run into issues (gotchas!) when I translated the code to exercise the method – and I did run into issues! The method I’m outlining highlighted the translation bugs early and helped squash them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is part 3 of my guide on transitioning from Matlab to Python. Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/&quot;&gt;part 1: a curriculum to learn Python&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/&quot;&gt;part 2: choosing environments, IDEs and packages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pick your battles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algorithmic code that does matrix manipulation is typically a good candidate for translation into Python. Importantly, the code you will translate needs to currently run in Matlab, since we’re going to have to run the code and capture its current behaviour. &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/build-python-c-extension-module/&quot;&gt;Mex code can be repurposed pretty straightforwardly into a Python extension&lt;/a&gt;, keeping the core C numerics intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to avoid direct translation of code with dependencies on Simulink, GUIDE, or esoteric toolboxes. For GUIDE in particular, I’ve found that the limitations of GUIDE enforce a certain style of coding – lots of globals and convoluted logic. You’re probably better off rewriting the GUI code from scratch than attempting direct translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every piece of Matlab code needs to be translated to Python. If your goal is to archive an existing pipeline so it continues to run despite deprecation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile&quot;&gt;containerizing Matlab with Docker&lt;/a&gt; is a good route. You can also call legacy Matlab code from Python directly using the official Matlab engine for Python from Mathworks or using shell calls. However, some situations will &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; translating Matlab code, for instance, if you want to run your code in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, consider doing the process for a smaller project first. It’s not that easy! You will learn a lot from doing this once on a smaller scale. I recommend that you &lt;a href=&quot;https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/&quot;&gt;create a git repo for your project and commit regularly&lt;/a&gt;, because you might be doing a lot of iterations to get everything to run correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating a test-based strategy for rewriting the code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve identified a good script or function to rewrite. Should we start writing Python? No! It is very easy to rewrite code in another language that &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; to work, but has subtle bugs. You can spend days or weeks chasing down these bugs, and it will drive you crazy! For this reason, we will use a test-based strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capture what the behaviour of the code is &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt; for a variety of inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewrite the code in Python and make sure it does exactly the thing that we want it to do. That is, for the same inputs, it gives us the same outputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing&quot;&gt;We will create unit tests to verify the behaviour of our code is correct&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that it matches the old code exactly. At this point, you may say – &lt;em&gt;hold on, I don’t just want to transfer the code over, I want to improve it&lt;/em&gt;! Our goal is to capture the logic part of the code – the number-crunching. This does not stop us from improving the reference code in a number of ways, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making constants changeable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making the code more modular&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Pythonic data structures, for example using &lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt; to store time series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we have to build on a solid foundation – a reference. Once we replicate the original behaviour and commit it to a repo, we can improve it later in a new commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Identify inputs and outputs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to identify the inputs and outputs of the script or function we want to rewrite. One very nice thing about Matlab is that functions tend to be stateless and do not modify their arguments (unless an input is a reference object type, which is pretty rare). Thus, we can reason pretty easily about the inputs and the outputs to a function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The inputs are the arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The outputs are the return variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions may have side-effects, such as creating a plot or saving a file. A side-effect to a function is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)&quot;&gt;an observable effect besides returning a value (the main effect) to the invoker of the operation&lt;/a&gt;. If the code you’re translating has side-effects, you should aim to remove them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, consider a function takes in data and returns nothing, saving the results to disk, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-matlab&quot;&gt;function [] = mycomplexop(outfile)
    data = zeros(100, 100);
    % Complex things happen in the middle...
    save(outfile, 'data');
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can transform this into a side-effect-free function by returning the results instead of saving them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-matlab&quot;&gt;function [data] = mycomplexop()
    data = zeros(100, 100);
    % Complex things happen in the middle...
    return
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer to comment out plotting code rather than trying to replicate it exactly. Again, we want to focus on the number crunching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Identify test cases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Matlab scripts are written in a style where the inputs to a function are set up, a function or set of functions are called, and then the output is plotted. We need to capture the inputs to this set of functions as well as the inputs. An easy way to do this is using &lt;code&gt;save&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-matlab&quot;&gt;% Set up the inputs.
t = 0:1000;
dt = .1;
g = 10;

save inputs.mat -hdf5

% Call the function
complexoutput = mycomplexfun(t, dt, g);

save outputs.mat -hdf5

% Plotting the output
plot(t, complexoutput);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used Octave here – but you can use &lt;code&gt;-v7.3&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;-hdfd5&lt;/code&gt; to save if you’re using Matlab. &lt;code&gt;mat&lt;/code&gt; files saved in these formats are actually hdf5 files that Python can read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay special attention to randomization. It will be hard to replicate Matlab’s random number generation exactly in Python. Ideally, functions should be independent of randomizations, because functions with random outputs are very hard to test for correctness. If a function requires random variables to implement an algorithm, we can circumvent this issue by giving the function the random data it needs. For example, let’s say we have a function that computes the distribution of the range of a random normal variable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-matlab&quot;&gt;function [dist] = rangedist()
    A = randn(100, 1000);
    dist = max(A, 1) - min(A, 1);
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can rewrite this function so that its source of randomness comes from outside the function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-matlab&quot;&gt;function [dist] = rangedist(A)
    dist = max(A, 1) - min(A, 1);
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we can generate the &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; variable in a script, and save that particular random draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to pick test cases that won’t take more than a few seconds to run. You will be running your tests many times, and these seconds will add up! Toy data is fine. It’s also good practice to test our code on simple inputs where the correct output is clear, for example, all zeros, all ones, etc. Save as many input-output pairs as is necessary to capture the range of behaviours of functions you want to capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to testing our script end-to-end, we may choose to test intermediate computations involved in the script. Testing more fine-grained computations will help you debug your code. If your function is already written as a function, it may call private functions – which can make things a bit tricky. You may need to refactor a bit of the Matlab code to make private functions public so that you can capture both their inputs and outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Writing a test scaffold&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit testing checks whether the results of a function are as expected given a set of inputs. Testing in Python can range from using simple inline &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; statements to sophisticated automated solutions that check that tests pass every time you push code into your repo. In our case, we will use a lightweight manual testing method: hiding test cases behind &lt;code&gt;__name__ == '__main__'&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will create a python module that is meant to be imported, for example, via &lt;code&gt;import mymodule&lt;/code&gt;. When we run the file on the command line, however, via &lt;code&gt;python module.py&lt;/code&gt;, the code hidden behind this &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement will be run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;import numpy as np

def my_complex_fun(A):
    # Complicated things occur.
    return A * 2

def _run_tests():
    # Load inputs.
    with h5py.File('inputs.mat', 'r') as f:
        A = np.array(f['A/value'])

    with h5py.File('outputs.mat', 'r') as f:
        B_ref = np.array(f['B/value'])

    # Call the function.
    B = my_complex_fun(A)

    # Check shapes are good.
    assert A.shape == B.shape

    # Check values are similar.
    np.testing.assert_all_close(B, B_ref)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Run the tests.
    _run_tests()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tests are inside the &lt;code&gt;_run_tests()&lt;/code&gt; function. This way, the module namespace will not be polluted with variables that could have the same name as other variables inside of a function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the code is run, the tests should raise errors if the output is not as expected, which will stop execution. You will see a big old error on the command line, and then you know that you must correct the code. You can raise an error by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; statement. It raises an error whenever the statement is False.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the methods in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.testing.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;np.testing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These methods can check whether, for example, the elements of numpy array are all close to a reference (within numeric error).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;raise&lt;/code&gt; statement to manually raise an error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s really all you need to test code. &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/python-testing/&quot;&gt;Numerous unit-testing libraries in Python exist&lt;/a&gt;, but at their core is the same idea: create code that raises an error when the output not what is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Picking organization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main effects are much easier to test than side effects in the unit-testing framework. You’ll often find yourself writing side-effect-free, modular and functional code for this reason. That’s great! You’ll tend to create smaller functions so that you can test each individual component. Your code will be easier to reason about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Python code you write may be objected-oriented. Although Matlab now has excellent support for classes, much Matlab code, especially older code, eschews the use of classes. If you don’t feel comfortable writing object-oriented code, don’t sweat it – Python code doesn’t have to use classes to be Pythonic. Classes make sense when something needs to remember and manage its own state. &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/&quot;&gt;Here’s a tutorial on Python classes if it’s something that intrigues you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Writing the code – common gotchas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve picked our tests, and picked how we’ll organize our code, we can start coding. Matlab’s matrix operations naturally translate to Numpy. Be careful with these common gotchas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reshape operations will cause you headaches. Matlab uses Fortran order, Python uses C by default. This means in Matlab:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-matlab&quot;&gt;A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]
A(:)

ans = 
    [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas in Python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(A.ravel())
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saving to hdf5 in Matlab and loading in Python will invert axes because of the distinction between C and Fortran order. You will have to swap axes front to back, for example. For example, if you save a three-dimensional tensor in Matlab &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and then load it back in Python via hdf5, you will need to call &lt;code&gt;A.swapaxes((2, 1, 0))&lt;/code&gt; to get back the original tensor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be careful with dimension-one vectors! If you have a one-dimension vector &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; of shape &lt;code&gt;(N, )&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;a.dot(a.T)&lt;/code&gt; gives you a vector of the shape &lt;code&gt;(N, )&lt;/code&gt;. It will not be a scalar, nor a matrix. If you wanted to computed the outer product of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; with itself, use &lt;code&gt;a.reshape((-1, 1)).dot(a.reshape((1, -1)))&lt;/code&gt; or better yet &lt;code&gt;np.outer(a, a)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hidden dot products can cause problems! The &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; operator applies to scalars and to vectors in Matlab, and the semantics are different depending on the dimension of the operands. &lt;code&gt;A.dot(B)&lt;/code&gt; replace Matlab’s &lt;code&gt;A * B&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/&quot;&gt;You may also see &lt;code&gt;A @ B&lt;/code&gt; being used but it’s still rather esoteric&lt;/a&gt;. * Objects in Python have pass-by-reference semantics. Several methods in numpy modify data in place. Be careful! Sometimes, you will explicitly need to &lt;code&gt;copy()&lt;/code&gt; your data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python uses 0-based indices and Matlab 1-based indices. Watch out!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at your data! Don’t fly blind!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you write a piece of code that you suspect may cause a bug, you can use inline &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; statements to make sure it works. I like to use this to check the dimensions of intermediate arrays, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the problems of direct index manipulation can go away by using &lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt; dataframes where appropriate. &lt;a href=&quot;http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;xarray&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; uses named dimensions for tensors, which can help avoid many mistakes caused by the need for swapping axes and reshaping. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;np.einsum&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can express complicated sums and products of tensors in an easy-to-read, less error-prone manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might want to consider translating parts of your numerics to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org/&quot;&gt;PyTorch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/&quot;&gt;Tensorflow&lt;/a&gt; directly, especially if you want to take advantage of automatic differentiation. Performance-sensitive code can be JIT’ed using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/jax&quot;&gt;jax&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://numba.pydata.org/&quot;&gt;numba&lt;/a&gt;, or rewritten in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cython.org/&quot;&gt;Cython&lt;/a&gt;. Start small and optimize as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using the method on a real script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/blob/master/original_force_external_feedback_loop.m&quot;&gt;The example script I rewrote is about 165 lines of code&lt;/a&gt;. It’s written in a pedagogic style and intersperses explanations, logic and plotting. In that sense, it’s similar to a jupyter notebook. I focused on transferring the logic of the main loop, which does a forward simulation of the network and trains it with the FORCE algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to change a handful of things related to plotting to get it to run in Octave, but I was able to get it to run within about 10 minutes. Not bad for 10-year code! The code is organized in this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sets up variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;runs the body of the computation (a big &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop). This body has side effects (plotting).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finishes in an end state that contains the results of the computation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the code is not set up as a function, it was fairly easy to isolate the inputs are – they’re what the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop needs to get started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;x0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;z0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ft&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the outputs are the variables computed in the main for loop, namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;zt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;w0_len&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I captured these inputs and outputs as a test case for my script. I commented out the forward simulation of the trained network that comes after the main for loop since it’s another logically separate component of the code that I could attack later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the end-to-end result of the script, I captured the result of the first iteration of forwarding the network state, to create a more granular test. I also checked array dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to write the code as a class, with methods &lt;code&gt;train&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;simulate&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/blob/master/chaotic_rnn.py&quot;&gt;The resulting code doesn’t look like Matlab code&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, because I’d set up a test scaffold, I could be assured that it works the same as the old Matlab code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation was hard! I ran into multiple very subtle issues translating the rather short code I was working (maybe 20 lines of real logic). The issues were subtle – incorrect manipulation of dimension-1 vectors, off-by-1 errors in a loop. Having reference code and functional tests allowed me to isolate these issues, fix them, and replicate the original functionality exactly. It took about 3 hours, which is a lot! I was very careful to set up a well-defined goalpost when I translated the code, so I knew when I would be done, which kept me going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/blob/master/chaotic_rnn.py&quot;&gt;The translated code is available here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/blob/master/Use%20chaotic%20RNN.ipynb&quot;&gt;I imported the code into a notebook and generated some figures from it&lt;/a&gt; – it runs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using test-driven development, it’s possible to systematically, incrementally transfer legacy Matlab code to the Python environment. You can be assured that the code will &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; in the end because you will have defined what &lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt; means. You will have created a test suite for your code with good coverage for your new Python code. You might even have spotted subtle bugs in the original Matlab code along the way! Future you will thank you for your attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In January 2020, we quietly launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://status.arxiv.org&quot;&gt;status.arxiv.org&lt;/a&gt; — a landing page for arXiv’s operational status. After several weeks of trials, the status page is ready to be shared with the arXiv community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll use &lt;a href=&quot;https://status.arxiv.org&quot;&gt;status.arxiv.org&lt;/a&gt; to announce scheduled maintenance, unscheduled downtime, performance glitches, and other events that might affect your experience interacting with arXiv. If you’re interested in receiving these announcements as they happen you also have the option of subscribing to &lt;a href=&quot;https://subscribe.sorryapp.com/24846f03/email/new&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://subscribe.sorryapp.com/24846f03/slack/new&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; notifications. Most of our announcements will also be &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/arxiv&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. All of these links can also be found in our website footer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing a high level of service continues to be a primary goal, but we recognize that “stuff happens” and this tool will help us better communicate with you when it does. Thank you for your continued support of arXiv.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/19954646-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As people grow older, they may experience changes in their memory, like forgetting an appointment or someone’s name, leading to concerns about their memory functioning. And older adults sometimes report having memory problems despite performing normally on memory tests, such as those conducted by their doctor. Even if cognitive testing is normal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24363073&quot;&gt;subjective memory complaints&lt;/a&gt; are important to consider as they might be an early indicator of more serious problems with memory and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17623488&quot;&gt;cognition&lt;/a&gt; or psychological stress such as depression or anxiety. Older adults can have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23215819&quot;&gt;memory complaints&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26880907&quot;&gt;typical symptoms of depression&lt;/a&gt;, making it difficult for healthcare providers to determine how these symptoms are related. It is unclear from the current research whether, in older adults with both depressive symptoms and memory complaints, depressive symptoms lead to problems with memory or whether the perception of memory problems contributes to the development of depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand the order in which memory complaints and depressive symptoms occur, we need to see how these two symptoms develop within an individual over time. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-1451-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;our new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Geriatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we examine the development of depressive symptoms and memory complaints in two large groups of older adults across periods of 6-18 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we did&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perceiving that their memory is getting worse may lead an older adult to experience symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used two large, publicly available datasets that together represented over 10,000 older adults from across the United States. These longitudinal datasets included measures of memory complaints and depressive symptoms, collected via interviews conducted every year or every other year for up to 18 years. Any older adult experiencing clinically significant changes in their cognition was removed from our study. This is important because individuals with cognitive impairment may not report memory complaints due to a lack of awareness of their memory problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older adults reported their perceptions of their memory in two questions, one for current memory rating and one for memory decline over the past year or two years. The first question asked for a rating of their memory at the present time. A second question then asked whether they perceived their memory to be better, worse, or the same as it was the last time they were interviewed. For depressive symptoms, older adults indicated whether they had recently experienced a range of symptoms e.g., felt down, depressed or hopeless. We controlled for other personal characteristics that might influence depressive symptoms and/or memory complaints such as sex, education level, age, race/ethnicity, income, and marital status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we found&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first examined whether memory complaints co-occurred with depressive symptoms. That is, at times when a person reported a memory complaint, did they report more depressive symptoms? In one of the two datasets, we found that at times when an older adult provided lower current memory ratings, they also reported more depressive symptoms. Importantly, we also found that at times when an older adult reported a decline in memory, they also reported more depressive symptoms at that same interview across both datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then examined whether memory complaints predicted future depressive symptoms. We found that older adults’ rating of their current memory at one interview was not related to their depressive symptoms at the next interview. However, when an older adult reported a decline in memory at one interview, they reported more symptoms of depression at the next interview across both datasets. Interestingly, this was not true in the other direction: current symptoms of depression did not predict future memory complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it means&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helping older adults understand normal changes in memory could prevent increases in depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory complaints are often seen as a symptom of depression in older adults; however, our work suggests that this is not the case for all types of memory complaints. Older adults’ low rating of their memory performance can be related to depressive symptoms, but is not always. In contrast, older adults’ feeling of their memory getting worse over longer periods of time (e.g., a year or two) is consistently related to their current feelings of sadness and hopelessness as well as to increases in future depressive symptoms. Therefore, perceiving that their memory is getting worse may lead an older adult to experience symptoms of depression. This may be because when an older adult feels like their memory is getting worse, they start to experience sadness or hopelessness about their memory, and what it means to grow older in general. Alternatively, for some older adults, perceiving that their memory is getting worse could also trigger fears about dementia or other aging-related disorders. It likely depends on the individual and their different experiences with aging and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health care professionals working with older adults should consider asking them about how their memory is changing over time. These types of questions are necessary to understand how an older adult is currently feeling, but are also important for how they may be feeling at future appointments. This suggests that helping older adults understand normal changes in memory could prevent increases in depressive symptoms and promote better psychological health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>http://xcorr.net/?p=7287</id>
		<updated>2020-02-29T14:30:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
 &lt;p&gt;I was surprised by the amount of positive response to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/&quot;&gt;last article on transitioning away from Matlab&lt;/a&gt;. Many people are ready to switch – but they’re facing some significant challenges. One of the biggest things I’ve heard beginners say is that they are overwhelmed with the number of choices they have to make with Python. Python is open-source, has a decentralized contribution model, and has been around for more than 25 years. For everything that you can do one way in Matlab, there are at least 10 different ways of doing it in Python. Picking the best one is stressful!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-group&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-group__inner-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-jetpack-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my rough guide to orienting yourself with Python. Don’t read it all in one go, it will make your head spin! The goal is not to overwhelm you with information, but to have this information as a reference when you’re ready to use it. The recommendations are based on my personal opinions and experiences. They’re written with the intent of minimizing the amount of research and pain you’ll have to go through as a beginner. Don’t agree? Post in the comments! Feedback is a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part 2 of an ongoing series on learning Python. &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/&quot;&gt;Part 1 – a Python curriculum is here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/&quot;&gt;Part 3 – translating old code with test-driven development is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Which distribution should I choose?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Python distribution on the python.org website &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; include a lot of core packages needed for data science. It also does not include a package manager. A package manager allows you to automatically download and install a set of scripts and modules of a specific version – a package. People recommend using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/&quot;&gt;the Anaconda distribution&lt;/a&gt;, which is more fully-featured. It includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ipython&lt;/code&gt;, the interactive python console.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;conda&lt;/code&gt; package manager. Note that conda and the Anaconda distribution are two different (though similarly named) things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of the core packages needed for data science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An installer that sets your path correctly, which is especially important on Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should pick the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/&quot;&gt;latest stable version of Python 3 that conda comes in, in its 64-bit incarnation&lt;/a&gt;. Python 2 has been deprecated for several years, and you should not be using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Which package manager should I use?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you try to install packages like &lt;code&gt;tensorflow&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pytorch&lt;/code&gt;, you’ll quickly find that there are often two ways to install the same thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;: the lightweight package manager. Originally pip could only install Python packages, but these days it can install non-Python system-wide dependencies to Python packages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;conda&lt;/code&gt;: the heavy-duty package manager. It’s not just for Python, it’s for everything! This includes Python packages with weird dependencies, R and Julia packages, text editors, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, packages will tell you how you should install them. Just follow the instructions. In either program manager, the process is similar: open the command line, type in a command, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install pytorch
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;conda install pytorch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then confirm, and wait for the install to finish. No need to set the path or anything. Generally, I find that conda is slower but it can install a wider range of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Where should I install my packages?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you install a package in Python, you can either install it in the base (or root) environment or in a custom environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; A virtual environment is a named, isolated, working copy of Python that that maintains its own files, directories, and paths so that you can work with specific versions of libraries or Python itself without affecting other Python projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re coming from the Matlab world, you know all the annoyances that come with managing the path. Imagine removing the path and replacing it wholesale when you switch projects. That’s sort of what environments do in Python. Another metaphor you might like is a virtual machine or a container. It’s a little sandbox in which you can put packages. If you bonk your environment, you delete it and create a new one. No need to reinstall your computer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few different environment managers, but since you installed Anaconda (above) and you have &lt;code&gt;conda&lt;/code&gt; installed, you want to use &lt;code&gt;conda&lt;/code&gt; environments. When you get started, you can put everything in the &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; environment. Later on, you’ll find this limiting (maybe you’ll have messed up your install with incompatible dependencies after a bit), so you’ll create another environment, perhaps called &lt;code&gt;py3&lt;/code&gt;. Later still, you might start creating one environment per project (with its own Github repo!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packages that have very specific sets of dependencies will sometimes ask you to recreate an environment &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt;. In that case, follow the instructions to the letter; the package probably needs an old version of a package or has esoteric system-wide dependencies that you will waste hours trying to track down. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/conda-environments/README.md&quot;&gt;One package that requires this is DeepLabCut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Which packages should I install?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the packages included by default in anaconda are your standard bread-and-butter for data science, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;matplotlib for plotting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;numpy for matrices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scipy for signal processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pandas for dataframes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sklearn for machine learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these packages has millions of users, they are very active and they’re supported by grants and commercial entities. You can rely on them. I also list &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/&quot;&gt;well-supported packages for neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; in the previous article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about more esoteric needs? How do I intuit whether I’m going to waste a bunch of time on a package that doesn’t work? Here are a few heuristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7292&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7292&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;github-stars-highlights&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/github-stars-highlights.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/github-stars-highlights.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/github-stars-highlights.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1980,694&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/github-stars-highlights/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/github-stars-highlights.png?w=723&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-jetpack-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many stars does it have on Github (1 in the above picture)? If it has 1k+ stars, it’s a very well-used project. If it’s smaller than 100 – beware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When is the last commit on Github (2 in the above picture)? If it’s more than a year, chances are the package is abandoned. This may make it difficult to install.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When in doubt, ask! Ask your labmates, on Twitter, on your favorite Discourse or at a local meetup. Use whatever everybody else is using – this way, it will be easier to get support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Which IDE should I use?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two categories of integrated development environment for Python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code editors. You edit code that you can run from inside the editor. Code editors will have a file explorer, variables explorer, a plotting window, a console window, a graphical debugger, etc. These programs can approximate more or less faithfully the experience you have with Matlab. In some cases, they offer many, many more features. They run as standalone programs on your computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notebook editors. You edit a visual document consisting of cells that can be run in any arbitrary order. Plots are saved inline and code can be interspersed with formatted text and formulas. Notebooks run inside in your browser and can connect to remote workers (Python doesn’t have to be on your computer, it can be in the cloud).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked on Twitter what people tend to use, and it’s fairly evenly split. Many commented that they use both code editors and notebook editors in their day-to-day work. If I want to train a deep neural net for example, I might:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a script in a code editor, testing it on toy data with the built-in command line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the script inside of a terminal overnight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze the results inside of a notebook the next day.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/top-python-ides-for-2019&quot;&gt;Here is a very good article that weighs all the different options&lt;/a&gt; – it’s long! Here is my current hot take:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Code editors: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spyder-ide.org/&quot;&gt;Spyder is the most bare-bones IDE of the bunch, and approximates Matlab well&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a great starter IDE. I love Atom in general but I find &lt;a href=&quot;https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Installation.html&quot;&gt;Hydrogen&lt;/a&gt;‘s lack of a console limiting. I prefer &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;VSCode&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python&quot;&gt;the Python extension&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/&quot;&gt;PyCharm&lt;/a&gt; is by far the most advanced editor, with intelligent inferences on your code and automated fixes that feel like magic. It can also be overwhelming because it has so many features, and it also isn’t free (a license is 89$ a year). If you spend 8 hours a day doing Python, PyCharm might the editor for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Notebook editors: &lt;a href=&quot;https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&quot;&gt;Jupyterlab&lt;/a&gt; does everything jupyter does and more. &lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true&quot;&gt;Colab&lt;/a&gt; adds sharing capabilities, and you can use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/colabs&quot;&gt;free-tier TPU&lt;/a&gt; with it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Which GUI toolkit should I use?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7290&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7290&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;gui-toolkits&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png?w=723&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1030,526&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/gui-toolkits/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png?w=723&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I asked on Twitter recently, and it seems that many people are choosing &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt&quot;&gt;PyQt5&lt;/a&gt; to build desktop applications. Qt has a very nice builder to graphically design your GUI, as well as code generators to eliminate writing your own boilerplate. wxPython is also well-loved for larger-scale applications, while tkinter doesn’t have quite all the knobs and options you’d want for a fully-fledged app.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;PyTorch or Tensorflow?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s a tough one! I’ve worked with both in a professional setting at Google and Facebook. As an end-user, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org/&quot;&gt;PyTorch&lt;/a&gt; is generally considered to be easier to use. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tensorflow.org&quot;&gt;Tensorflow&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of support for advanced features, like probabilistic programming, and is used by downstream libraries for this reason, for example in the up-and-coming PyMC4. If you use Tensorflow, you probably want to start with &lt;a href=&quot;https://keras.io/&quot;&gt;Keras&lt;/a&gt;, which has a higher-level API.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;What about plotting? How do I make nice figures?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://matplotlib.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt; is the package that most people start with&lt;/a&gt;. Its API is very similar to Matlab, by design. It creates plots which are not very aesthetically pleasing, by default, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/aesthetics.html&quot;&gt;you can easily improve them by using seaborn’s styling&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot;&gt;import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.set()  # From now on matplotlib will use the seaborn theme.
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7295&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_7_0.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-7295&quot; data-attachment-id=&quot;7295&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;aesthetics_7_0&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_7_0.png?w=370&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_7_0.png?w=300&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_7_0.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;370,248&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/aesthetics_7_0/&quot; src=&quot;https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_9_0.png&quot; /&gt;Matplotlib plot before and after seaborn styling&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many other packages build on &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt;, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://seaborn.pydata.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;seaborn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a number of useful plot types, including violin plots and histograms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plotnine&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which implements the grammar of graphics (&lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt; in R).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are a number of up-and-coming visualization libraries that are not using matplotlib under the hood. The one with the most support behind it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py&quot;&gt;plotly&lt;/a&gt;. It creates interactive plots that can be shared easily, includes support for other languages outside of Python, and is supported commercially by the plotly company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Picking up Python can feel overwhelming as an outsider – so many decisions to make! I was endlessly reading through articles and doing comparison shopping when I was starting out. Picking what others around you are already using will help you get support when you’re starting out. Ask around! Enjoy the ride!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/Support_5504-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family carers are often invisible to the health care system in meeting the care needs of older people. Yet, family carers – people who assist a family member or friend with challenges resulting from illness, disability or aging – &lt;a href=&quot;https://healthcouncilcanada.ca/files/HCC_HomeCare_FA.pdf&quot;&gt;provide three-quarters of the care older adults receive&lt;/a&gt;. Demands on family carers are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/abs/10.3138/Q326-4625-5753-K683&quot;&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt; as populations age, disability rates increase, and demands on our health and continuing care sectors escalate. In these circumstances, sustainability of family care becomes a pressing issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand family caring roles, and how technology might support them, we conducted focus groups and an online survey with carers in Canada. As reported in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-1455-x?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;our new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Geriatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we learned that family carers want to enhance the care they currently provide, but they recognize that they have to protect their own capacity to care first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protecting family carers’ well-being&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11737 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/2_0020-300x200.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To protect their own well-being, and their ongoing capacity to provide care, family carers want to take better care of themselves, develop better coping strategies, and have opportunities for mentorship and socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family carers sought more time and space for themselves as part of their overall sustainability. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/tpp/ijcc/2019/00000003/00000003/art00009&quot;&gt;Sustainability &lt;/a&gt;in this context refers to carers’ ability to balance the demands of caring for their loved ones without jeopardizing their own health, well-being, and quality of life. This is easier said than done as carers struggle to find a few hours to care for themselves as individuals with their own interests and needs while caring for others. Developing better coping strategies and becoming more resilient is a learned skill. Rebalancing the negative and positive aspects of caregiving, focusing on mindfulness, reducing stress, and celebrating small victories can help reframe the emotional experience of caregiving. As one carer put it,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If caregivers had time off, their health would hopefully remain good. Currently, burnout and health implications are inevitable.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, at times, family carers feel guilty about putting their own needs first. They want &lt;em&gt;“better networking with other caregivers, sharing our stories to make things easier,” &lt;/em&gt;and reducing the social isolation they often experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancing family carers’ capacity to provide quality care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enhance caregiving capacity, family carers want information about their care receivers’ conditions to help them plan, and the ability to navigate existing resources, programs and supports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing “what comes next” is a central desire for many family carers, so that they can plan for an unpredictable future, manage expectations, and make informed decisions. Having this sense of control contributes to their overall well-being. One carer wished for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“…a crystal ball so I know what the future might look like, so I can prepare more for what might be required as we go forward.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family carers also feel lost, navigating fragmented health and social support services without a road map. They may not know what supports and programs are available or whether they qualify for any they do know about. Making sense of the flood of online information is overwhelming in the face of family carers’ time-consuming care responsibilities. Another carer described the situation as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It is like a library with the books in a pile on the floor and no card catalogue to even let me know where to start.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted technology development can help carers achieve their goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11738 alignright&quot; height=&quot;199&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/Jacquie-and-Gigi-Dec04_51040-300x199.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When considering technology development to support carers, traditional problem‐focused approaches to technology design can limit discussions to performing caregiving tasks, failing to capture the relational and emotional aspects of caregiving. While technology is not the panacea that product developers and policy makers hope for, family carers did offer suggestions about how they are, or could be, using technology to enhance and preserve their caregiving capacity. Some carers use off-the-shelf technology to support their caregiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“My [Smart] watch tells me to breathe. It tells me to stand. Honestly. Sometimes it gets me up and I take a moment. I breathe.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other family carers thought of ways to modify existing technology to make it support their goals. They imagined:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private internet-based chat rooms or interactive apps for information exchange.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A comprehensive, searchable repository of available supports that can yield individually tailored ‘system’ navigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced search engines that use artificial intelligence to organize, evaluate, synthesize and summarize large amounts of information available from the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart watches that monitor blood pressure or heart rate and proactively offer calming or stress reducing activities and techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interactive smart phone applications, like Siri, to help carers problem-solve and find solutions to in-the-moment issues like dealing with care receivers’ challenging behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking applications or online portals to connect family carers to mentors, counselors and each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telephone information services to point family carers to services, supports and guidance along their care journeys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systems that connect carers, providing opportunities for socialization, recreation and reducing social isolation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, technology alone is not enough to sustain family care work. According to University of Birmingham social policy professor Paul Burstow, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healtheuropa.eu/benefits-technology-enabled-care/87408/&quot;&gt;getting the balance right between ‘tech’ and ‘touch’ is vital&lt;/a&gt;.” The insights gained from our work are an important first step in achieving this balance by understanding carers’ goals and figuring out how to support them in meaningful ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Open science should be boosted in 2020 as the number of journals with research data policies increases as a result of collective action by publishers, who are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stm-researchdata.org/getting-started/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;being encouraged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; to adopt a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-005&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;new common framework for journal data policies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. PLOS is the first publisher to align the policies of all its journals with this new framework&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Context&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To enable reproducible research we need transparent and accessible research outputs. And, as an enabler of reproducibility, transparency is what we – journals and publishers – can reasonably ask for, or even demand. Asking for transparency can begin not with new or sophisticated technology, but with a relatively low tech solution: policy.  Introducing a policy on research data sharing is a logical first step to raising awareness of an issue and beginning to create change. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Policies have been in place for sharing some specific kinds of research data (such as protein structural data and genetic sequences) for a quarter of a century or more. Since 2014, PLOS has led the way with a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;mandatory data availability policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; for all our articles, and since 2016 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insights.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/uksg.463/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;most larger publishers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; – Springer Nature, Elsevier, Wiley, Taylor &amp;amp; Francis – have introduced tiered data policy initiatives. Coupled with discipline-specific policy initiatives, such as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copdess.org/enabling-fair-data-project/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;in Earth sciences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, this means thousands of journals now have a data policy of some kind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Making a statement about data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;An important tool, used by PLOS and others, for introducing a consistent data policy is a data availability statement in every published article. These statements indicate if, how and where the data supporting claims made in an article are available. Many journal and publisher research data policies still make data sharing and data availability statements optional rather than mandatory, but we welcome this steady progress on open research policies in the scholarly publishing community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Since mandating data sharing and data availability statements in 2014, PLOS has published more than 127,000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;articles with a data availability statement and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194768&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02565&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;than&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229578&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; study has analysed them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Requiring a new section in every article published incurs costs, which at PLOS we see as a worthwhile investment in open research. It &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/614&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;takes time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, training and resources for editors, authors, peer reviewers and editorial office staff, so mandating these statements is understandably a consideration for other publishers of thousands of articles per year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There is growing recognition &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zenodo.org/record/1476871#.XjLptGj7S72&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;from funders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, academic societies, editorial groups such as the ICMJE, that data availability statements are a practical, achievable and meaningful improvement to support transparency in research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wider adoption in 2020&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The growth rate of journal research data policies is likely to increase with the launch, in January 2020, of the STM Association’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stm-researchdata.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;STM research data year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, which has an objective to increase the number of journals with data policies and articles with data availability statements. Progress on policy implementation will be tracked across thousands of journals (STM is a publishing industry association with more than 120 organisational members). This feels like a turning point in open research policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The STM Association is recommending the use of a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-005&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; common policy framework for journal research data policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; to promote consistent approaches to journal research data policies, at its wide variety of members.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The policy framework – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-005&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;published &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;last week in a peer-reviewed journal after being &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://figshare.com/articles/Developing_a_research_data_policy_framework_for_all_journals_and_publishers/8223365/1&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;available as a preprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; – is an output of an initiative, begun in 2016, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-policy-standardisation-and-implementation-ig&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;within the Research Data Alliance organisation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. The framework includes 14 features, or common elements, of journal research data policies – including data citation, data repositories, and data peer review – and reusable policy text for journal editors and publishers to implement on their journals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In 2019, we compared PLOS’ data availability policy to this framework and, as a first step, updated some of the language, such as to give &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-data-management-plans&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;explicit support for sharing Data Management Plans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; (DMPs) – a document increasingly required in funding agency data policies. In doing so, PLOS continues to lead the way, by being the first publisher, to our knowledge, to align its entire journal portfolio with this new framework. As well increasing data sharing, another anticipated benefit of harmonising policy is reducing the burden on researchers and support staff with different or conflicting requirements between journals, and funders. The framework also provides future opportunities to review data policy language to ensure requirements are easily understood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We’re looking forward to collaborating with publishers and researchers to continue driving up standards for transparency and openness in research in 2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about the paper &quot;Cliques of Neurons Bound into Cavities Provide a Missing Link between Structure and Function&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of a formal link between neural network structure and its emergent function
has hampered our understanding of how the brain processes information. We have now come
closer to describing such a link by taking the direction of synaptic transmission into
account, constructing graphs of a network that reflect the direction of information
flow, and analyzing these directed graphs using algebraic topology. Applying this
approach to a local network of neurons in the neocortex revealed a remarkably intricate
and previously unseen topology of synaptic connectivity. The synaptic network contains
an abundance of cliques of neurons bound into cavities that guide the emergence of
correlated activity. In response to stimuli, correlated activity binds synaptically
connected neurons into functional cliques and cavities that evolve in a stereotypical
sequence toward peak complexity. We propose that the brain processes stimuli by forming
increasingly complex functional cliques and cavities.&lt;/p&gt;

Current efforts to develop human organoid models will help us understand more about how our organs are formed and function and how to help in cases where diseases occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcdevbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12861-020-0209-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;In our study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcdevbiol.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog&quot;&gt;BMC Developmental Biology&lt;/a&gt; we describe the generation of human pancreas organoids (hPOs) and show how they could be used in future research. The pancreas is located alongside the stomach and plays a critical role in our digestive system. Three main cell types are found in the pancreas; &lt;strong&gt;1) endocrine cells&lt;/strong&gt; which reside in the islets of Langerhans and produce hormones including insulin that control sugar metabolism in our bodies, &lt;strong&gt;2) acinar cells&lt;/strong&gt; which produce digestive enzymes and &lt;strong&gt;3) pancreatic ductal cells&lt;/strong&gt; that form ducts (highlighted in figure 1) to collect the digestive enzymes and transport them to the small intestine to aid with the breakdown of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11729&quot; style=&quot;width: 528px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-11729&quot; height=&quot;342&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/pancreas-300x198.jpg&quot; width=&quot;518&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 1: The pancreas is part of the digestive system, note the connection of the pancreas to the intestine through the pancreatic duct.

WikiJournal of Medicine 1 (2). DOI:10.15347/wjm/2014.010. ISSN 2002-4436.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malfunction of these cells is associated with a series of pancreatic diseases. Pancreatic cancer can affect any of these cell types and has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(19)30456-5/fulltext&quot;&gt;lowest survival rate in the UK&lt;/a&gt; among all cancer types.  Diabetes is the most common disease of the endocrine compartment and affects over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-prevalence.html&quot;&gt;4 million people in the UK&lt;/a&gt;.  Other serious diseases, although perhaps less well known, include pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), cystic fibrosis (which affects ductal cells) and pancreatic insufficiency (reduced acinar cell function). Severe cases of pancreatic disease often leave patients with the need for a pancreas or islet cell transplant deriving from deceased organ donors. However, the greatest hurdles to pancreas transplants include a limited number of organ donors and a need for life-time immunosuppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aimed to produce a 3D culture system for long-term expansion of hPOs to serve as the basis for studies of pancreas ductal cells, pancreatic diseases and the development of cell therapy for diabetes. Whilst developing the hPO model we were aware that for a cell therapy to translate into the clinic it must meet certain criteria which include cell expansion in a chemically defined manner that is compatible with Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) with strong evidence that the cells pose no risk of tumour formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate hPOs, we isolated ductal fragments from small samples of human pancreatic tissue and placed these in an ECM to act as a 3D scaffold. In order for this to be successful we had to develop a culture medium which would include all the signals and growth factors required to support the transition of pancreatic ducts into expandable pancreas organoids (Figure 2). Through a series of optimisations and iterations in which we tested activators and inhibitors of key cell signalling pathways we achieved a chemically defined culture medium that sustains the long-term culture of the pancreas cells. In addition, we developed a protocol to freeze the pancreatic tissue and recover healthy long-term expanding organoids from it. This gives us the ability to bank tissue, share samples and derive organoids at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11730&quot; style=&quot;width: 664px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-11730&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/pancreas-2-300x172.jpg&quot; width=&quot;654&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 2: Human pancreatic ducts can be cultured in vitro and expanded as pancreatic organoids.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, genetic analysis showed that even after long-term expansion the hPOs did not show large genetic abnormalities. This is crucial, as accumulation of genetic defects during culturing, can alter cellular behaviours and impact on the results. We also found that upon transplant of these cells into mouse pancreas the hPO cells do not form tumours, indicating their genetic safety both in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we aimed to develop a chemically defined ECM in which to culture hPOs as the commonly used ECMs (Matrigel and BME 2-RGF) are animal-derived and are unsuitable for cell therapies. In collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cellendes.com/&quot;&gt;Cellendes&lt;/a&gt;, a company specialised in hydrogel technology, we could show for the first time the derivation and expansion of hPOs in a fully chemically defined hydrogel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our demonstration of the long-term expansion of human pancreas organoids in chemically defined conditions makes this an exciting system for many areas of research (Figure 3). This system can be used as a model of healthy ductal pancreas biology and the development of disease models of the ductal compartment, such as cystic fibrosis. Organoids can also be derived from diseased states and have already been used to model different types of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286741401592X?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; (PDAC and IPMN).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_11731&quot; style=&quot;width: 615px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-11731&quot; height=&quot;222&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/pancreas-3-300x110.jpg&quot; width=&quot;605&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--caption&quot;&gt;Figure 3: Human pancreatic organoids have the potential to be used in many areas of research such as investigations into healthy tissue, diseased tissue and regenerative medicine.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-image--source&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critically, our protocol does not rely on altering the genome or identity of the cells in order to achieve long-term expansion. This, combined with the lack of tumour formation when transplanted into mice, makes hPOs a safe approach for potential cell therapies. Cell therapies offer hope for patients without available curative treatment options. They provide the possibility of treating a disease by extracting cells from the patient or other donors, altering them in the lab to generate working cells and transplanting them into the patient. In theory, this would treat the disease while removing the need for immunosuppression as the cells would be either self-derived or very closely matched to the patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adaptation of the culture system for human cells was funded by an EU programme (LSFM4LIFE) which aims at investigating the potential of hPOs as a clinical cell therapy. Whether hPOs could be the source for a cell therapy transplantation for diabetes remains to be investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB">
 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/slimming-2728331_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all have some knowledge about how to lose weight, but this does not often change what we do. Using formal weight loss services can be effective in helping people who want to lose weight. In most parts of the UK, people who want to lose weight can be referred to an evidence-based group or a one-to-one weight loss program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, engagement of men in these weight loss programs is low. Men make up 11-25% of people who go to Counterweight, Weight Watchers, Slimming World and Rosemary Conley Diet and Fitness Clubs. With a greater prevalence overweight men compared to women in the UK, and rising obesity rates globally, this lack of engagement is concerning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study, published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, sought to understand what influences the engagement of men in weight loss services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Study findings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only me and two other guys and about 40 women [at Weight Watchers], which is a bit off-putting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through interviews with 18 men with different experiences of weight loss programs (from not taking part to repeated engagers) we identified two key themes: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fear as a motivation for change&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attitudes towards existing weight loss services&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme 1: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fear as a motivation for change:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  A medical diagnosis, coupled with instructions and a referral from a healthcare professional, triggered feelings of fear and worry, which motivated men to engage with weight loss programs. Awareness of severe alternative treatments, irreversible damage caused by obesity and impaired mobility were also key motivators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“My weight had gone up to 160kg … and my GP hinted at, well you don’t want to carry on putting on weight because you might have to have a gastric band &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;and I said no, we’re not going to go there&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;” [Participant 2]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the effects of long-term weight problems on family members often boosted men’s personal motivation and helped them to understand how severe their situation was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I lost my sister-in-law … for her whole life she had a massive weight problem, and I put it down, you know, at the end it cost her life” [Participant 8]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme 2:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Attitudes towards existing weight loss services:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Although these medical triggers and fears were powerful, men were still often reluctant to join in or stick with weight loss programs. Two sub-themes may explain why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subtheme 1: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Female-dominated services:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  Men often found themselves in the minority, provoking feelings of self-consciousness and embarrassment, particularly due to the weight loss context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Only me and two other guys and about 40 women [at Weight Watchers], which is a bit off-putting” [Participant 4]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some men felt that the female-dominated weight loss service threatened their identity and participating or worrying about weight was not perceived as a ‘manly’ thing to do; men also reported a lack of social support from discussing weight with peers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I think it’s just the stigma that’s attached to it for weight loss for men, they think it’s more of a woman’s thing to lose weight and worry about their weight” [Participant 7]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subtheme 2: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incompatibility of existing services for men:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;Often, available services were not what the men wanted; programs that focused on discussing weight and praising weight loss were seen as intrusive and overbearing. This often led to men not taking part, only partially engaging or dropping out altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“All clap each other and that, that doesn’t work for me, because that’s quite embarrassing for me. They have like a slimmer of the week and all that stuff, that doesn’t work for me” [P13, Repeater, Commercial]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Implications for practice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-11727&quot; height=&quot;195&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/exercise-300x195.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Men in the study discussed strong motivations to lose weight, triggered by fear resulting from a medical diagnosis or complication. The findings highlight the importance of healthcare professionals raising the issue of weight with patients. However, men are less likely to visit the GP compared to women, so engaging men in alternative, non-medicalized settings, is also vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings that existing services are perceived to be female-dominated and misalign with men’s preferences emphasize the importance of providing a variety of service formats (e.g. men-only, mixed groups, one-to-one), which may be more compatible and satisfactory for men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding motivations and barriers to engaging is key to addressing them and reducing rising rates of obesity, overweight and associated weight-related health problems.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/02/ancient-arch-architecture-art-415585-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The REF’s new Open Access requirement &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Every five or six years, UK academic researchers submit their most impactful research for expert review and evaluation by the four higher education funding bodies in a process known as the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Research Excellence Framework (REF)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. The results of this quality assessment inform funding allocations for the next cycle and can impact university reputations. For 2021, the REF has introduced a new Open Access (OA) policy for research published after 1 April 2016. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;The good news is, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;ALL &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLOS journals meet the standards laid out in the new REF guidelines.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“The four UK HE funding bodies believe that the outputs of publicly funded research should be freely accessible and widely available. Open access research brings benefits to researchers, students, institutions, governments, public bodies, professionals and practitioners, citizen scientists and many others.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;— REF 2021: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ref.ac.uk/media/1228/open_access_summary__v1_0.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Overview of Open Access policy &amp;amp; guidance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Why Open matters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/open-access&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Open Access&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; lets you maximise the impact or your research by making it available for anyone, anywhere in the world to find, read and reuse. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;With &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;immediate and unrestricted access to the latest research, we can accelerate discovery and create a more equitable system of knowledge that is open to all. That means connecting with interdisciplinary researchers in other fields as well as peers in your community, and providing teachers, students, funders, and policymakers equal access to the latest research findings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/02/HarrietGliddon.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9062 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;140&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/02/HarrietGliddon.png&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;At the most basic level, our research is funded by the UK taxpayer, so it’s vital that it isn’t hidden behind a paywall. But I think it goes deeper than that – we’re all standing on the shoulders of giants and learning from what others have done before us. To deny that knowledge to anyone else would be wrong in many ways, but at the most simple level it would result in more time and money spent on research that has already been done.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The UK REF OA guidelines in a nutshell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To qualify for the UK REF under the new OA policy, research articles must meet three requirements:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;form action=&quot;http://feeds.plos.org/action_page.php&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discovery Requirement:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Published or deposited in a form that allows anyone with internet access to search electronically within the text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deposit Requirement: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Published in a journal or deposited in a repository under a CC BY-NC-ND or less restrictive licence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Access Requirement: &lt;/b&gt;Published Open Access or deposited in a qualifying repository within three months of publication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Unsure if your journal or repository qualifies? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ref.sherpa.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Consult the Sherpa REF database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Fully Open – beyond minimum compliance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We tick all the boxes. PLOS articles are CC BY, embargo-free, fully machine readable, and automatically archived in PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, and other databases-so you can focus on your science and leave the publication details to us. As a fully OA publisher, PLOS also complies with the stricter OA requirements of funders like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/guidance/open-access-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Wellcome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatesfoundation.org/how-we-work/general-information/open-access-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Gates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Submit your latest research in preprint form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Each element submitted to the REF is rated on a 5-point scale between 4 (world-leading) and 0 (below standard) on the basis of originality, significance and rigour. Researchers demonstrate their accomplishments by submitting their most creative, impactful and technically demanding works. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In another exciting development, the 2021 REF will consider publicly posted preprints, even if the final article publication date falls outside the 31st December, 2020 cutoff. When you submit to PLOS, you can choose to have your manuscript &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/preprints&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;automatically posted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; to bioRxiv*, ensuring your work will qualify for the REF regardless of publication date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Social Psychology looks at the nature and causes of individual behavior in social situations. It asks how others’ actions and behaviors shape our actions and behaviors, how our identities are shaped by the beliefs and assumptions of our communities. Fundamentally it looks for scientific answers to the most philosophical questions of self. These seven books about a range of issues within social psychology—identity, gender and sexuality, radicalism, social assumptions and biases—address just a few of the questions about who we are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-strange-case-of-donald-j-trump-9780197507445&quot;&gt;Strange Case of Donald J. Trump: A Psychological Reckoning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan P. McAdams &lt;/strong&gt;In the summer of 2016, Dan McAdams wrote one of The Atlantic’s most widely-read pieces on the soon-to-be-elected 45&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; president—&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/the-mind-of-donald-trump/480771/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mind of Donald Trump&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  In his new book—a collection of stand-alone essays that each explore a single psychological facet of the president—McAdams makes the startling assertion that Trump may just be the rare person who lacks any inner life story. More than just a political and psychological biography, this book is a vivid illustration of the intricate relationship between narrative and identity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/finding-truth-in-fiction-9780190643607&quot;&gt;Finding Truth in Fiction: What Fan Culture Gets Right—and Why it’s Good to Get Lost in a Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Karen E. Dill-Shackelford and Cynthia Vinney &lt;img height=&quot;188&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Book1-145x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;124&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In almost everyone’s life there is a book, a movie, or a television show that has a personal impact that would seem disproportionate for a fictional work. Karen E. Dill-Shackelford and Cynthia Vinney illustrate how engagement with fictional worlds provides the very mental models that inform how we exist in this world. Being a fan—of Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Star Trek, or &lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt;—is being human.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/isis-propaganda-9780190932466&quot;&gt;ISIS Propaganda: A Full-Spectrum Extremist Message&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; edited by Stephane J. Baele, Katharine A. Boyd, and Travis G. Coan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conflict, aggression, radicalism, and terrorism are at their very cores matters of psychology and motivation. This book uses a multidisciplinary approach to show of how a group like the Islamic State could so successfully spread its message across the region and how people can counter these narratives in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-radicals-journey-9780190851095&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Radical’s Journey: How German Neo-Nazis Voyaged to the Edge and Back&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Arie W. Kruglanski, David Webber, and Daniel Koehler&lt;img height=&quot;194&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/book-2-145x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;128&quot; /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a turbulent global environment where extremist ideology has gained more mainstream popularity, &lt;em&gt;The Radical’s Journey&lt;/em&gt; is a critical addition to scholarship on radicalization by leading experts in the field. Drawn from rare interviews with former members of the German far-right groups, the book delves into the motivations of those who join and ultimately leave neo-Nazi groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/old-man-country-9780190689988&quot;&gt;Old Man Country: My Search for Meaning Among the Elders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Thomas R. Cole&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, a 65-year-old man will more likely than not live to see his 85&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. What life looks like in a man’s ninth decade can be a daunting unknown. Thomas R. Cole spoke with a dozen prominent American men—including &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://medium.com/history-uncut/the-moral-world-of-paul-volcker-658e5c941008&quot;&gt;former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker&lt;/a&gt; and spiritual leader Ram Dass—to answer four questions about old age: am I still a man? Do I still matter? What is the meaning of my life? Am I loved?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-to-be-childless-9780190918620&quot;&gt;How to Be Childless: A History and Philosophy of Life Without Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Rachel Chrastil &lt;img height=&quot;195&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Book3-145x220.jpg&quot; width=&quot;129&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a common perception that someone’s status as a parent is the most unequivocally important role they she play in society, but the way this assumption erases the experiences of those who do not have children is profoundly difficult. This book explores &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-single/202001/people-who-never-have-children-21-facts-500-years&quot;&gt;the state of childlessness from the past 500 years&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a narrative that could empower readers—parents and the childless alike—to navigate their lives with purpose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/out-in-time-9780190686604&quot;&gt;Out in Time: The Public Lives of Gay Men from Stonewall to the Queer Generation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Perry N. Halkitis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Library Journal&lt;/em&gt; called this book, “the rare nonfiction book that can also be a work of art.” Perry N. Halkitis’s new book looks at the experience of coming out across three generations in America—the Stonewall generation, the AIDS generation, and the Queer generation, and explores how, while sociology of life for LGBTQ people has changed, the underlying psychology has not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither science nor philosophy will ever answer all of the questions of why we behave the way we do. But these seven books on social psychology answer a few them, and more importantly, raise hundreds more questions to keep the pursuit understanding forever moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Featured image by Frida Aguilar Estrada via&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/VKxWJlA_q6I&quot;&gt; Unsplash&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/02/seven-psychology-books-that-explore-why-we-are-who-we-are-reading-list/&quot;&gt;Seven psychology books that explore why we are who we are [reading list]&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com&quot;&gt;OUPblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/618926050/0/oupblogpsychology&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/618926050/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/618926050/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/618926050/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/618926050/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/618926050/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f02%2fBook1-145x220.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/618926050/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/618926050/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/618926050/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/618926050/oupblogpsychology&quot;&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;clear: left; padding-top: 10px;&quot;&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-to-be-an-ally-for-transgender-rights/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How to be an ally for transgender rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/02/how-dating-apps-reflect-our-changing-times/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How dating apps reflect our changing times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-to-rate-and-rank-potential-doctoral-students/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How to rate and rank potential doctoral students&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

It had been 16 months since we’d been together, and The City was not pleased. A vivid image of the security lines at the airport ushered me out of town to continue my journey to The Place That Doesn’t Exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A diabolical entanglement known as time has stolen memories from their homes in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11028&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;involved in the formation of new memories&quot;&gt;dentate gyrus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5920/1492&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Selective Erasure of a Fear Memory&quot;&gt;lateral amygdala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6418/1045&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Fast track to the neocortex: A memory engram in the posterior parietal cortex&quot;&gt;precuneus&lt;/a&gt;, and elsewhere. These engrams hold the key to the past and the future. Without them – and their mysteriously stored representations – “we are condemned to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6473/eaaw4325.full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Josselyn &amp;amp; Tonegawa (2020), 'Memory engrams: Recalling the past and imagining the future'&quot;&gt;eternal present&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dwelling in the present is the path to enlightenment – “…the only moment to be alive is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Being-Peace-Thich-Nhat-Hanh/dp/0938077007&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Thich Nhat Hanh, 'Being Peace'&quot;&gt;present moment&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; There is no past and no future.

So does avoidance of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.wordpress.com/2018/09/22/derealization-dying/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Derealization / Dying&quot;&gt;unlivable present&lt;/a&gt;.

They all silence my memories of The City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've had hundreds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://neurocritic.wordpress.com/2019/01/16/involuntary-visual-imagery/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;involuntary visual images&lt;/a&gt; appear in my mind's eye like photographs, and I've documented all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RO1A76N76Fw/XlHcabM1nBI/AAAAAAAANDM/BF5-K1-sxQgboeG7zRjQoH7a7SlbSoBEQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/outside%2BNuba%2Blooking%2Bat%2BVictory%2BSquare%2Band%2Bup%2BHamilton_edit.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;440&quot; data-original-width=&quot;864&quot; height=&quot;202&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RO1A76N76Fw/XlHcabM1nBI/AAAAAAAANDM/BF5-K1-sxQgboeG7zRjQoH7a7SlbSoBEQCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/outside%2BNuba%2Blooking%2Bat%2BVictory%2BSquare%2Band%2Bup%2BHamilton_edit.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The images visit me rarely these days. They must be forcefully shaken from their torpor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My passport expired 6 months ago. I finally noticed this recently. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-405k5zEeDg8/XlHczrz34AI/AAAAAAAANDU/mzCz0q5NXX41XHX8itVVu5wnX6Y8PB-IACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/fuzzy%2Bengram_view%2Bnear%2BTrinity.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;474&quot; data-original-width=&quot;772&quot; height=&quot;245&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-405k5zEeDg8/XlHczrz34AI/AAAAAAAANDU/mzCz0q5NXX41XHX8itVVu5wnX6Y8PB-IACLcBGAsYHQ/s400/fuzzy%2Bengram_view%2Bnear%2BTrinity.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;I used to be able to cry, but now I can’t cry even though I want to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Engram Cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meditation on memory, loss, and memory loss was inspired by a recent review article on memory engrams (&lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6473/eaaw4325.full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Josselyn &amp;amp; Tonegawa, 2020&lt;/a&gt;). An “engram” is the neural substrate for storing and recalling memories. Futuristic “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Inception&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-like” experiments in mice have shown that conditioned fear memories (tone-shock or context-shock associations) can be deleted or “inserted” by manipulating a functionally-defined class of neurons known as engram cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u8pK5vlWtqg/XlIB70mZugI/AAAAAAAANDs/QraNC3lvH-IxvEF73koENGlzVAG1uBN5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/An%2Bengram%2Bcell%2Balongside%2Ba%2Bnonengram%2Bcell.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;441&quot; data-original-width=&quot;441&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u8pK5vlWtqg/XlIB70mZugI/AAAAAAAANDs/QraNC3lvH-IxvEF73koENGlzVAG1uBN5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/An%2Bengram%2Bcell%2Balongside%2Ba%2Bnonengram%2Bcell.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;A pink engram cell alongside a white nonengram cell&lt;/b&gt; (modified from &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6473/eaaw4325.full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Josselyn &amp;amp; Tonegawa, 2020&lt;/a&gt;). Within the hippocampus, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentate_gyrus%20title=&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dentate gyrus&lt;/a&gt; cells were filled with a tracer to examine cellular anatomy (white). Engram cells active during fear conditioning were engineered to express the red fluorescent protein mCherry, which appears pink (because of overlap with the white tracer).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A primary truism of neuroscience is that memory storage is mediated by structural and synaptic plasticity. If engram cells are dedicated to preserving specific memories, the next question is: how do you define “a memory”? Most rodent studies search for engram cells associated with memories like “this location = bad”. But what about engrams formed after learning a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00654/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;list of words&lt;/a&gt;? Memories of &lt;i&gt;Tomato&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Attic&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pliers&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Motorcycle&lt;/i&gt;, etc. are presumably represented by overlapping/distinctive groups of engrams distributed across multiple brain regions. What about complex autobiographical memories, like what you did on your 21st birthday? The full day (and night) of festivities consisted of many different events tied together by their temporal proximity and autobiographical significance. Studies of event perception and segmentation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-010419-051101&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zacks, 2020&lt;/a&gt;) are informative in this regard: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;What is the relationship between event structure in perception and that in memory? There is strong evidence that the segments that are identified during event perception correspond to the representational units in subsequent memory. First, the boundaries themselves are remembered exceptionally well. ... Second, event boundaries tended to occur at points in time when many features were changing, and the participants remembered those points better. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Life Beyond Engrams&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The development of an appropriate animal model to allow selective manipulation of the whole-brain engram associated with one “birthday event” (but not the others) seems remote. Likewise, the often-involuntary nature of autobiographical memory retrieval (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721410370301&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bernsten, 2010&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;— in my case, the spontaneous appearance of visual images associated with loss and grief &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;— is not illuminated by current engram research. Nor is the feeling of self-alienation that occurs when those memories start to fade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;“Dwelling in the present moment &lt;br /&gt;    I know this is a wonderful moment.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   –Thich Nhat Hanh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wtf.tw/ref/nhat_hanh_being_peace.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Being Peace&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [PDF]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;i&gt;But the Present Moment usually isn't all that great&lt;/i&gt;,” I say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-019-0150-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;contextual binding&lt;/a&gt;, depending on your degree of hippocampal dependence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Berntsen D.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2020/02/18/how-i-got-a-job-in-industry/&quot;&gt;In my last article&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about how I got a job in industry. I had been programming Python on and off for 10 years when I got my first non-academic job. Having proficiency in a language that people use outside of academia will improve your chances of getting a job in industry. Learning a new language will also grow your abilities as a programmer and will unlock new projects and analyses you might have otherwise been afraid to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What if you’re in a lab that’s been using Matlab for years and you haven’t had a chance to learn Python? Here’s my guide to transition off of Matlab to Python. There are a few specific links to neuroscience at the end of the article, but it should be useful to anybody approaching Python from a Matlab background.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is part 1 of an ongoing series on learning Python. &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/&quot;&gt;Part 2 – picking Python environments, packages and IDEs is here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/&quot;&gt;Part 3 – translating old code with test-driven development is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-jetpack-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Learn Python the hard way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is one of the most popular languages out there – &lt;a href=&quot;http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html&quot;&gt;more popular than Matlab by a factor of at least 10&lt;/a&gt; – and it’s the language the vast majority people transitioning from Matlab will choose. There’s two basic strategies you can apply here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer learning (aka the easy way). You have things in Matlab you use every day – array operations, plotting, signal processing, etc. You learn to do the same thing in Python, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/&quot;&gt;perhaps with the aid of a cheatsheet&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of the Python data science API (numpy, scipy and matplotlib in particular) are very  similar to Matlab. They were originally built to replicate functionality in Matlab. With this route, you’ll get moderately productive very fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting from scratch (aka the hard way). Learn the syntax, then do something you couldn’t do in Matlab, for example:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn algorithms and data structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a GUI application (e.g. in PyQT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a dynamic website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; controversial opinion is you’re better off starting from scratch. If you use the transfer learning method you will be less productive than you currently are for a long time. You will feel annoyed at your own incompetence (&lt;em&gt;&quot;why am I doing this to myself? I could do the same thing twice as fast!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;). Furthermore, you will have a tendency of doing things &lt;em&gt;the Matlab way&lt;/em&gt; (using matrices for everything, index chaining, avoiding for loops) that are error-prone and you shouldn’t be doing in a general purpose programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By starting from scratch you will learn new things you couldn’t do before at all – you will feel like you have new powers. You can write a GUI! You can make dynamic visualizations! You can make games! You can do deep learning! Your day-to-day productivity won’t suffer because you’ll be learning &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; skills instead of relearning old ones poorly. You’ll end up being more productive in Python than you ever were in Matlab. You’ll write idiomatic code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How long will it take to learn Python?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-become-a-professional-python-programmer&quot;&gt;500 hours&lt;/a&gt;. Ok, that number is made up, but it’s probably not far from the truth. You can learn the syntax in a weekend. You can make your first significant project in a few days. &lt;a href=&quot;https://norvig.com/21-days.html&quot;&gt;However, proficiency comes with time&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t wait until 3 weeks before a technical interview to start learning. I’ve seen candidates do this, it’s not good. You’re better off asking for an interview in Matlab if you don’t have hundreds of hours of Python under your belt. Start today, keep at it every day (1-2 hours a day will suffice) and it will pay off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why is Python so popular anyway?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio&quot;&gt;Yoshua Bengio&lt;/a&gt;. Again, I’m halfway joking, but one of the biggest reasons people have moved away from Matlab was the adoption of Python for deep learning. It started with Theano, which came out of Bengio’s lab. It built on numpy, scipy, sklearn and jupyter, all of which predated the rise of deep learning. Then came Tensorflow. People at Google were already using Python; Guido van Rossum, creator of Python, was famously employed by Google at one point. Google needed a high-level language to iterate quickly on models; many of the people involved in Theano were involved in Tensorflow. Python made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could have landed another way. &lt;a href=&quot;http://torch.ch/&quot;&gt;We might all be using Lua instead if Yann had prevailed over Yoshua&lt;/a&gt;! But combine industry pressure, lots of money, the education sector needing a good first language, and open source, and Python is a runaway success now. And it might change in the future. Maybe we’ll all be using Swift in the future. Or Rust. Or Julia (my personal favorite!). For now, Python is the language to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I don’t even hate Matlab&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve used Matlab extensively. I’ve been deep enough to create my own mex files and using Java. I’ve created GUIs in GUIDE. I have created pretty big codebases and classes. I even coded up my own neural net framework which I never published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to bash Matlab here. You can write good code in Matlab – and many people that have been using Matlab for years end up writing disciplined code. However, I have seen a lot of Matlab code of a certain kind – using matrices for everything (even though Matlab has dataframes and hashmaps!), avoiding for loops (even though it has a great JIT!), using a giant set of globals in GUIDE (there’s a way of writing good GUIDE apps, I’m sure!). It will take a little bit of work to unlearn these old habits if you have them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A curriculum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have never seen or touched Python, you can start by learning the syntax and the basic data structures (tuples, dicts, and lists) through online resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sample websites are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.learnpython.org/&quot;&gt;Learn Python&lt;/a&gt;. Skip the numpy and pandas tutorials, we’ll get back to that later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python&quot;&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt;. Similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/&quot;&gt;Learn Python The Hard Way&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of practical exercises in this one. 30$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makeartwithpython.com/&quot;&gt;Make Art With Python&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in games and interactive art this might hold your attention. 30$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these websites will have some sort of live evaluation directly on the website. Pretty soon you’ll need a local install of Python. I recommend installing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/&quot;&gt;Anaconda distribution of Python 3&lt;/a&gt;. This includes the &lt;code&gt;conda&lt;/code&gt; environment manager, which will allow you to maintain different sets of packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Picking a first project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you could consider using Python for a project (no data science stuff yet). The first app I made was a GUI to upload files to a website. A few years later I made an app in PyQT to annotate physiological recordings with notes. You could make a website. Lots of different projects but basically make sure you cover the basics, meaning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;functions – these will trip you up. Python has pass-by-reference semantics for object types. In Matlab, a function cannot modify its arguments (unless it’s a reference object, but these are pretty uncommon). But in Python you can mess with your arguments:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;def my_append_fun(a)
    a.append('b')

c = ['a']
my_append_fun(c)
print(c)
# Prints ['a', 'b']
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not good practice to do this, but you might do it accidentally and you will be very confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modules – in Matlab, one file = one function (unless it’s an internal function private to that file). In Python you can have multiple functions and classes inside a file. Each file defines a module that can be imported. Then there are other people’s modules! pip! Understanding how and when a certain module or function is accessible is one of the subtle things about Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tuples, dicts and lists. A simple write-only type for fixed-length groups; a super-powerful hashmap type; and a variable-length vector. It will take you a while to understand the trade-offs for each of these types. Your assumptions will be wrong! You might think appending to a list in a for loop is super slow because appending to a vector is super slow in Matlab. Wrong! It’s actually super fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;classes. Classes are behaviour + data. Maybe you’ve been doing OOP in Matlab. If not, it’s time to pick it up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strings and file IO. Format strings, &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statements, StringIO, regex – all workaday things in a general purpose programming language that you might never have touched in Matlab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data structures and algorithms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider learning about data structures and algorithms. Many professional programmers are self-taught and never really learn about these fundamentals. They learn intuitively what is slow and fast, and can code many non-trivial algorithms. They might even use complexity analysis (O notation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you learn data structures, your world will open up. This is especially true for people with a Matlab background because the language tends to force you to use the same structure over and over again (the matrix). You might not know what to do with tuples, dicts, lists and objects. You need some solid foundations to transition out of the weird programming model Matlab imposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms&quot;&gt;Algorithms and data structures classes on Coursera by Tim Roughgarden&lt;/a&gt;. These are the same classes you’d get in CS at Stanford, and they are very good. Really tough. You will feel like your mind is melting – in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might try a daily challenge, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hackerrank.com/&quot;&gt;hackerrank&lt;/a&gt;. There’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://projecteuler.net/&quot;&gt;Project Euler&lt;/a&gt; if you’re more math-inclined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The data science ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s finally time learn the data science pipeline. Because you will have learned basic Python well, and the tools are very similar to Matlab, your transition will be very smooth. Here’s one tutorial that guides you through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/matlab-vs-python/&quot;&gt;Python data science ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;. This means getting familiarized with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;matplotlib for plotting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;numpy for matrices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scipy for signal processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pandas for dataframes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sklearn for machine learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jupyter for dynamic notebooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardest package to learn for many people coming from a Matlab background is &lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt;. Why would anyone want to use pandas? &lt;em&gt;Can’t I just use a matrix?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times has your PhD advisor told you to label your axes in your plots? A thousand times? Labeling axes is important to understand what the data means. When you index into an unlabelled matrix, say &lt;code&gt;df(:, 7)&lt;/code&gt;, you’re giving yourself the possibility of forgetting what the data means. Wouldn’t it be better to use &lt;code&gt;df.reaction_time_ms&lt;/code&gt;? Yes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might even have learned how to do reductions, querying and aggregations on raw matrix. This code might give you the mean reaction time for participant 10:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-matlab&quot;&gt;mean(df(df(:, 1)==10, 7))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s bad! What if you add a column in your CSV? Then column 7 becomes column 8, your stats are wrong and you’ll lose months tracking down the issue. This code is super error-prone and makes kittens cry. I’m not saying it’s impossible to do this the right way in Matlab – I’m just saying that’s often how people do it. Compare the pandas way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;df.query('participant_id == 10').reaction_time_ms.mean()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html&quot;&gt;Take the time to read the pandas tutorial in full&lt;/a&gt;. You might want to pick up a book as well after a little while, for instance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/&quot;&gt;Python for Data Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you’ll need to practice your new skills. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/&quot;&gt;Join a Kaggle competition&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science&quot;&gt;follow a data science MOOC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Specialized tools for neuroscience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point you might be productive enough to use Python on a daily basis. Congratulations! It’s a good time to learn about Python neuroscience tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nilearn.github.io/&quot;&gt;nilearn&lt;/a&gt; for machine learning with MRI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&quot;&gt;brian&lt;/a&gt; for spiking neural net simulations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org/&quot;&gt;pytorch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/&quot;&gt;tensorflow&lt;/a&gt; for fitting ANNs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut&quot;&gt;deeplabcut&lt;/a&gt; to track animals without markers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychopy.org/&quot;&gt;Psychopy&lt;/a&gt; for visual stimulus presentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/python-neo&quot;&gt;neo&lt;/a&gt; for managing electrophysiology data in Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mne.tools/dev/auto_tutorials/intro/plot_10_overview.html&quot;&gt;MNE&lt;/a&gt; for EEG analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.pymc.io/&quot;&gt;PyMC3&lt;/a&gt; for Bayesian inference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know of another indispensable tool? Write it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Transition existing pipelines to Matlab&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be hard to transition pipelines developed over years wholesale out of Matlab and into Python. You’ll want to freeze data obtained after running a pipeline into a file format that you can transport from Matlab to Python. &lt;a href=&quot;https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/Reading_mat_files.html&quot;&gt;Matlab’s .mat file format is readable in Python&lt;/a&gt;. Since v7.3 .mat files are in the hdf5 file format, for which Python has excellent support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, you might find that you need Matlab for very little, and only one or two recalcitrant pipelines will need to be maintained. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile&quot;&gt;You could wrap these pipelines in a docker image&lt;/a&gt;, so they keep working for years to come, despite changes in OS and Matlab versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Becoming proficient&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might start developing significant codebases. Will you be putting everything in Dropbox? No, you’ll be using &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;! You’ll need to know the command line. &lt;a href=&quot;https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/index.html&quot;&gt;Follow the software carpentry class&lt;/a&gt; and learn about the Unix terminal and source control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To really step up your game, contribute to an open-source project. If you’re unsure where to start, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainhack.org/&quot;&gt;join a Brainhack event&lt;/a&gt; – people will ask for volunteers for their projects and they’ll guide you through the process of making a submission. Friendships will be created! Collaborations hatched! Bagels will be had!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you’ll feel the need for speed at this point. Tear through billion row datasets with &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.pymc.io/&quot;&gt;Spark&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://dask.org/&quot;&gt;dask&lt;/a&gt;. JIT your for loops or compile them down to C with &lt;a href=&quot;https://cython.org/&quot;&gt;Cython&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://numba.pydata.org/&quot;&gt;numba&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/jax&quot;&gt;jax&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://rlouf.github.io/post/jax-random-walk-metropolis/&quot;&gt;Monte Carlo simulations with a thousand parallel chains&lt;/a&gt;? Not a problem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make it social&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don’t realize how social programming is. As a software engineer at Google, I:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learned about the core tooling in seminars with other engineers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had people review my code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviewed other people’s code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pair programmed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared analyses with other people who critiqued the analysis (both the content and the method)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went to retreats to learn new tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organized a reading group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned more from these experiences than from much of the book reading and solitary programming I’ve done. You don’t have to make your learning journey an isolating one. When you do Kaggle, join a team. Go to local meetups – in Montreal for instance, there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/pitonneux/&quot;&gt;Les Pitonneux&lt;/a&gt;, who meet up almost daily. Many groups focus on supporting underrepresented groups in computer science, for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pyladies.com/&quot;&gt;PyLadies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are hackerspaces where you might find people in the same situation. You can go to tutorial sessions at conferences. Make friends and create a social support system to help you on your journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had to relearn programming many times over the years. Toolbook, QBasic, VB, Delphi, Actionscript, Perl, PHP – I’ve written significant chunks of code in each of these languages. They’re all either dead or on their way out. Having seen the trajectory of these languages, it feels to me like Matlab is on its way out as well. This doesn’t mean it won’t be used at all – after all, PHP is 10 times less popular today than at its peak, but it still runs Facebook! But it does mean that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be more people who know Matlab than people who are hiring people who know Matlab. It won’t do you any favors on your CV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professionals software engineers have already switched away from Matlab. You will have a lot of trouble hiring professional programmers to create Matlab-based infrastructure in your future lab if you choose to stay in academia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Mathworks is a single-source vendor, and their software is closed-source. What happens if they run out of business?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time to move away from Matlab. Take the first step today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="fr-FR">
 &lt;p&gt;Dans les billets précédents (&lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/une-analyse-globale-de-la-nouvelle-politique-de-recherche-i-le-contexte-ideologique/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; et &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/une-analyse-globale-de-la-nouvelle-politique-de-recherche-ii-prejuges-psychologiques-de-lideologie-manageriale/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;), j’ai exposé le contexte idéologique des réformes structurelles de la recherche qui sont en cours. J’ai tenté de montrer qu’il s’agit de théories bureaucratiques dont l’argumentation est essentiellement obscurantiste, c’est-à-dire que non seulement une série de poncifs (il vaut mieux financer les excellents que les mauvais) et d’analogies douteuses (les vertus supposées du « darwinisme ») tiennent lieu d’argumentation, mais en outre les éléments empiriques contradictoires sont tout simplement ignorés.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Face à ce type de critique, une réaction courante est : mais alors, vous refusez d’être évalués ? On convoque alors l’image du savant dans sa tour d’ivoire, ou pire, celle du fonctionnaire fainéant. En effet, un point central des réformes managériales en cours est la notion d’évaluation : il faudrait développer une « culture de l’évaluation », avec des « indicateurs de performance ». Faut-il évaluer la recherche ? Pour répondre à cette question, encore faut-il préciser ce que l’on entend par « évaluer » et quels sont précisément les sujets et objets de ce verbe (qui évalue, et qu’est-ce qui est évalué).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pour cela, il me semble utile de faire une petite digression philosophique pour comprendre la nature de l’activité scientifique qu’il s’agit d’évaluer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digression philosophique&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qu’est-ce que la science ? Vaste question philosophique qui a été abordée par de nombreux angles et que je me propose de résumer en quelques paragraphes. Je me contenterai pour le sujet de ce billet d’une description assez grossière : la science, en tant qu’activité sociale, est la poursuite de la vérité. Description néanmoins un peu plus subtile qu’elle en a l’air : il s’agit bien de tendre vers un idéal de vérité sur le monde, mais c’est un idéal, c’est-à-dire quelque chose que l’on poursuit sans jamais vraiment atteindre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comment la science est-elle produite ? Une position philosophique historiquement importante, qui date du 19&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle et début du 20&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;, est le positivisme : la science consiste à observer des faits élémentaires, puis à en déduire logiquement des lois de la nature. Il y a donc une méthode que l’on peut suivre pour produire des vérités scientifiques avec certitude. C’est en quelque sorte un modèle industriel de la science, et ce n’est sans doute pas un hasard si cette position est apparue au 19&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle. De ce point de vue découle la conception naïve de la revue par les pairs comme certification des connaissances produites ou des méthodes employées. Point crucial, selon ce modèle de la science, il est trivial de distinguer la bonne science de la mauvaise science : la bonne science est tout simplement celle qui suit correctement la méthode scientifique (d’où le rôle présumé des journaux comme « gate-keepers » ; voir mon &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/revues-predatrices-quel-est-le-probleme/&quot;&gt;texte sur ce sujet&lt;/a&gt;). Dans ce modèle, on peut donc appliquer des méthodes industrielles de gestion, de « management » dirait-on aujourd’hui, parce qu’il existe des mesures objectives (externes) de qualité. Là est la justification de l’usage de la bibliométrie comme outil d’évaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, si cette position reste populaire, en particulier chez les non chercheurs (mais pas seulement), elle a été essentiellement démolie par les travaux en philosophie et histoire des sciences au cours du siècle dernier. Le plus connu est sans doute Karl Popper, qui sous un angle logique a établi que l’on ne peut pas établir en science des vérités mais uniquement des faussetés - simplement parce qu’une proposition s’applique à une infinité de cas que l’on ne peut tous vérifier. Il s’agit alors de tester des théories, et non de déduire des vérités scientifiques. D’autres travaux, moins connus des scientifiques mais néanmoins très importants, ont montré que la difficulté est plus profonde que cela. Quine a montré que la notion même de fait élémentaire est une erreur conceptuelle. C’est une forme de réductionnisme de la connaissance (je reformule), l’idée que la connaissance est un ensemble de faits et lois indépendants les uns des autres. Or c’est impossible, car pour énoncer un fait il faut utiliser des concepts, c’est-à-dire des théories. Par conséquent, il n’y a pas de fait élémentaire mais plutôt un système (plus ou moins) cohérent de connaissances. Kuhn a montré historiquement que co-existent généralement des théories scientifiques contradictoires portant sur les mêmes observations, ou encore que différentes théories (ou écoles de pensée) considèrent comme pertinents des corpus d’observations différents. Lakatos (élève de Popper) a montré qu’une théorie scientifique est non seulement une théorie qui en principe doit être falsifiable, mais également qui en pratique est falsifiée, et que cette caractéristique n’est pas forcément dysfonctionnelle. C’est-à-dire qu’il arrive couramment que des observations inattendues semblent contredire la théorie dominante, mais pour autant la théorie n’est pas forcément remise en cause. A la place, l’observation est interprétée en postulant une hypothèse auxiliaire. C’est le cas presque systématiquement aujourd’hui dans de nombreuses branches de la physique parce que l’on considère les théories physiques bien établies. Par exemple : la trajectoire de telle planète dévie des prédictions des lois de Newton (ou Einstein), conclusion : il doit y avoir un satellite autour de cette planète (et non : les lois de Newton sont fausses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je pourrais citer de nombreuses autres contributions importantes. Pour le sujet qui nous occupe, le point important est qu’il n’existe pas de méthode scientifique que l’on pourrait appliquer pour produire des vérités scientifiques. Cela ne veut pas dire que la science est arbitraire, au contraire. Cela veut dire que la réflexion sur la méthodologie et plus globalement l’épistémologie font elles-mêmes partie intégrale de l’activité scientifique : il n’y a pas de norme objective externe à la communauté scientifique. Cela signifie que la science progresse non par la production et la certification des savoirs, mais par le débat scientifique. Ce point est crucial, car il fonde la justification fondamentale de la nécessaire autonomie scientifique. Il ne peut y avoir d’évaluation de la production scientifique selon des normes externes (notamment bibliométriques), tout simplement parce que ces normes n’existent pas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evaluer la recherche&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenons donc à notre question : faut-il évaluer la recherche ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premièrement, commençons par la motivation de cette question. La motivation, c’est que l’argent public doit être bien utilisé, c’est-à-dire dans l’intérêt de la société. Cela implique sans doute que les politiques publiques doivent être évaluées, c’est-à-dire que lorsque l’on modifie la structure du système de recherche par des réformes, l’impact global de ces réformes devrait être analysé. Or c’est précisément le type d’évaluation utile qui n’est pas effectué, ou qui est ignoré. Les réformes engagées depuis 15 ans, introduisant des nouveaux modes d’organisation (financement par projets par exemple) n’ont manifestement pas donné les résultats escomptés. Il serait donc logique de revenir sur ces réformes et de les modifier. Or ce n’est pas le cas : au contraire, il s’agirait d’amplifier ces réformes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ce qui doit être évalué donc, c’est l’efficacité globale du système de recherche, en relation avec son organisation. Si le système global doit être évalué, est-ce qu’il en découle que les agents individuels de ce système doivent être évalués ? Il y a ici un glissement qui est tout à fait fallacieux. Bien sûr, si l’on veut connaître, disons, la production scientifique totale du pays, on va additionner la production scientifique de chacun des chercheurs. Du point de vue individuel, cette « évaluation » est donc faite dans un but de mesure uniquement ; c’est seulement au niveau du système global que cette mesure sert à influencer l’action publique. Mais quand on dit qu’il faut évaluer les chercheurs, ce dont on parle c’est une évaluation qui a une conséquence individuelle et qui est donc utilisée comme outil de gestion. Par exemple, on donne une prime aux chercheurs qui publient plus, de façon à les inciter à augmenter leur productivité. Il ne s’agit donc ici pas simplement d’évaluer les politiques publiques, ce qui semble assez consensuel, mais d’instaurer un mode de gestion bien particulier, à savoir une gestion bureaucratique managériale, reposant sur des indicateurs individuels objectifs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or comme je l’ai expliqué plus haut, il n’existe pas d’indicateurs objectifs de la qualité scientifique à un niveau individuel. On peut dire d’un pays qu’il produit plus ou moins d’articles scientifiques, ou mesurer différents indicateurs macroscopiques. Mais aucune bureaucratie ne peut dire ce qui est « vrai » ou « important » en termes de vérité scientifique, puisque c’est justement là le cœur de l’activité des chercheurs. Une conséquence immédiate de cet état de fait est qu’instaurer une gestion par objectifs est nécessairement contre-productif, puisque les agents vont alors être incités à optimiser des choses qui ne sont pas alignées avec la qualité scientifique, chose non mesurable. C’est d’ailleurs un phénomène tellement bien connu qu’il a un nom, la &lt;a href=&quot;https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loi_de_Goodhart&quot;&gt;loi de Goodhart&lt;/a&gt;. Par exemple, demander aux chercheurs de produire davantage d’articles a pour résultat que les chercheurs produisent davantage d’articles. Par exemple en saucissonnant les articles, en faisant des articles bâclés, etc. Cela fonctionne pour toute métrique qu’un bureaucrate pourra inventer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mais alors, il ne faut pas évaluer ? Premièrement, l’évaluation, comme je l’ai expliqué, est un aspect central et quotidien de l’activité du chercheur, si l’on entend cela comme la discussion critique des productions scientifiques. C’est le métier du chercheur que d’évaluer ses pairs - le mot « évaluer » est sans doute mauvais, du fait qu’il ne s’agit bien sûr pas de mettre cinq étoiles à la loi de la relativité. Simplement, cette évaluation n’est pas un mode de gestion, mais de débat, et ce débat ne peut se faire qu’entre pairs, pas avec une bureaucratie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuxièmement, l’évaluation des personnes (et non plus des énoncés scientifiques) est naturellement inévitable à au moins un moment de la carrière : le recrutement (et, sans doute, la promotion). Mais encore une fois, cette évaluation ne peut être faite de manière bureaucratique selon des métriques objectives pour les raisons déjà énoncées. Elle ne peut se faire que par des pairs, de manière subjective donc. De quel genre d’évaluation parle-t-on ici ? Le discours managérial parle de « culture du résultat » : il s’agirait d’évaluer la production des individus ; à charge des individus que faire en sorte que cette production soit bonne – d’où une forme de « sélection darwinienne ». D’où un certain nombre d’indicateurs (nombre de publications, prestige des journaux dans lesquels elles apparaissent, etc). Mais d’une part on retombe encore une fois dans l’erreur positiviste (il n’y a pas, surtout sur des résultats récents, de mesure consensuelle de l’« importance » de résultats scientifiques) et d’autre part on commet ce qu’on appelle en psychologie un &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_substitution&quot;&gt;biais de substitution&lt;/a&gt;, c’est-à-dire que le facteur que l’on cherche à évaluer est complexe et par conséquent on en utilise un autre plus simple (voir une &lt;a href=&quot;http://romainbrette.fr/category/blog/hiring-committees/&quot;&gt;série de textes&lt;/a&gt; que j’ai écrits il y a quelques années sur les biais cognitifs dans les recrutements académiques). Que cherche-t-on à évaluer lors d’un recrutement de chercheur permanent ? Il s’agit d’estimer si, au cours de sa carrière &lt;em&gt;future&lt;/em&gt;, le chercheur produira des connaissances nouvelles et intéressantes. Bien sûr on ne connait pas sa carrière future, on doit donc la deviner. Et qu’est-ce qui détermine la qualité de la production scientifique d’un individu ? Un certain nombre de facteurs, dont certains sont propres à la personne, comme ses compétences et ses qualités (rigueur intellectuelle et intégrité par exemple), et d’autres sont contextuels (collaborateurs, conditions de travail, et bien sûr hasard puisqu’on parle de recherche, donc de choses non connues à l’avance). Ce que l’on doit donc déterminer, dans le contexte d’un recrutement, ce sont les facteurs propres, c’est-à-dire les compétences et qualités scientifiques de l’individu. La production passée est bien sûr corrélée à ces facteurs, mais ce n’est pas ce que l’on cherche à déterminer. Enfin il y a un risque bien connu à substituer un facteur indirect au facteur causal que l’on cherche à évaluer. En plus de l’erreur dans la sélection elle-même, cette substitution induit des changements de comportement des individus visant à optimiser ce facteur non causal, ce qui finit par rendre la sélection arbitraire (loi de Goodhart). Par exemple, un étudiant ira dans un laboratoire connu non parce qu’il pense y apprendre quelque chose, mais parce qu’il a plus de chances d’être co-auteur d’un article dans un journal prestigieux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L’évaluation, donc, doit être une évaluation des compétences et non des résultats. Naturellement, les compétences ne peuvent être correctement évaluées que par des gens eux-mêmes compétents, et non par une bureaucratie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faut-il évaluer la recherche ? D’abord, il faut principalement évaluer les politiques publiques de recherche. Celles qui sont instituées depuis 15 ans sont manifestement mauvaises et il faut donc les repenser et non les amplifier. Voilà l’évidence. Ensuite, oui bien sûr, il est nécessaire d’évaluer les chercheurs, au moment du recrutement ou de la promotion, et non comme mode de gestion quotidien. Et ce sont les compétences qui doivent être évaluées et non les « résultats ». Ces compétences, enfin, ne peuvent être évaluées que par des gens eux-mêmes compétents et non par des bureaucrates. Voilà en quel sens on peut dire qu’il faut « évaluer la recherche ».&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/people-2592030_640-140x110.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are a junior reporter on a busy local newspaper. Your editor has asked you to cover the suicide of a young man who lived in the town with his parents. You have been to their house but they would only speak to you through the door. It was clear they were not keen to be interviewed. Your editor is putting pressure on you to meet the copy deadline with something that will engage readers. What do you do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-8211-1&quot;&gt;Our research study&lt;/a&gt; published today in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; describes the perspectives of bereaved relatives like those portrayed in this vignette, and provides examples of conflicts between their need for privacy and journalists’ need to do their job. Among the 140 suicide-bereaved relatives or friends who responded to our online survey, many described perceptions of journalists’ intrusive behavior, a failure to consult them appropriately, and inaccuracy in reporting. However, some individuals described the press coverage as an opportunity to raise awareness and prevent further suicides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-11691&quot; height=&quot;184&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/samaritans-volunteer-image-1-for-jan18-issue-300x184.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Samaritans has published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/media-guidelines/&quot;&gt;media guidelines on how to safely report on suicide &lt;/a&gt;and additional &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.samaritans.org/documents/Media_guidelines_-_Working_with_bereaved_families_factsheet_UK_Final.pdf&quot;&gt;guidance on working with bereaved families&lt;/a&gt;, to protect bereaved relatives from unnecessary distress, as well as protecting the public from the potential harms of irresponsible reporting. This is important because research shows that people bereaved by suicide are at &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2215-0366(14)70224-X&quot;&gt;greater risk of suicide&lt;/a&gt; themselves, and insensitive reporting can increase their distress. It is also important because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6066401/&quot;&gt;irresponsible reporting is implicated in inducing further suicides&lt;/a&gt;. Supporting the media to report on suicide responsibly is a key feature of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/publications-detail/preventing-suicide-a-global-imperative&quot;&gt;public health policy on suicide prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health researchers recognize that journalists find themselves in a difficult position when expected to report on someone’s suicide, whether the deceased was in the public eye or otherwise. On reading our research findings Lorna Fraser, Samaritans’ Media Advice Service lead, commented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reporting suicides can be one of the most challenging issues journalists face, where they must balance reporting a topic which is in the public interest, with avoiding any intrusion into the grief and shock of the bereaved loved ones left behind. It’s vitally important that journalists are aware of media guidelines and follow this best practice advice, due to the many sensitivities and risks surrounding this topic. We regularly hear from bereaved families with concerns about approaches from journalists and a lack of sensitivity with how their loved one’s death was reported. We ask journalists to bear in mind these are people who may be in shock and struggling to come to terms with their devastating loss. They may not even be aware that their relative’s death will be reported in the press. Many will consider this a personal issue and value the space to grieve in private. In addition to our media guidelines, Samaritans provides an advice service to media. Journalists can email us at: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:mediaadvice@samaritans.org&quot;&gt;mediaadvice@samaritans.org&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11692 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;135&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/supportaftersuicide-300x135.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Sarah Bates, Executive Lead of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://supportaftersuicide.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Support after Suicide Partnership&lt;/a&gt; added “Suicide is absolutely devastating, and insensitive reporting of suicide can have a hugely damaging impact on both people directly affected by the death being reported, as well as anyone who has had a similar experience in the past, sometimes going back many years. At the same time, the press face real challenges when reporting on suicide in the public interest. There is such a need for responsible, informed, and sensitive reporting, consistent with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/media-guidelines/&quot;&gt;Samaritans media guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. Reporting must put the grieving family, friends, colleagues and professionals at the heart of every journalists’ approach. As Lorna mentions, journalists are often involved very soon after a death is reported, often before support services are able to establish a relationship with a grieving family. Therefore, the journalist may suggest that the family nominate a ‘spokesperson’ who can act as a bridge between the press and those most impacted – and have honest, open, and sensitive communication.  We feel that some of the vital aspects to responsible reporting include not giving too much detail when mentioning method or location, avoiding unnecessary use of images and always making sure that readers are directed towards the support that is available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mybrotherkilledhimself.wordpress.com/about/&quot;&gt;Emma Bird&lt;/a&gt;, a journalist and blogger who has experienced suicide bereavement herself, commented:  “I welcome this research. Having lost my brother to suicide, I am now an unquestionably better journalist than I was before he died. I have the qualities that good journalists are supposed to have: I’m a good listener, I’m empathetic and people confide in me. But even so, if I had known back then what I know now, I wouldn’t have made such a hash up of door knocks and inquests. I have no qualms about suicides being reported but this must be done in a way that is sensitive to the bereaved and with an awareness for what they are going through.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key message of our research is that if the right approach is taken, journalists can potentially collaborate with bereaved relatives to write a story that both respects the bounds of their privacy and avoids misrepresenting the deceased. Additionally, by providing information on how to contact appropriate local and national sources of support, a news article can encourage people experiencing emotional problems or suicidal thoughts to seek help. In this way, journalism can be used to positive ends, reducing the potential for distress to relatives and enhancing communication of suicide prevention messages.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/left-brain-right-brain-myth/"/>

		<updated>2020-02-20T07:49:02+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;I’m a neuroscientist by trade. Popular culture would most likely label me ‘&lt;em&gt;logical, detail-oriented and analytical’ &lt;/em&gt;(which I am!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT when I was in high school, I considered applying to art school and pursuing a career as a painter. And I dabble in botanical watercolour and love designing in &lt;a class=&quot;broken_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.canva.com/&quot;&gt;Canva&lt;/a&gt;. You could also label me &lt;em&gt;‘creative, thoughtful and artistic.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt you’ve heard the concept that the left side of the brain is logical and analytical, whereas the right side of the brain is artistic and creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you even landed on this article because you googled the phrase and arrived here? (You’re very welcome!!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that personality or cognitive processes (ways of thinking) are cultivated on one side of the brain or other, giving rise to the rather nifty idea that you are right-brained &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; left-brained, creative &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; analytical … neuroscientist &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No evidence from brain scans that people are ‘rig&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-6157 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;228&quot; src=&quot;http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brain-2062057_1920-300x228.jpg&quot; style=&quot;color: #555555; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;ht-brained’ versus ‘left-brained’.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This popular notion was debunked in 2013 by University of Utah neuroscientists who used brain imaging to show &lt;em&gt;there is NO evidence that people are ‘right-brained’ or ‘left-brained’. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team from the University of Utah scanned the brains of 1,011 people between the ages of seven and 29. They used a technique called resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI)… forget about that mouthful for now. The study tested the idea that one half of a person’s brain is more active, more connected and more synchronised than the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team divided each person’s brain into over 7,000 regions and examined each region to see if it showed stronger activity on the left or the right side of the brain. They also looked for connections between regions that were more localised (also called ‘lateralised’) to one hemisphere or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, as Jared Nielsen, a PhD student who worked on the study, said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…we just don’t see patterns where the whole left-brain network is more connected or the whole right-brain network is more connected in some people. It may be that personality types have nothing to do with one hemisphere being more active, stronger, or more connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientist Dr Jeff Anderson, lead author of the study, said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s absolutely true that some brain functions occur in one or the other side of the brain. Language tends to be on the left, attention more on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But people don’t tend to have a stronger left- or right-sided brain network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; font-size: 20px;&quot;&gt;How did the left-brain vs right-brain myth come about?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two hemispheres of the brain are &lt;i&gt;slightly&lt;/i&gt; different anatomically and microscopically (which means they look a bit different when you look at them with your eyes and down the microscope).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, the two hemispheres of the brain (connected by the corpus callosum) do perform different jobs. In the industry, we call this lateralisation of brain function. Lateralisation is the tendency for some neural functions or processes to be specialised to one side of the brain or the other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the left side of the brain controls movement on the right side of the body and vice-versa. Speech and language, are typically jobs performed by the left hemisphere. But not &lt;em&gt;ALL&lt;/em&gt; aspects of speech are left-sided. Intonation, for example, is found on the right. As an interesting aside…language and ‘handed-ness’ are related. Whereas 97% of right-handed people have their speech centre on the left, only 70% of left-handers do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, studies of patients with tumours or stroke show that our sense of our body and limbs in space (proprioception) is more likely located in the right hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some neuroscientists theorise that these differences and the brain asymmetries of language, spatial perception and handedness probably led to the prevailing myth that personality and styles of thinking are also located to one hemisphere or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But what if &lt;em&gt;I AM&lt;/em&gt; a right-brain creative type?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Everyone has talents, and everyone has weaknesses they need to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognise and foster your talents. Set goals and develop new skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just don’t attribute ‘whole brain’, global functions or personality or career choices to one hemisphere of the brain being weaker or stronger than the other. The brain is way more complex (and interesting) than that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is there a problem with using left-brain versus right-brain … just for fun?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem that has arisen from this mythology is the raft of books, tests, apps, workshops and online games that exploit the myth by promising to help you ‘tap into your creative right brain’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine — if you want to spend your money on them and expand on skills and knowledge that you may not already have. BUT this simplistic right-brained vs left-brained view is not grounded in our contemporary understanding of how the brain works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, believing that you are ‘creative but not analytical’, or ‘logical and unintuitive’ and that is hard-wired into your brain, is a rather limiting belief and probably becomes self-fulfilling after a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Jarrett who writes for Psychology Today sums my thoughts up perfectly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suppose the logical left-brain, creative right-brain myth has a seductive simplicity about it. People can ask – which kind of brain have I got? They can buy an app to target their weaker half. They can categorise languages and people as right-brained or left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s tricky to combat that belief system by saying the truth is really more complicated. But it’s worth trying, because it would be a shame if the simplistic myth drowned out the more fascinating story of how our brains really work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We think that there is a significant opportunity for institutions and funders to prioritize partnerships with native OA publishers who stand fully aligned with their OA objectives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have been reassured by the commitment from institutions and consortia not to sideline negotiations with (and thereby disadvantage) native OA publishers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: How many articles do you envisage UC faculty publishing with PLOS during the two-year period of the agreement?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AM: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;If we base it on previous years, then around 600-800 articles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: How many articles a year do UC faculty currently publish with PLOS?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AM:&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Around 300 per year, across the seven journals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: As I understand it, the agreement means that UC faculty will be able to publish in any PLOS journal and the first $1,000 will be paid by UC libraries. If the researcher has access to no research funds s/he can request full funding from the libraries. Is there any maximum sum agreed with UC libraries such that the funds could run out before the pilot ends?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AM:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Yes, we have agreed to a capped total spend of $1.5M USD over the two-year period. This cap reflects library spend &lt;i&gt;plus&lt;/i&gt; grant funding declared by authors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once that spending cap is reached, PLOS has committed to cover the cost of additional UC publications (assuming UC authors continue to faithfully declare their existing grant funding, a two year spend is most likely to fall between $1.2M and $1.25M).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$1.5M would demonstrate an unprecedented increase in publications from the UC – but of course, a key unknown is the level of demand once the barrier of APCs is removed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;If for some reason, we reach this cap earlier in the agreement period than expected (if at all), we have agreed to good faith renegotiations to ensure that both PLOS and the UC are protected from unanticipated surges in cost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Will the details of the agreement be published?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AM:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Yes – as are all of the UC agreements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: PLOS has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plos.org/institutional-account-participants&quot;&gt;Institutional Account Program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;of which I do not think UC is currently a participant. What is the difference between the agreement announced today and UC simply signing up to become a participant of the IAP?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AM:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; The Institutional Account Program is a simple direct billing program meant to minimize administrative overhead of APCs either through pay-as-you-go monthly invoices or debiting from a standalone account. While useful for mitigating administrative costs, it is not an OA &lt;i&gt;deal&lt;/i&gt;, or transformative, in and of itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This new deal enables the UC to allow grants to cover APCs when they exist, so they can focus their support on where it is needed most (i.e. where authors do not have the grant funds). It introduces an organized, multiple-payer model of OA, which we think is important to test out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And it meets our primary goals with new business models of ensuring that any author who wants to can publish with PLOS, regardless of ability to pay an APC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;Number of questions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Is PLOS talking to other universities/consortia with a view to signing similar arrangements with them?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AM:&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yes, absolutely. We’ve asked ourselves a number of questions in approaching these arrangements:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;·&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;How do we make the next phase of “open” in scholarly publishing as equitable and inclusive as possible? To us, APCs cannot be the be-all and end-all of this “transition to open”. This shift should be characterized by multiple business models that meet authors and institutions where they are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;·&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What do institutions and consortia need from us as a publisher? Depending on region, research focus, institution-type etc., our partners have different needs and pain points. It might be alleviating the high cost of APC administration.

We’ve seen that APC price increases have shown little relation to the costs they’re meant to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liberquarterly.eu/articles/10.18352/lq.10280/&quot;&gt;represent&lt;/a&gt; (hence the value of the Plan S transparency &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/coalition-s-welcomes-transparency-framework-and-report-launches-pilot/&quot;&gt;pilot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coalition-s.org/coalition-s-welcomes-transparency-framework-and-report-launches-pilot/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;PLOS is participating in with other publishers). We’ve also seen that authors are still choosing to publish with “prestige” journals regardless of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liberquarterly.eu/articles/10.18352/lq.10280/&quot;&gt;cost of APCs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This suggests that focusing on authors to play the cost management role is unrealistic – it makes far more sense for this to sit with libraries, who have the relevant skills and experience. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this particular case, the key component is the $1.5M USD price cap over the two years (which caps spend from both the library and authors’ own funding sources). This represents risk for both PLOS and the UC but both sides are committed to learning and adapting as we go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: How would you respond to someone who suggested that these deals are therefore a step backwards?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AM:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; With polite disagreement! As noted above, we need a range of models for different needs and while we absolutely want to find strong alternative business models, it’s clear that APCs still have some role to play.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I have been clear about &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/06/03/plan-s-and-the-transformation-of-scholarly-communication-are-we-missing-the-woods/&quot;&gt;concerns with transformative agreements&lt;/a&gt;, especially from the large commercial publishers, but as with so many things, there’s important nuance. Deals such as this still meet important goals for PLOS, including making it possible for more researchers to publish with us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It goes a long way towards ensuring equity &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; author price awareness by asking authors to honestly represent their funding situation while simultaneously making native OA publishing an option for those with no funding.

BMC, for instance, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.springer.com/about+springer/media/pressreleases?SGWID=0-11002-6-805003-0&quot;&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.springer.com/about+springer/media/pressreleases?SGWID=0-11002-6-805003-0&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;by Springer in 2008; SSRN and bepress were acquired by Elsevier in &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/05/17/elsevier-acquires-ssrn/&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/08/02/elsevier-acquires-bepress/&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/05/17/elsevier-acquires-ssrn/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;and in January F1000Research was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebookseller.com/news/taylor-francis-buys-f1000-research-ltd-1150791&quot;&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebookseller.com/news/taylor-francis-buys-f1000-research-ltd-1150791&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;by Taylor and Francis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;These, of course, were all for-profits whereas PLOS is a non-profit. However, we could note that – to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.openbookpublishers.com/open-book-publishers-statement-on-knowledge-unlatched-and-the-open-research-library&quot;&gt;consternation&lt;/a&gt; of many in the open access movement – in 2016 the non-profit Knowledge Unlatched was &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2018/10/03/knowledge-unlatched-failed-transparency-and-the-commercialisation-of-open-access-book-publishing/&quot;&gt;transformed&lt;/a&gt; from a UK non-profit CIC to a for-profit GmbH and relocated to Berlin. Explaining why it was necessary KU founder Frances Pinter &lt;a href=&quot;https://poynder.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-oa-interviews-frances-pinter.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, “As a not-for-profit CIC with few assets, we were not able to take on commercial loans. Grant-giving bodies and philanthropic funders regarded the proof of concept as a success – and therefore not requiring further funding from them.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last November, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Scholarly Kitchen&lt;i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/11/22/is-plos-running-out-of-time/&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;that in 2018 PLOS ran a $5.5 million deficit on $32M dollars of revenue, and so it is presumably in a vulnerable situation. Is it technically/legally possible that PLOS could undergo a similar transformation from non-profit to for-profit status and then be acquired by, say, Elsevier or Springer? What is to stop that happening?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AM:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; PLOS has been pretty open about the fact that 2018 was a year of major transformation. Having made the decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/12/20/end-aperta-journal-submission-systems-remain-challenging/&quot;&gt;discontinue development of Aperta&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2017, our results in 2018 reflect both the write-off of that investment and significant organizational restructuring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’ve gone through a careful, and sometimes painful, process of deconstructing what wasn’t sustainable and reconstructing in ways that position us for long-term impact and sustainability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;These decisions led to a significant turnaround in 2019 and a surplus of well over $1m (our first meaningful surplus since 2014) – and we still have a substantial cash reserve to fund future investment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So we are entering 2020 both excited and confident of our future. Equally importantly, we’ve become much clearer about redefining how we innovate and lead – this is the work that PLOS was born to do. Leading the way in development of equitable and sustainable business models for OA is one important aspect of our work in continuing to push the boundaries of “open”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Finally, can you say what PLOS’ priorities are for 2020?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;AM:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; We’d prefer to focus on the UC announcement, and we hope that the responses above showcase enough of our 2020 priorities for now! Ask us again sometime...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP: Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: PLOS and the University of California issued the following press release on Wednesday, February 19th at 9:00am PST.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — The Public Library of Science (PLOS) and the University of California (UC) today announced a two-year agreement that will make it easier and more affordable for UC researchers to publish in the nonprofit open access publisher’s suite of journals. By bringing together PLOS, one of the world’s leading native open access publishers, and UC, which accounts for nearly 10 percent of all U.S. publishing output, the pilot breaks new ground in the global movement to advance open access publishing and empower more authors to share their research with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Scientific research is increasingly an international endeavor, often at its best when it crosses conceptual, disciplinary, and technological boundaries,” said Keith Yamamoto, Vice Chancellor for Science Policy and Strategy and Professor of Cellular Molecular Pharmacology at UC San Francisco, and a member of the PLOS Board of Directors. “Building that global continuum of discovery demands open, efficient, and rapid distribution of information. This agreement shows that key institutional stakeholders — universities and publishers — can work cooperatively to develop sustainable models that serve science, scientists, and trainees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, which the partners are working to implement this spring, the UC Libraries will automatically pay the first $1,000 of the article processing charge (APC) for all UC authors who choose to publish in a PLOS journal. Authors who do not have research funds available can request full funding of the article processing charge from the libraries, ensuring that lack of research funds does not present a barrier for UC authors who wish to publish in PLOS journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pilot will illustrate that an institutional participation model that leverages multiple funding sources, rather than only grant funds, can enable a sustainable and inclusive path to full open access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This agreement is the result of open and fully collaborative discussions,” said Alison Mudditt, CEO of PLOS. “Open access publishers and libraries are natural allies, and we’re thrilled our first agreement is with UC, given their reputation for strong action supporting open access in the market. Open access is evolving. We have a duty to meet those changing needs with solutions that ensure the future of open access is accessible for all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most institutional agreements have so far focused on subscription publishers that are transitioning to open access. PLOS and UC believe that institutional agreements of this kind can and should include native open access publishers since they are already aligned with current and emerging OA policies and mandates. This pilot builds upon UC’s commitment to a level playing field that supports all authors and all publishers in alignment with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/uc-publisher-relationships/guidelines-for-evaluating-transformative-open-access-agreements/&quot;&gt;university’s guidelines for evaluating transformative agreements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“UC and PLOS have a long and close relationship as leaders in open access publishing — and this pilot builds on that partnership,” said Ivy Anderson, associate executive director of UC’s California Digital Library and co-chair of the team overseeing UC’s publisher negotiations. “We want to make it easier and more affordable for researchers to choose open access journals like PLOS when deciding where to submit their work for publication. We intend to continue to partner with a variety of publishers so that together we can help lead the transition to full open access.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
